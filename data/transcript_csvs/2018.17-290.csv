2018.17-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.56,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-290, Merck Sharp & Dohme versus Albrecht. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,7.56,28.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' express theory is that the FDA, fully informed of the risk of atypical femoral fractures, ignored that risk and its own statutory and regulatory responsibilities because it didn't like the way Merck phrased its proposed warning. That cannot be right."
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,64.28,95.36,"Mr. Dvoretzky, let me give you a -- a -- a hypothetical because I think we can -- could all agree that if you had proposed a warning, let -- let me just say major -- major fractures versus stress fractures, and if you had proposed a warning that dealt with major fractures and the FDA had said no, we don't think that the literature supports that, then there's nothing you can do, and you should be immune from any suit. I think that that's pretty clear."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,148.96,155.68,I don't think that you're necessarily off the hook in that situation because you haven't warned about the relevant risk.
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,171.48,171.6,Okay.
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,228.0,259.6,"I don't think that's quite right, Justice Kagan, because you have to look not only at the warning that was proposed but also at the information that was in front of the FDA about the risk. And this is where, again, the FDA's complete response letter has to be understood in light of the FDA's statutory obligations. Under 355(o)(4), the -- the Secretary is obligated, if it believes that something should be include in the label -- included in the label of the warning, it shall promptly have a back and forth with the manufacturer about that."
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,259.6,260.2,"Yeah, but, you see, that's --"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,260.2,260.68,And so --
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,260.68,296.44,"-- that's the reason I asked that question about the ovarian cancer and the ovarian cysts, because I think you could say on a -- on something like that, well, look, it's true that our -- our proposal talked about ovarian cysts, but we gave them all of this data, and if they had really looked at all of the data, they would have seen that it -- it -- there's a real risk of -- of causing ovarian cancer, and the fact that they didn't tell us immediately to change our label means that we're exempt from suit. And I would think that that is not a good understanding of the statute."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,333.04,349.32,"And for that reason, I think that would be a different and more difficult case than the one that we have here. But, here, the complete response letter has to be understood both in light of what it says but also against the backdrop of the FDA's regulatory duties and the back and forth that the FDA --"
2018.17-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.32,366.44,Why? Please point me to where in the complete response letter you say that they were -- thought stress fractures were the same as the atypical fractures.
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,460.92,471.0,"So let me make two points, Justice Sotomayor. First, the complete response letter is not a statute that can be read in the same way as a textualist would read a statute."
2018.17-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,477.68,489.04,"But the statutory background basically says the only way that you advise someone to change a label, as I understand it, is if it's minor changes."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,505.48,510.12,I respectfully disagree and I think the United States disagrees that that's how the FDA --
2018.17-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.12,510.76,Doesn't mean they're right.
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,513.28,524.08,"Well, but looking -- looking at the statute, under 355(o)(4)(A), the Secretary has a statutory obligation if it believes a warning is warranted to work with the manufacturer."
2018.17-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,537.96,545.88,"Well, where -- where is the -- in the back and forth, do you have references to atypical stress -- atypical fractures?"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,545.88,575.2,"So the term ""atypical femoral fracture"" is what we're calling today the risk that Respondents are concerned with. That term did not even really begin to be settled upon until a task force report that came out later. But what is clear both in the back and forth and on the face of the complete response letter is that Merck proposed to warn in both the warning and precautions section and the adverse reactions section about low-energy fractures at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft."
2018.17-290,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,632.88,634.44,Counsel -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,634.44,634.92,"No, please."
2018.17-290,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,634.92,681.56,"I think the question that we're all kind of struggling with here seems to me to be this, or something along these lines: Reading the statute your way, do we create a moral hazard that encourages manufacturers to supply the FDA with a lot of information, overwhelming with data, but maybe not the most artfully drafted and maybe deliberately inartfully drafted warning that it thinks is reasonably calculated to be refused, so that it can avoid having to shoulder or bear its own costs of -- of -- internalize its own costs of negligence. What -- what -- what comfort can you give the Court that that's not the -- the outcome of the statutory regime reading that you're proposing?"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,681.56,737.6,"So one comfort that I would give the Court is that the FDA itself, which is -- would be in the position of -- of having the problem that you're describing, doesn't seem concerned about that problem. But the other comfort that I would give you is that we don't dispute that, under the statute, both parties, both the FDA and the manufacturer, have certain responsibilities. We're not trying to absolve the manufacturer of its responsibilities. But, when you have before you an impossibility preemption case where the FDA rejected a proposed warning, the only way to understand the meaning of that rejection and what it means for impossibility is in light of the FDA's part of its obligations. The FDA does have some obligations. And where it is provided with a warning that it understood to be about the relevant risk and rejects that, that necessarily establishes that it was impossible for the manufacturer to simultaneously comply with both what --"
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.6,767.68,"Well, but your -- the way you answered that question, you said a warning that it understood to be about the relevant risk, and -- and that's really the question. The back and forth about the proposal and about the FDA's reaction to it is whether the FDA understood to be -- the warning to be about major fractures, given that your proposal talked, I think, in six different sentences about stress fractures."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,767.68,784.8,"So let me address the stress fracture language because I think that may be causing some of the -- some of the confusion here. The -- the risk that Merck warned about was about these atypical -- I'm sorry, about low-energy fractures at the subtrochanteric region."
2018.17-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,811.84,856.48,"Well, but, if I understand the -- if I understand the sort of terminology, and maybe I don't, but insufficiency stress fractures are, you know, essentially, there's a world of things where you can have a traumatic incident that leads to a fracture and then you can have other fractures that are not caused by trauma, right? But the fractures that are not caused by trauma can be small fractures, stress fractures that take care of themselves with rest and elevation, and large fractures, where all of a sudden you're staring at a bone that's popping out the wrong way. So those are really different things. They're both caused by something that's not trauma, but one is an inconvenience and the other is a serious injury."
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,856.48,868.0,"The serious injury, the complete fracture, is something that begins as what looks like a stress fracture and can progress to completion."
2018.17-290,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,900.88,913.2,"If -- if we read your -- the letters to refer to stress fractures as something -- and not atypical fractures, could you still win this case?"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,913.2,944.08,"We could because, regardless of how you read the letters, the FDA has told us in this Court and has all -- and all of the FDA's actions in connection with this -- with this area show that it understood what we were talking about. And the one additional piece of evidence that I would point to that I haven't identified to this point, in March 2010, months after the FDA issued its complete response letter, it made a public safety announcement saying that it was continuing to study this issue of atypical femoral fractures."
2018.17-290,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,967.0,984.36,"What do we do about the fact that under the regulations Merck could have filed a CBE at any time? Does that pose a problem for you, at least after, say, the -- the March investigation starts?"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,984.36,986.64,It -- it -- that doesn't pose a problem for us.
2018.17-290,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1003.76,1020.72,"Perhaps I'll spot you that with respect to -- for purposes of this question before the March 2010 letter, but what about after that? Once it starts launching an investigation into the product, the task force period, what do we do about that period?"
2018.17-290,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1020.72,1027.24,"Well, I think the point, though, is that in March 2010, what the FDA said is that it was waiting on the task force report."
2018.17-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1049.08,1055.0,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1055.0,1145.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by addressing an issue that both Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch have touched on, and I think it's important to distinguish between two potential types of confusion. The first is that, in October of 2010, when the FDA ultimately decided that an addition to the warnings and precautions section of these labels was warranted, it rejected Merck's proposal that the warning include repeated uses of the term ""stress fracture"". And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so. At page 670 of the Joint Appendix, Merck kind of, in the introductory section of its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the warning that it's proposing to add, and it says at the very top of the page: Merck is proposing to add language to both the precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing experience section of the label to describe low-energy fractures that have been reported, of which some have been stress insufficiency at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft."
2018.17-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1145.56,1147.08,I'm sorry. What page is that again?
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1147.08,1149.64,Page 670 of the Joint Appendix.
2018.17-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1149.64,1149.92,Thank you.
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1149.92,1193.96,"And so Merck was making clear that the language it was proposing to add both to the warnings and precaution section and the adverse reactions section proposed to address the same risk. And, indeed, the language that it proposed to add to the adverse reactions section included a cross-reference to the proposed warnings and precaution section, again, reinforcing this. The second thing I'd like to point out in that regard is what my colleague was referring to as the -- Merck's own explanation for its use of the term ""stress fracture"". Merck explained at page 746 of the Joint Appendix in its proposal that it was using the term as an umbrella term to refer to fractures that could be partial or complete."
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1222.48,1268.08,"But how are we to understand, Mr. Stewart, like what FDA understands at any given moment? In other words, what are we to look to when we decide whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label? Because one easy way of thinking about whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label is to say: Did the FDA tell Merck that it couldn't change its label in the relevant way? If the FDA told Merck that, then it's impossible. But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, then it's not impossible for Merck to change its label, and it has responsibility over its label, and to the extent that it thinks that the literature supports a change, it should change its label."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1268.08,1270.72,"Well, let me say two or three things about that."
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1293.4,1293.64,Right.
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1297.12,1297.56,Exactly.
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1297.56,1301.24,"Or maybe we would, but it would be an easy case, Merck would win?"
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1301.24,1301.8,Right.
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.6,1314.76,Why?
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1314.76,1315.72,-- subsequent actions.
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1315.72,1319.36,Why? Merck is a manufacturer of a drug.
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1351.16,1351.6,"Well, for --"
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1351.6,1394.84,"Until the FDA says no, if you're a manufacturer who understands there's a serious risk to a drug, shouldn't you continue to try everything possible, including making the corrections that you were told to make, including doing what the task force did, telling the FDA you're wrong? Instead, what Merck did was say, I'm absolved, I don't have to make the changes, I don't have to talk to them anymore, I just have to let them -- ""them"" being the FDA -- figure out what to do. Seems to be sort of turning responsibility on its head."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1394.84,1405.64,"Well, as you say, an important feature of the statutory and regulatory scheme is that, while the manufacturer has responsibility for its label, it can make changes only with FDA's approval."
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1405.64,1406.36,Not true.
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1412.44,1413.4,That's true.
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1445.12,1459.24,So what happens here to the incentive for manufacturers to continue working expeditiously with the FDA to effect changes when they're necessary?
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1459.24,1483.48,"Well, our -- our point is that if the better reading of the letter, if the better understanding of FDA's intent is that it rejected the proposed addition because it felt that the medical evidence wasn't there, then for -- any preemption regime that would create an incentive for Merck nevertheless to add the warning through the CBE process and wait for FDA to disapprove it would, in our view, be counterproductive."
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1488.72,1489.16,But if I --
2018.17-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1489.16,1505.28,So what would happen if -- if the FDA had said in response -- in the complete response letter the medical evidence is insufficient and then Merck turned around within a short period of time and filed a -- a CBE relating to the same thing? What would the FDA have done?
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1505.28,1507.16,I think it would surely have disapproved it.
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1537.36,1537.96,I -- I take it --
2018.17-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1537.96,1538.04,Could --
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1538.04,1539.72,"-- Mr. Stewart, you're saying two things."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1587.28,1608.08,"I -- I would agree with that with this caveat: That you would expect the -- the letter -- given that the documentation in Merck's submission included a lot of information about the more serious type of fracture, even if FDA was concerned about the wording of the label, you would expect it to express a view one way or the other as to whether there was sufficient evidence of causation."
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1608.08,1609.32,"It -- it doesn't know yet, let's assume."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1632.44,1660.52,"I guess, if FDA had said that unambiguously, it wouldn't trigger impossibility, but it seems very unlikely and really inconsistent with the statutory and regulatory scheme to suppose that FDA would do that, that it would receive a submission about the risks of these more serious fractures and yet would make no determination, even if -- in its own mind as to whether that risk was sufficiently severe, whether the evidence of causation was sufficient to warrant an additional warning."
2018.17-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1660.52,1683.16,"Wait, I guess you're changing my -- my -- you know, I meant this to be a hypothetical, where you could assume a hypothetical on both sides, right, where the language was sufficiently clear of what FDA was doing, that it either would or wouldn't take Merck off the hook. My real question for you is suppose we're not at either one of those worlds. Suppose we have an ambiguous letter."
2018.17-290,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1686.88,1709.28,"I think the Court ultimately should construe it but should construe it in light of the statutory and regulatory scheme, which would have compelled FDA to initiate the process for changing the label if it had determined that the evidence of causation was sufficient to support an addition of some warning to the warnings and precaution section."
2018.17-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.28,1721.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1721.76,1732.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that brand-name drug makers are responsible at all times for keeping their labels up to date."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1820.36,1835.28,"Well, is it your argument now that -- that Merck is -- Merck became liable at some point after the issuance of the complete response letter or on the day after the issuance of the complete response letter?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1835.28,1847.04,"Our position, Your Honor, is that the complete response letter in a sense doesn't affect the underlying duties at all because the -- the warning that was proposed was an inadequate warning."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1847.04,1866.52,"What if -- but what if the -- the FDA had said the wording of your -- of your warning is bad because this term ""stress fracture"" is misleading, but beyond that, the data does not support any warning relating to low-energy femoral fractures?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1866.52,1870.72,I think it's important to keep in mind what the regulatory duty of the agency's --
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1870.72,1871.24,"Well, what would --"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1871.24,1909.92,"The answer to that is that it -- that likely points stronger in the direction of preemption, but please look at Section 314.110(a)(1) of the regulations because that regulation tells the FDA in its complete response letter you have to give a full answer, a full justification because that's part of the back and forth, the give and take with the manufacturer. And so, Justice Gorsuch, to your question about the moral hazard, it's not just if the manufacturer deliberately misleads the FDA by putting in."
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1940.32,1956.4,"Well, Mr. Frederick, let -- let's say I buy at least part of what you're selling, for purposes of this question, that the complete response letter and, what is it, 355(o)(4) --"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1956.4,1956.56,(I).
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1956.56,1979.8,"-- doesn't -- thank you -- doesn't completely answer our question. We have, though, the March 2010 safety statement from the FDA which pretty clearly says that they do not think that there is science enough to support a causal link between the drug and atypical femoral fractures."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1994.48,2006.4,"Again, we're getting into the agency musings of the type that Justice Thomas very eloquently wrote about in Wyeth versus Levine, which is it is not impossible for the manufacturer to have done the right thing."
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2007.96,2015.0,"Well, you and I will not dispute the elegance of Justice Thomas's opinion in Wyeth. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2015.0,2021.68,But I'm not sure that helps me very much. (Laughter.)
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2021.68,2039.6,"And -- and in all seriousness, if -- if there's some ambiguity about the warning letter, about the complete response letter, isn't that resolved by the FDA's own statement against interest, perhaps, months later, why doesn't that tell us exactly what it was up to?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2039.6,2041.08,Because the standard is lower.
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2086.48,2095.32,"Well, and that's why it set up the task force at the same time to go study the issue, and it said up to that point we don't have enough, but we're going to go study it."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2095.32,2095.88,And --
2018.17-290,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2095.88,2101.76,"And so why isn't that -- tell us everything we need to know about what its complete response letter was about, as a matter of law?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2101.76,2107.64,"Because, Justice -- Justice -- Justice Gorsuch, that's the whole point of impossibility preemption."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2138.6,2144.52,"Well, that's not really -- I mean, are you really serious about that argument? What would be preemptive is not the letter."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2164.64,2170.0,"Justice Alito, we know the answer when Merck proposes an inadequate warning."
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.28,2181.96,Why don't we? I -- I think that was Justice Gorsuch's --
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2181.96,2188.8,"And the reason why we don't, and, again, I'm going to go back to Dr. Lane, we have nothing in this about the duration of --"

2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2193.92,2196.2,The response letter is at page 511 --
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.2,2197.72,"Well done, well done."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2197.72,2200.32,"-- of the Joint Appendix, 511 to 512."
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.32,2201.48,Thank you very much. Okay.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2209.56,2220.08,"What Dr. Lane explains is that an atypical femoral fracture may have an origination as a stress fracture, but it sort of goes off in a completely different direction."
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.08,2221.76,That's all right. But okay.
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2235.32,2237.16,"Well, it's also too narrow."
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.16,2251.0,"A stress fracture, I thought, from what you just said, that those words used in Merck's application are too broad because it is a subset of those."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2252.52,2253.56,It's inaccurate.
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.08,2254.52,"Well, but is it --"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2254.52,2256.24,-- and too narrow. That's the problem.
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.68,2261.52,"That's very, very diplomatic. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.52,2264.52,But this is my actual -- where I -- where I'm leading.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2264.52,2264.76,No --
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.76,2271.92,"I'm leading to this, that, when you talk about the standard, drugs are important to people."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2371.88,2372.2,Yes.
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.2,2375.52,-- somewhat specific but more abstract question.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2377.44,2380.0,Let's -- let's not look at what the lawyers knew.
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.64,2433.8,"I understood these -- Mr. Stewart to say it is a particular type of fracture, it's a particular type of stress fracture, and that the FDA understood the use of that term to be broad enough to include the atypical fractures as well."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2433.8,2435.48,That's not accurate.
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.48,2436.56,That's not what he said?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2436.56,2440.4,"I don't know if that's what he said, but we would dispute whether that's correct."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2455.8,2460.4,"But you -- you -- you agree that the question is what the FDA understood, right?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2460.4,2490.6,"I think that that question comes second, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice. The first question is, what did the manufacturer know or should have known at a particular point in time? And then the next question is, what did the FDA understand about that? Because, if you take the statute that I started my argument with, it's always on the manufacturer to stay up to date. Remember, the manufacturer has superior information about these drugs to the FDA."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2506.32,2510.08,"Well, but what we're talking about is what -- what they told the FDA, what the FDA understood."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2533.2,2553.44,"And, Mr. Chief Justice, as a matter of preemption law where we're invoking the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution to say that federal law is going to displace state law, we shouldn't be engaging in some musings or some interpretation about a low-level civil servant at the FDA and what that --"
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.44,2554.76,They're not low-level civil servants.
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.76,2556.52,I -- I don't understand your response.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2573.2,2576.96,So I'll read to you from page 515 of the Joint Appendix.
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.96,2655.24,Could you --
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2655.24,2655.88,The thing -- what Mr. --
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2655.88,2657.0,-- made the decision to --
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2657.0,2657.44,I'm sorry.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2657.68,2661.48,That's why Congress made the decision to keep the manufacturer at all times.
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2661.48,2691.6,"What Mr. Stewart cited was page 746 of the Joint Appendix, where Merck defines a stress fracture in this way: ""A stress fracture (also known as an insufficiency fracture) is defined as a partial or complete fracture occurring with either normal or increased activity but without an identifiable external traumatic event."" Now does not that encompass a -- the type of fracture that you're talking about?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2691.6,2692.28,Not really.
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2692.28,2694.0,"Well, it says ""or complete."""
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2694.0,2695.04,"It does, Justice Alito."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2714.48,2721.8,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but this is what -- you know, in very simple terms, this is what troubles me about your argument."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2789.16,2789.24,"And, Justice --"
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2789.24,2790.12,That's what troubles me --
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2790.12,2790.48,"Yeah, and --"
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2790.48,2790.84,-- about your argument.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2790.84,2817.68,"Well, Justice Alito, if you look further into the record of what happened here, there's an April 2009 email chain between the FDA and Merck in which FDA says it wants to ""work with Merck on precautions language"" if it is warranted. It's still trying to understand, because these are a specialized, highly unique set of injuries here."
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2817.68,2817.8,Right.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2881.68,2890.12,"The manufacturer should continue to study the problem, should continue to provide information to the FDA."
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2890.12,2892.92,Should the manufacturer change the label?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2892.92,2893.68,Possibly.
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2914.16,2914.68,True.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2961.28,2962.16,Right.
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.16,2973.12,-- that they thought that it is more dangerous to put the label -- to put the risk in the label than it is to leave it out.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2973.12,2973.8,And --
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2973.8,2976.08,And then they set up a task force and decide they were wrong.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2976.08,2990.68,"And here's -- here -- this is a really interesting thing about the task force: The FDA clearly didn't have all -- all of the relevant information, because what the task force finds is that there are about 170 some articles that had been written on this subject."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3040.28,3062.68,"What if you had a situation where, in light of the exchanges you've talked about, Merck goes ahead and puts on its label, oh, and, by the way, you should be very careful about these atypical femoral fractures, not -- not -- and it turns out that doctors say, well, gosh, if that's going to happen, I'm not going to prescribe Fosamax."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3083.08,3101.4,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, the answer is that the manufacturer's always responsible for its label, but the over-warning problem is one where the FDA is balancing these risks and benefits at all times. And, here, we know that wasn't a problem."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.4,3104.64,"Well, no, I know you're changing the hypothetical."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3104.64,3105.36,"No, but --"
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3105.36,3107.04,"Your point, I -- well, maybe I don't know."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3118.56,3121.72,"Well, there has to be an injury that comes from the over-warning."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3121.72,3132.56,The injury is that doctors are not prescribing Fosamax to women who would benefit from it and they're not prescribing it because Merck put in a warning that the FDA would determine was over-warning.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3132.56,3136.8,"Not -- Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, there's not a state law tort there."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.6,3146.2,The injury is the physician decides not to prescribe Fosamax to a woman who would benefit from it.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3146.2,3146.6,Right.
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3149.4,3150.56,So -- so it's a tort --
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3150.56,3156.76,"There's no -- there's no state law there that says there's negligence in that circumstance, Your Honor."
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.76,3171.44,"Well, I thought that -- I thought the logic would be the same as your logic here, is that the label turned out to be misleading because of the drug manufacturer's decision about what to include, which they should have included even though it's not required by the FDA."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3173.36,3180.12,"But my point here, Mr. Chief Justice, and let's go with a hypothetical that the FDA had actually accepted this."
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3209.6,3246.48,"Mr. Frederick, let's be -- coming down to practical, okay? You say earlier that the Merck scientists were saying, when they received this letter, the FDA doesn't like our language. What do you suggest Merck could have done without changing its label until the FDA would have approved it? And why do you believe that you can convince a jury that, if they had done it your way, the FDA would have accepted the new label?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3246.48,3249.32,"Well, as a regulatory matter, let's start with the law first."
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3260.52,3269.44,"Well, we know that the FDA -- assuming the theory that the FDA doesn't believe the label is adequate, what could they have done --"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3269.44,3270.4,They could --
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3270.4,3272.88,-- absent the study?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3272.88,3273.72,They --
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3273.72,3280.08,"Meaning because the study obviously changed the FDA's mind. You're saying, you, Merck, could have done it."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3280.08,3280.4,Yes.
2018.17-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3293.88,3298.28,And that wasn't communicated by Merck to the FDA? Is that what you're saying?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3298.28,3298.8,Yes.
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3329.4,3333.28,"Mr. Frederick, you want us to affirm the decision of the Third Circuit?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3333.28,3340.08,"You should affirm the judgment because the judgment was correct, summary judgment for Merck was not warranted."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3340.08,3340.52,Uh-huh.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3349.0,3350.52,We take the position --
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3350.52,3361.76,-- based on that Merck would have to prove to a jury by clear and convincing evidence that the FDA would not have approved an appropriate warning?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3361.76,3373.48,"We agree with Merck that, because of the complete response letter back and forth, we -- we think that that -- and we argued this, I argued this in the Third Circuit, was a legal document that a judge can interpret."
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3378.48,3385.76,"So -- so are you saying that you think that the question is, was there official action by the FDA that prevented Merck from changing its label?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3385.76,3388.36,And the answer to --
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3388.36,3395.36,Is that the test in your view? Is there official action by the FDA that prevented Merck from changing its label?
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3395.36,3406.04,"To make an adequate warning, that's important, Justice Kagan, because the warning that the FDA has to reject has to be adequate to address the risks under state law."
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3406.04,3406.24,Correct.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3410.28,3413.0,"It is a legal question, but it has factual components."
2018.17-290,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3413.0,3414.72,But a judge can decide that question.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3414.72,3426.16,"A judge can decide the core legal question, but in all constitutional questions, there are usually fact issues, and we consign those to juries to decide what the fact issues --"
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3426.16,3427.2,Not always.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3439.76,3440.12,As I said --
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3440.12,3448.32,It seems to me that this is in that number because it's predominantly a legal question and there could be factual disputes on the brute facts.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3449.96,3464.52,"I think that the one disputed fact here that has sort of surfaced as a result of the argument today is, what does the phrase ""low energy"" mean? Merck and SG have taken the position that ""low energy"" encompasses atypical femoral fractures."
2018.17-290,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3479.4,3490.96,"I believe they do, but, normally, there's a factor, there are a set of factors classically when it's a mixed question of fact and law, and one of the factors is sometimes who will do it better, at least as I interpret it."
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3490.96,3493.36,"And, as I say, we -- we briefed the case."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3520.76,3521.76,I'm confused.
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3533.72,3538.36,Merck was not entitled to summary judgment.
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3538.36,3548.96,"Yeah, but you want to alter the judgment of the Third Circuit by saying that it was -- it was wrong in -- in saying this should be submitted to a jury, that it's a factual question to be submitted to a jury?"
2018.17-290,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3548.96,3552.04,"As I say, I think there are fact questions here."
2018.17-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3597.44,3598.92,So you want us --
2018.17-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3598.92,3599.56,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-290,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3606.2,3617.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If the FDA does not know yet whether a warning is justified or not, that means no, the manufacturer in that situation can't change the label."
2018.17-290,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3628.88,3651.12,How about the manufacturer's duty to work with the FDA to ensure that the label is right and that it has all pertinent information to reconsider its initial decision? Mr. Frederick said there were only five of 170 articles provided to the FDA.
2018.17-290,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3673.56,3674.36,Justice --
2018.17-290,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3674.36,3675.68,Isn't that your burden?
2018.17-290,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3675.68,3679.36,"Justice Sotomayor, the process that you're describing is exactly what happened here."
2018.17-290,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3679.36,3680.48,It didn't.
2018.17-290,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3685.76,3697.56,"Justice Sotomayor, the PAS submission included 132 studies about the risk that Respondents say we should have warned about, the very same studies that Respondents themselves rely on that."
2018.17-290,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3796.68,3797.68,"Thank you, counsel."
