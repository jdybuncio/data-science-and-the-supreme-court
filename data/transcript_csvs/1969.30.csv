1969.30,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.435,"arter against the Jury Commission of Greene County, Alabama."
1969.30,0,36990,norman_c_amaker,,12.143,14.641,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.30,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1213.676,1231.686,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I think I should first address myself to a little problem that came up yesterday afternoon, and that was in the Georgia case."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,1913.096,1921.487,"Mr. Chief Justice, in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's inquiry as to what occurred."
1969.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.007,1964.076,"There are racial designations on the list, are there?"
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,1964.076,1965.129,They were required on --
1969.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1965.129,1965.653,On accord with the --
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,1965.653,1967.36,"Yes, yes they are."
1969.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.518,1992.27,"Well, in the absence of some particularized reason, I suppose the complaint to be made of the fact that there -- were racial designations."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,1992.27,1996.553,"Well, I think that the particularized reason appear from these records, you see."
1969.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.553,1997.592,Right.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2000.41,2021.725,"But that has been -- that was the same thing that Congress did you know, in the Jury Act, and in both the Jury Bills because the problem we've had in these racial discrimination cases over the years, Mr. Justice Stewart, is that you haven't been able to find out very often or at least not without you'd been able to would not about considerable amount of difficulty what the racial breakdown was."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2034.618,2043.288,"May I ask you, are you familiar with -- in the last election, how many colored people were elected to county office?"
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2043.288,2044.393,The very last one --
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2044.393,2045.458,In Greene County.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2045.458,2046.32,In Greene County?
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2046.32,2049.228,Yes.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2049.228,2051.424,There were at least three or four.
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2053.886,2056.623,Yes.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2056.623,2057.128,There were --
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2057.128,2060.118,"Now, in serving now."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2060.118,2061.659,"There are about three or four, I --"
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2061.659,2063.353,What offices are they?
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2063.353,2068.841,I'm not entirely sure what the offices are Mr. Justice Black.
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.524,2081.745,"As I recall it, there were some of the key officers of the county."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2093.197,2095.734,"There were some blacks elected, yes."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2100.497,2104.192,Of course because it had not been that way before.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2114.741,2118.417,"Well that was true in that voting context, and that's really the cognitive."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.79,2124.448,Yes.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2124.448,2136.002,"That, you know, the Civil Rights Commission's Report documented the alienation of blacks in -- throughout the south generally in Alabama and Greene County particularly."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.066,2160.712,Now the Court have black people as bonus.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2160.712,2160.926,Oh!
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2169.518,2191.068,"We must recall that if they could -- if we could take out of the State its power to select its officials in anyway they choose either by election or by appointment that that would cut against either one when become rules, wouldn't it?"
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2191.068,2191.219,Oh!
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2191.488,2195.39,Say the courts could take the power instead of the legislative branch.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2195.39,2200.635,"No, but I'm not -- the submission is not nearly that broad Mr. Justice Black."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.817,2202.907,I understand it is a --
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2202.907,2203.395,Pardon me?
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2203.395,2218.419,"It is a rather unique thing to suggest that the courts of the nation have a right to change the legislation in a state and say that instead of having appointments, they should have election."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2224.863,2233.219,"Well, I think it has occurred on occasions and it has occurred and the decisions of this Court reflect those occasions."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2253.779,2253.965,That's right.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2253.965,2256.468,"The last -- and that's one example, that was unique."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2256.468,2272.4,"Yes, but that's not an example is it of changing the law in reference to selection of officers saying how this shall be selected invalidating the law which provides to appointment of certain people."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2272.4,2283.342,I don't see that as an invalidation of the law because I see that only as a remedial aspect of the court's equity powers once you have a demonstrated constitutional violation.
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2283.342,2291.934,[Voice Overlap] get away from rules and semantics because here we are up against a real practical situation.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2303.761,2305.08,"Well, I don't -- no, I don't see that --"
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2305.08,2306.227,That's through the core?
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2306.227,2308.063,It's not an election law and --
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2308.063,2314.299,"But it's an election law that he shall appoint, I mean it's a selection of officers that he shall appoint."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2314.299,2333.601,"But when I addressed the question of how do you deal with this terribly intractable problem of racial discrimination when the Governor has consistently appointed only white jury commissioners, and those jury commissioners has consistently discriminated against blacks, I think our Constitution can reach that."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2341.882,2345.064,But why wouldn't it invalidate it?
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2345.064,2364.899,"I think if the invalidation occurs, Mr. Justice Black, it occurs only to in those to use your term, unique situations in which it is clearly demonstrated as it is in this case that this kind of wide ranging deep seeded discrimination has occurred."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2403.986,2406.157,"But -- things to have, that I recall."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2406.157,2406.921,Pardon me?
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2406.921,2428.78,I do not recall doing to this extent its essential vote to the as much to your people as it is to the white people that we preserve ancient landmarks for the Government and not depart completely from the idea if they can elect their officials or appoint them in the manner of the right on law.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2471.564,2474.838,They haven't made that progress without a concerted judicial effort.
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2474.838,2475.302,That's right.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2475.302,2477.695,Litigation after litigation after litigation.
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2477.695,2478.478,That's right but I don't --
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2478.478,2479.094,And this case is entirely --
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.094,2486.469,I don't condole that we took away from that state its right to appoint jury commissions.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2486.469,2486.98,"Well, if that --"
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.98,2494.177,"And as demanded it to be a Governor appoint a man of a certain title, (inaudible) a jury commission."
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2494.177,2501.301,"Well, it certainly seems that just as the majority of the citizens in Greene County are entitled to elect the persons that they choose."
1969.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2513.449,2521.143,No one can disagree with you I don't think who lives in the fair and equal government on that basis that they are entitled to.
1969.30,2,36990,norman_c_amaker,,2592.276,2593.878,"My time is up, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.30,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.405,2606.058,Thank you Mr. Amaker.
