1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-656, Ralph Munro, Secretary of State of Washington, versus Socialist Workers Party."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,63.99,79.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the State of Washington has a uniquely open election system, a system unusually hospitable to new and minor parties and independents and their candidates."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.516,208.401,"Subsidizing meaning printing, including their name on the ballot?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,208.401,211.937,"--There's more than that in the State of Washington, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,235.052,238.904,Is that kind of information disseminated in connection with the primary as well as the general election?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,238.904,240.106,"It is not, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.771,404.39,"Sixty-five candidates for what, Mr. Johnson?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,404.39,409.461,"--Sixty-five candidates for statewide and Congressional races, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.461,411.344,So those were not just local races.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,411.344,412.829,"That does not include local races, no."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.694,439.396,How many candidates were there for Governor?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,439.396,450.935,"--There were eight candidates for Governor, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and a good example of showing that the candidates, the non... the minor party independents did not attract any substantial support."
1986.85-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.185,501.887,"Well, of course, that could be remedied by not printing them."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,501.887,510.325,"--Yes, but much to the detriment of the voting system, at least in the judgment of the legislature and the citizens of Washington, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.86,517.246,I don't think it is something to keep emphasizing.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,518.996,526.168,"--Justice Marshall, as in Buckley v. Valeo, I think the public is not obligated to undertake public financing of elections."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.143,544.547,"Mr. Johnson, I feel bound to inform you that there is no word in the English language ""irregardless""."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,545.999,546.916,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.428,621.98,"And of course it is 5 percent of something different, isn't it?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,621.98,627.534,"No, the 5 percent before, Justice Stevens, was also applied to the primary vote."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.534,629.101,"I thought it was... oh, I see."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,629.101,631.818,This was in the Washington system before the legislative change.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.818,635.454,The 5 percent was required for the major party candidate to got on the ballot?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,635.454,635.672,It was.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.524,640.841,"Of course, that would never happen, I don't suppose."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,640.841,643.143,--The record here does not show that.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.143,648.197,Does the record contain examples of this pamphlet you describe as being sent out to the voters?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,648.197,651.416,"I don't believe there is such in the record, Your Honor."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.416,652.649,Is there any reference to it at all in the record?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,652.649,656.553,There is reference in the legislative history.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.553,658.02,"No, I mean in the record before us."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,658.02,659.505,I think there is not.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.505,662.124,So you have just told us about it for the first time?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,662.124,662.674,Pardon?
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.757,667.076,Yet this was one of the major things they were saving in enacting this statute?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,667.076,672.729,"--I think it is in the legislative history, A, Justice Stevens, and it is a statutory requirement of which I think the Court can take judicial knowledge."
1986.85-656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.251,695.611,Could you tell me why it is that in running in this primary the independent and small party candidates are not really running in the primary?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,711.455,725.447,"Justice Scalia, I do not understand... first, the nominating convention requirement was not challenged below, nor do I understand the party here to object or to prefer primary nomination for its candidates."
1986.85-656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,739.588,740.005,I see.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,740.005,744.325,"I think, but Mr. Smith may best address whether this is preferred by the party."
1986.85-656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.325,746.526,I am still curious as to the reason for it.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,754.864,757.799,The legislative record does not show that.
1986.85-656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.799,761.953,You don't have any guess as to what it was--
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,761.953,785.736,"Printed as A1 in our reply brief, in that appendix the legislative memorandum mentions the question of minor parties being allowed to not control their own candidates and convention, which suggests to me the argument I have just advanced, that what was intended was to let them at the smaller stage not have the general election... the major parties in Washington sometimes object to the primary system we have, which allows all voters to determine a party's nominees."
1986.85-656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.889,799.411,"--But you understand that one of the arguments being made here is that since there are not two candidates competing, why would you expect voters to come out to vote for their--"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,799.411,803.53,"I do understand that, and I think, Justice Scalia, the answer in part is the Washington system."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.131,861.45,--What did they give up?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,862.066,867.604,"--In the old system, Justice Stevens, you had to go to the convention the same day as the primary and could not vote in the primary."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.604,872.138,You mean the person who was a delegate to the convention couldn't vote?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,872.138,872.438,Yes.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.438,873.788,Why couldn't he?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,876.64,877.406,The statute prohibited it.
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.406,877.956,"Oh, I see."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,882.644,885.996,"There are lots of other issues on the primary, Justice Stevens, than this nomination."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.996,886.496,"--Oh, I see."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,886.496,893.684,"Typically a small party, and this case has several examples, only nominates for a couple of races."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.184,897.902,But you have other issues like bond issues and things like that on your primary ballot?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,897.902,906.408,--And you can go to the primary and vote for the Socialist Workers' candidate for Governor or legislator and also vote for the other party--
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.408,915.514,"It occurs to me that the 1 percent requirement could be quite different in an election which had, say there was no contest for the Democratic nomination and no contest for the Republican nomination."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,923.537,925.254,"--Justice Stevens, it depends on the position."
1986.85-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.922,928.322,It depends on what the issues are at the primary election.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,928.322,928.872,--And the position.
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.377,1118.864,"Why, then, do you suppose the minor parties have had such bad luck under this new law?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1118.864,1122.999,"--There are three reasons, and by the way--"
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.999,1125.351,"That is true, isn't it?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1129.887,1136.492,"--Justice White, I think the Ninth Circuit says that, and I think they are applying the wrong historical analysis."
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.566,1159.774,"To the extent their analysis... they should have looked more broadly, but their narrow look was correct?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1159.774,1166.695,"The statistics were correct, with the exception that they were numerically wrong about independents."
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.38,1172.38,You mean since the law was changed?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1172.38,1173.213,Since the law was changed.
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.473,1203.351,I wasn't suggesting that the experience of the... that the state had to allow the same access to the general ballot as they had had before this new law.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1203.351,1205.034,Then it is a slight reduction.
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.034,1206.7,The question is whether this new law is constitutional.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1206.7,1214.806,"Yes, Justice Stevens, but I think what we are looking for in the historical material is... we are analyzing for the rights of the voters so we are--"
1986.85-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.806,1216.842,I feel obligated to tell you that my name is White.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1216.842,1217.742,--I am sorry.
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.677,1257.783,Maybe the Socialist Workers Party position would be that the issues that are alive and well and being debated in Washington aren't the ones we want to debate.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1262.901,1264.62,--And we think that is very important.
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1292.004,1296.158,Where did they get their votes from in King County and Takoma?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1296.158,1304.828,"I think they have conceded in their brief this party has its major... if there is a base of adherence, is in Seattle-Takoma metropolitan area."
1986.85-656,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1366.301,1370.336,"Mr. Johnson, what is the state interest you rely on?"
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1370.336,1382.061,"Primarily what this state, this Court has conceded the state's interest in requiring a showing of substantial support before a candidate appears on the ballot."
1986.85-656,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1395.951,1402.438,So you rely only on a purpose of the state of requiring substantial support.
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1402.438,1403.474,And that purpose serves two--
1986.85-656,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1403.474,1404.474,And what underlies that?
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1404.474,1406.157,--That purpose serves two interests.
1986.85-656,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.782,1424.702,"Well, under your system the ballot is so long and complicated already that that might not be a very persuasive argument."
1986.85-656,0,31104,james_m_johnson,,1426.07,1433.993,"--It was a persuasive argument to the Washington legislature, Justice O'Connor, and I think they have a right under this Court's decision to respond to that."
1986.85-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.442,1565.128,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1568.013,1584.339,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, when we analyzed state restrictions on political expression and association relating to minor parties with dissident views, we are operating in the core of the First Amendment."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.83,1725.615,"You are referring now, Mr. Smith, to the statutory requirements for the convention?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1725.615,1726.484,--Correct.
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.484,1728.1,What are those?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1728.1,1761.823,"The convention requires that on the Saturday before the major parties even have to declare their candidacy, the minor party has to gather supporters on one day in one places nominate its candidates, and have a nominating petition signed by a number, which is now on a sliding scaler according to population, approximately 200 at this time, registered voters who give their names and voting addresses attesting to the nomination of that candidate."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.823,1765.109,That means that 200 registered voters would have to attend the convention?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1765.109,1766.542,That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.341,1827.495,You are saying what it now takes is 200 people in a convention.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1827.495,1828.028,In a convention.
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.028,1828.611,That is for a party.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1828.611,1829.211,That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.211,1832.613,What if you want to run without party support?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1832.613,1836.101,As an independent it is the same requirement for a similar convention.
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.789,1853.157,"Well, now, if this were the only requirement to get on the general election ballot you wouldn't be challenging it, would you?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,1853.157,1867.084,"That's correct, and we believe that the record shows that historically a reasonable but small number of serious minor parties have been able to qualify, and since this has been adopted have still been able to nominate candidates."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.138,1977.924,"Mr. Smith, is that relevant?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2015.597,2046.901,"Well, with regard to the first question you ask, Justice Scalla, whether it is too latitudinarian, this Court has said that one of the first things we can look at is whether in practice as applied minor parties are able to qualify, and the Court has said it is one thing if minor parties are regularly able to qualify for the ballot, and it is quite another thing if only rarely can any minor party get on."
1986.85-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.407,2087.145,"Mr. Smith, would you accept any number?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2092.097,2117.414,"--Yes, we believe that the fact that serious minor parties have been regularly able to meet the nominating convention requirement would be adequate support for that requirement to withstand any attack by somebody else who was not able to meet it to say the fact that these small but serious minor parties are able to meet this requirement indicates it is fair."
1986.85-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.414,2124.484,So if somebody has a convention of 200 relatives they can get on the ballot?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2124.484,2151.486,"The historical record indicates that that is not a problem, that has never happened in the State of Washington, and that there is no support on the record for the fear that that might happen, especially not if the remedy for such a hypothetical fear should be such areal and drastic and devastating impact on the few minor parties who need this route to the ballot."
1986.85-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.486,2160.424,"Well, do you think a person could during 20 years of his life run every two years and get less than ten votes?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2160.424,2167.513,Pardon me?
1986.85-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.513,2168.747,You don't understand the question?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2184.59,2198.349,"Well, I believe if the state wants to let people on without mounting the substantial effort that the convention requires, that the state may make that choice to open its ballot to those kinds of candidates, but--"
1986.85-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.349,2200.166,Is it obliged to?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2200.166,2202.468,--We are not suggesting that it is obliged to.
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.513,2230.988,"Well, Mr. Smith, in your definition of serious minor party when you were replying to Justice Marshall's question, I gather there is a numerical component to seriousness."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2244.378,2257.471,"Well, the hypothetical question is not posed in this case because we have a real situation in which there is a real and substantial requirement to qualify."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.446,2278.301,But it seems to me part of your argument is that our cases have said that there must be a way for serious minor parties to get on the ballot.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2278.301,2278.951,That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.951,2287.907,"And I am curious to know whether the way you use that term the term ""serious"" can at least be construed by the state to have a numerical component."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2298.715,2323.497,"Well, it depends on what the requirement is, because the numerical requirements for petition signatures, which are the only requirements that have been upheld by this Court, do represent some level of organizational ability and diligence that the party itself can control and go out and get signatures on the petitions, in Jenness, for example."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.5,2458.084,Excuse me.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2475.546,2497.042,"I think that is probably correct if the state's interest that it is asserting against Socrates is that the voters would be confused and the ballot would be crowded, and the Democrats and Republicans say you cannot be the third candidate on our ballot because that would confuse the voters and crowd the ballot, I think Socrates should win in that case."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.042,2498.744,Even if he has no support whatever.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2502.029,2503.565,That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.565,2510.969,What about the many expressions in our cases that in fact the state can require that the people it puts on its ballots have substantial support?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2515.623,2537.453,"That is because of the experience that with no requirement whatsoever substantial... some modicum of support is a fair requirement to avoid the problems of ballot crowding and voter confusion, and in this case we have such a legitimate interest being taken care of by one mechanism."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.808,2557.2,That can't be the explanation of our cases because a much more... much less restrictive means of preventing confusion is to have a sliding scale of the degree of support you need.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2580.963,2607.095,"Substantial support is not required as an end in itself, Number One, but Number Two, if it is of a reasonably low level that it allows, consistently allows serious minor party candidates to qualify, then the cases say you haven't met the threshold of showing... the first step is showing a substantial impact on diversity."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.095,2610.482,"But I note you have slipped in the word ""serious"", ""serious minor party""."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2621.855,2658.38,"The record in the State of Washington is that there are a small number of minor parties that have regularly qualified candidates for the ballot, like the Socialist Workers Party, like the Libertarian Party, and what the legislative history indicates is that the frivolous parties that were allegedly targeted were ones with no serious program and no solutions to offer the people, and the record indicates that they were specifically irritated by the OWL Party, and unfortunately used an ax when they should have used a scalpel."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.38,2664.284,"Mr. Smith, let me get back again to something I think I asked you previously."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2701.207,2715.632,"I would say if it doesn't let any party... if, like this case, it lets no party outside the Democratic and Republican Party qualify for the ballot, it is clearly unconstitutional if--"
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2715.632,2720.203,What if it let the Socialist Workers Party on but not the Libertarians?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2721.82,2727.29,"--Well, then it would be a harder case than this one is."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.476,2729.392,How would it come out?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2729.392,2734.463,"--Well, whatever the number is, it cannot be zero as a reasonable number."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.463,2735.729,"How would that case come, out?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2743.669,2772.302,"I'd say if another small party could meet a, for example, a petition signature requirement which could be met through reasonable diligence, then it would be constitutional to say your failure to exercise that diligence to gather the relatively reasonable number of signatures that other small parties are able to gathers then you are responsible for your own fate."
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.854,2776.456,May I ask you another question?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2797.536,2811.213,We suggest that it would not for the reasons that I mentioned earlier why the primary election is not an adequate forum for minor parties.
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.213,2823.854,So your position really is that no requirement that depends on an Independent candidacy getting a certain number of votes in the primary would be permissible because the function of a primary is really to sort out the major party candidates?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2823.854,2833.71,"Well, if it was a requirement that was not so high that it--"
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.71,2836.21,"Well, take Justice Marshall's example."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2842.982,2847.617,"--Well, for example, If--"
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.617,2849.136,I have given you the example.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2849.136,2849.686,--Okay.
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.686,2852.921,Would that be permissible?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2852.921,2862.777,"If it had no substantial exclusionary effect on all minor parties, that would be permissible."
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.777,2864.693,"Well, it would exclude all those that couldn't get 200 votes."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2864.693,2875.667,"Well, as a practical matter I think that this is a hypothetical question which does not require answering to decide this case, and it is unlikely to--"
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.667,2881.988,"It does for me, because I am wondering whether you are assuming there is some minimum threshold that could be imposed in a primary."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2894.146,2897.331,--I suggest that the primary should never be--
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.331,2898.866,"Well, should never."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2909.221,2925.35,"--I'd say it is analogous to the cases of the Court on filing fees, that there is a less restrictive alternative of the petition signatures, and therefore if it has a--"
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.35,2926.85,"Well, there is always going to be a less restrictive alternative."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2928.802,2944.662,"--Well, if the state aims that are being accomplished are preserving the integrity of the ballot, then you cannot use a system that heavily burdens the First Amendment."
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.023,2966.158,"If I understand you correctly, the constitutional outcome depends on the empirical results."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2974.747,2975.783,"That's correct, you have to show the--"
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.783,2985.404,"So you could have... this same provision might have... it didn't work in Michigan, I know, but in another state the 1 percent might be okay if three or four parties could meet the requirement."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,2985.404,2986.338,--That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.981,3002.35,Kind of local community standards for elections.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3002.35,3013.306,"--Well, this Court has rejected facial challenges and said, you have to look at the impact on the actual community, and that if a monopoly is the result, that is impermissible."
1986.85-656,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3013.306,3020.562,"Mr. Smith, what is the Washington system as to write-in votes?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3029.833,3062.972,"The Court of Appeals decision interpreted the Washington statute, which says that an unsuccessful minor party... or an unsuccessful primary participant cannot be a write-in candidate to say that the write-in was not available and the Court of Appeals also followed the decisions of this case saying that a write-in vote is not a constitutionally accepted alternative to general election ballot placement."
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.055,3152.898,"Tell me again, you probably stated it before, but tell me why the Socialist Workers Party isn't able to get the requisite votes at the primary."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3152.898,3183.501,"Well, historically the record as pointed out by Mr. Johnson indicates that choosing the 1 percent level, the state has chosen a level that is higher than 90 percent of the minor parties have ever been able to get, even in the general election, so they have chosen a level that is up at the 90th percentile instead of choosing a level from the record that was down at the 50th or--"
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.501,3199.677,"That is... what you say may be correct, but what I asked you is, why haven't the Socialist Party or the other minor parties been able to get the requisite votes at the primary?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3199.677,3217.739,"--Well, first of all, only one-third of the voters even are interested in enough in the primary to participate, and those are typically partisans of one of the major party candidates who care about what the primary is about, namely, which major party candidate will get the nomination."
1986.85-656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.739,3220.274,"Well, that's fine, 1 percent of a smaller number is a smaller number."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3222.126,3223.995,This is not a randomly selected smaller number.
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.529,3235.433,But it is... the one-third are the ones that the major parties make an effort to get out.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3235.433,3236.635,That's correct.
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3236.635,3241.27,"But the Socialist Workers Party surely make an effort to get their partisans out, don't they?"
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3241.27,3264.886,"That's correct, and we are saying that this is not only unfair in its mode but also that it should not be required that voters make a commitment at that primary stage to the Socialist Workers Party candidate to allow a small number of candidates to participate in the general election, and that--"
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.886,3278.045,Why shouldn't you be... why isn't it fair to say if you... why don't you just get out your supporters and hope that they will add up to 1 percent?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3278.045,3297.341,"--Well, the Socialist Workers Party has made that effort, and $1,900 may not be very much, as Mr. Johnson says, but it is a lot of leaflets, and it is certainly not a prime time television ad that goes statewide the way the major parties can put on."
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.341,3302.011,And what is wrong with saying if you can't get your people out you don't get on the ballot?
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3302.011,3316.004,"Well, because the first amendment and the recognized role of minor parties in the election process does not depend on a large measure of support, and the abolitionists, the prohibitionists--"
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.004,3325.693,"I know, but the question is whether the First Amendment requires... forbids a state to require a showing of 1 percent."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3325.693,3353.443,"--And we suggest that if the interest they assert of confusing the voters and having ballot crowding is the justification for a monopoly by the minor parties, then the Court of Appeals was correct in returning Washington to the system that had worked so well for 70 years and saying that monopoly is not justified on the record here by any demonstrated history of ballot crowding and voter confusion, which is the burden of the state to establish."
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.443,3372.191,"I suppose you would also say if Washington said the only minor parties who can get on the next general election is one that got 1 percent of the vote at the last general election, that would be unconstitutional, too."
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3372.191,3377.643,"That would perpetuate the monopoly, especially when there is the reasonable alternative in the convention and petitions."
1986.85-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.643,3379.345,Even though there's a lot of people out at the general election.
1986.85-656,1,21497,daniel_hoyt_smith,,3379.345,3391.835,"Well, because they have been excluded from the general election, there is no way they can get the 1 percent at the general election and it is a closed door for the minor parties."
1986.85-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.835,3393.001,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1986.85-656,2,31104,james_m_johnson,,3396.869,3422.603,"Just a moment, please, to correct an answer I gave Justice Stevens, that consideration of the number of candidates printed in the voters' pamphlet was discussed in the Washington legislature, Justice Stevens, and is reprinted at Page A2 of our reply brief, the note that this effect retroactively analyzed would have been to cut down the number of candidates from 65 to 50 in that printing."
1986.85-656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.757,3434.578,"May I just ask, 65 to 50, are these all statewide candidates?"
1986.85-656,2,31104,james_m_johnson,,3434.578,3436.944,"--No, they are not, as I responded to the first question."
1986.85-656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.944,3439.363,So there is a different pamphlet for each election district?
1986.85-656,2,31104,james_m_johnson,,3439.363,3441.732,There is a different pamphlet by each Congressional District.
1986.85-656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3441.732,3442.782,By each Congressional District.
1986.85-656,2,31104,james_m_johnson,,3442.782,3443.517,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.517,3444.183,I see.
1986.85-656,2,31104,james_m_johnson,,3444.183,3449.504,"In fact, the convention requirement in Washington is the equivalent of a petition."
1986.85-656,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3548.267,3550.635,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
