1975.75-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,423.455,431.922,Did the District Court focus on the procedural Due Process question that became the foundation of Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion?
1975.75-130,0,45935,william_r_quinlan,,431.922,435.481,That was primarily not the thrust of the argument before the District Court.
1975.75-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.413,470.796,There was very much discussion of the question of procedural due process --

1975.75-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.039,472.394,"-- at the District Court level, was it?"

1975.75-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.788,659.168,For the pre-suspension hearing that was claimed.
1975.75-130,0,45935,william_r_quinlan,,660.365,665.443,The contention was that as a matter of constitutional Due Process on the basis of Goss versus Lopez --
1975.75-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.443,670.985,"I understand that, but what would the hearing direct itself to?"
1975.75-130,0,45935,william_r_quinlan,,670.985,672.887,The Court did not answer that question.
1975.75-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.887,678.343,"I did not ask about the Court, about the party, how about the -- the one who is claiming the hearing?"

1975.75-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.269,1805.283,But Ms. Hirshman there is no proviso in the regulation is that you are exempt from it if your self-contained breathing apparatus fits?
1975.75-130,1,34616,linda_r_hirshman,,1805.283,1824.214,"MNow, that really speaks to the fact that of the City -- the petitioner adhered so tenaciously to the fact that the only justification for the regulation was the safe use of the self-contained breathing apparatus and indeed we would go to mitigation, if not to the substantive violation."
1975.75-130,2,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3508.541,3512.251,"Just quickly, Your Honor, I just like to note the two things."
1975.75-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3563.513,3574.171,The second point I gather is that you agree with your -- the counsel -- your adversary counsel that this case is here for decision and should be decided?

1975.75-130,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.641,3593.545,Thank you counsel.
