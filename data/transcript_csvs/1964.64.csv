1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,69.91,71.446,"Again, they obviously can impose the death penalty."
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,71.446,76.361,"Yes, they did in this case assess the penalty of death, that's the penalty in Alabama."

1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,297.454,304.949,"Well, what they do is to summon additional jurors in addition to those who are summoned for the week."
1964.64,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,315.722,322.277,"Well, the statute only provided that -- those compelled to have a special panel, is that still the law there?"

1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,360.615,362.381,"You mean, if they have -- I don't --"
1964.64,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,362.381,379.792,"Would you agree then, they've gone through this process and they seek to select the jurors, a problem comes out (Inaudible) the challenge, if the challenge (Inaudible)?"

1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,398.152,399.589,They begin with 30 or 40.
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,399.589,399.839,That's right.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.839,401.204,And then you reduce it to twelve.
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,401.204,401.463,That's right.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.463,402.753,On a one-to-two basis?
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,402.753,403.942,Yes.
1964.64,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,447.875,456.421,(Inaudible)
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,456.421,457.609,"That's right, yes."
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.507,463.071,Is there interrogation of the jurors by counsel or by the Court?
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,463.071,463.949,By both.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.949,465.185,"Oh, prior to this --"
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,465.185,465.368,Yes.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.368,466.133,-- preemptory striking?
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,466.133,467.4,"That's right, yes."

1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,528.197,528.807,Pardon me?
1964.64,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,528.807,531.582,Do you attack only the petit jury or do you attack the grand jury also?
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,531.582,533.819,We attack the grand jury also.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,638.589,643.095,"But those reasons would be all be for cause, I suppose if you could show --"
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,643.095,643.89,"Yes, but --"
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,643.89,658.243,"But we're talking now about preemptory challenges and I -- that the very word preemptory as well as the history of preemptory challenges indicates that I had thought that the person could be as capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or prejudiced as he wanted to be --"
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,658.243,658.517,Yes.
1964.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.517,659.431,-- in challenging the jury.
1964.64,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,659.431,666.832,"But there are some instances where the Solicitor cannot prove bias, you say."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1561.67,1565.611,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1820.834,1834.87,May I ask you to remind me in telling this (Inaudible) you have a special law in Talladega County with reference to capital cases and how many jurors you'll draw or is it carried by general of state laws?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1834.87,1857.117,Mr. Justice Black the manner of filling the jury roll and filling the jury box is governed by a special statute in Talladega County but the general law in Alabama still applies as far as the selection of the members of the panel of the venire is concerned.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1857.117,1860.207,"Well, you have a capital case, let's say you have a capital case --"
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1860.207,1860.474,"Yes, Your honor."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1860.474,1861.76,-- in Talladega.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1871.862,1879.354,The judges are required to -- normally he has a venire of say of 50 or 60 and then he is required to draw up to a 100.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1879.354,1880.331,"Oh, it is a minimum."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1882.006,1882.714,"That's right, that's great."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1882.714,1884.154,What is the minimum?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1884.154,1886.577,A 100 on a capital case.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1886.577,1888.496,You have to summon and have a 100 juror.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1888.496,1889.017,Yes sir.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1889.017,1890.812,What's the object to that statement?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1890.812,1892.091,I don't know what the object is.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1897.138,1906.382,I suppose the object was you get both parties strike a lot of people so that they can come as near getting a fair jury responsible.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1906.382,1911.077,Well of course we have a lot of people that come in who were exempt for various reasons.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1916.869,1918.551,Well that wasn't the point.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1922.086,1922.806,In a civil case?
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1922.806,1923.57,Yes.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1923.57,1932.727,"Normally about 40, 30 or 40 because in a civil case you strike one for one."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1932.727,1933.559,One for one --
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1933.559,1933.647,Right.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1933.647,1935.599,"We had 24 men, that's the rule as I understand."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1935.599,1936.838,Yes.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1936.838,1940.174,"That's because that's a civil, it's not very important."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1948.06,1951.248,"Well, they usually have maybe 40 to 50"
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.569,1976.951,"-- to get the idea, you do not have a statute to that which relates to the capital cases only which was passed for the expressed service trying to see that there's enough men there so that when you get through striking they could come as near as possible to getting a fair jury."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1976.951,1987.427,"Well now, it has been my experience with that particular thing though sometimes we ran out of a number of people, a lot of them have asked to be excused for various reasons that some of them don't believe in capital punishment."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1988.364,1997.344,"I understand that but is there not a minimum in capital cases that you have to have, is that the statute --"
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1997.344,1998.287,"Not that I know of, no."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1998.287,1999.038,You don't know.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,1999.038,1999.683,"No, sir."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1999.683,2002.787,"Well, there is a larger number though that we have to have."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2002.787,2021.09,"Well, what -- what normally happens in the case and it has been my experience and I've tried them in various places in Alabama is when you run down to say about 40 then the judge goes out and has the sheriff, summons people from around the courthouse and from around the business."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2021.09,2024.616,You do need to start with more juries in the capital case and other cases?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2024.616,2025.951,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.951,2028.975,I thought in your statement you started with a minimum of 100?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2028.975,2031.83,"Well that's what they normally summons, yes sir."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2046.226,2048.322,And that excuses although it's --
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2048.322,2048.904,Yes.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2048.904,2051.475,And show that they come (Inaudible) the statute.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2051.549,2055.501,And some of them are hard in hearing and so forth.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2055.501,2063.092,"Then if it gets down below what the statutes says it has to have to get them into a strike, it is send down and get what you call (Inaudible)."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2063.092,2064.013,"(Inaudible), yes sir."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2064.013,2065.784,Go down in summons them and bring them in.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2065.784,2066.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2066.764,2067.793,Sheriff --
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2067.793,2068.487,That's right.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2068.487,2075.704,That's the system you have here is they get -- the defendant gets two strikes and the other -- on this mark.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2075.704,2077.612,In -- in criminal cases.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.612,2080.498,In the civil cases that's one on one.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2080.498,2082.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.525,2109.285,"In some of those legislation that was peculiar to Talladega County unlike with the petitioner's brief in the appendix they have the main statutory provisions is that on the top of the 8 (a) that the -- that the special legislation begins which is peculiar to this county, well, and goes all the way through the -- through 11 (a)."
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2109.285,2111.267,So far in the appendix?
1964.64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.267,2112.823,Appendix to the petitioner's brief.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2112.823,2113.28,Yes.
1964.64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.28,2130.07,There are set out that various constitutional provisions in Alabama statutes and that most of them seems to be of general application and I'm asking whether the ones of exclusive application to this county begin at the top of 8 (a) and end at 11 (a) that's in the information.
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2130.07,2131.06,That is correct sir.
1964.64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.06,2131.768,Is that it?
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2131.768,2133.117,Yes sir.
1964.64,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2133.117,2146.043,Mr. Hall can you explain to us why was this thing point -- pointed out that the Commission (Inaudible)
1964.64,1,34535,leslie_hall,,2146.043,2150.616,Well now I think the commissioners did the best they could under the circumstances to --
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3251.112,3258.775,"I think Mr. Justice Black if you would looked at Section 63 of the Title, I don't have it here."
1964.64,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3294.974,3296.748,-- the felony was then kind of a --
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3296.748,3298.785,"No, not just capital cases."
1964.64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3408.948,3413.282,"It's an ideal world, he wouldn't be able to do it, would he?"
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3416.6,3425.701,"Well, he should have some system whereby all qualified persons I would think are placed on the jury roll as the statute here required."
1964.64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3425.701,3428.333,But he should be (Inaudible).
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3428.333,3428.929,Well yes.
1964.64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3430.055,3433.119,"He should know, I put so many Negroes on."
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3433.119,3435.117,Well he should be able to name some.
1964.64,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3443.213,3445.622,But what -- what you mean is he should follow the law in --
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3445.622,3447.538,That's right.
1964.64,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3448.658,3457.075,-- there is trial below and that run in the trial with (Inaudible) went direct to the Negroes and put them on the list of liberty.
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3457.075,3457.783,"Yes, that's right."
1964.64,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3462.385,3465.285,But he started a pretty tough job there.
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3465.285,3465.76,Pardon me?
1964.64,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3465.76,3467.586,Not and (Inaudible).
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3480.316,3489.762,Well I think the best way that -- to get around that is to have an impartial method whereby you select a large number of qualified persons.
1964.64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3492.887,3499.752,But it -- you suggest that it would be appropriate to -- to go to all Negro organizations to -- to (Inaudible).
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3499.752,3509.6,"Well if that's the way or method of getting it, if that's the method, it's to get names from organizations only then I say they should go to Negro and White organizations if this is your method."
1964.64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3509.6,3510.209,I see.
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3510.209,3518.854,"But they didn't have that method particularly, they sometimes went to the jury to the telephone booth, sometimes in the city directory and so forth."
1964.64,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3529.827,3534.747,(Voice overlap) just took some out of each page.
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3536.202,3546.984,"No, whatever method they used if they used it as the method and that method was used on Negroes and Whites alike, of course that would be all right."
1964.64,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3546.984,3551.081,But you explain then that the Negroes didn't have a cell phone or --
1964.64,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,3551.081,3557.135,"Well if that were a fact that they knew, that happened to be the fact in that community."
