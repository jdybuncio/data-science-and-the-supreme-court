1985.84-1948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.996,We will hear arguments next in Secretary of Agriculture against Payne.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,14.039,17.241,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.985,455.252,"Mr. Kuhlik, can I ask you right there, one of the things that is troubling about the case is its age."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,470.339,475.601,If the lawsuit were brought after the expiration of the loan application--
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.601,477.991,Missed by a couple of days and said they didn't know what--
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,477.991,482.163,--Our position would be that the courts did not have authority to set aside the deadline.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.163,484.503,--There is really no remedy.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,489.642,497.39,"For this particular violation, given the failure of the respondent class to bring the lawsuit before the expiration of the deadline--"
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.39,500.654,You wouldn't have to bring the lawsuit if they were ahead of the deadline.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,502.217,502.732,--Of course.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.671,540.858,"Well, for the purpose of this argument, are you conceding there was a violation or are you arguing in the alternative, there was no violation anyway?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,540.858,543.728,We are most certainly not conceding that there has been a violation.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.481,551.32,"Well, assume with me just for the moment, because apparently the lower courts disagreed with you on that."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,558.726,562.692,"That there was still no remedy of this estoppel like nature, that is correct."
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.692,564.223,"Well, of any kind."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,564.754,567.596,"Of any kind, that is correct at this point in time."
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,570.346,574.546,"--Before you go ahead, may I follow up on the questions that Justice Stevens had asked?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,624.807,635.32,"--Justice Powell, the press release that the Court of Appeals is referring to here on page 7-A is not the press release that it found insufficiently informative later."
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,641.348,644.519,Is it clear from the record that the farmers had adequate notice?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,644.519,647.439,--We think it completely clear from the record.
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,651.841,653.047,"As a matter of fact, did they have notice."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,655.702,662.573,--There were no findings made by the district court with respect to whether any individual class member did or did not have notice.
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,668.525,671.086,Is it not a fact that very few applications were made?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,671.086,678.223,"It is true that very few applications were made, however, we don't believe the reasons for that are relevant."
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,705.289,715.942,"So, even though the government concluded that in view of the situation additional loans could be made, for whatever reason, very few people applied for them?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,715.942,716.722,That is right.
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,716.722,718.442,May I ask this question?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,723.69,725.828,We do not believe that it could be.
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,725.828,730.498,"In other words, your position is that if no notice whatever was given, there could be no estoppel."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,730.498,731.387,That is right.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.375,1027.06,"May I ask whether you would take the same position if the regulation had not been published in the Federal Register, had just been put in somebody's desk drawer and nobody had access to it?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1027.06,1030.184,--The application deadline regulation?
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.184,1030.746,Yes.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1030.746,1034.711,I am not sure whether we would.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.473,1054.126,What I want to know is the only defect would be a total failure to make it possible for anyone to know about the regulation.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1054.126,1060.935,"--In those circumstances, the application deadline would not be valid under the APA, I don't believe."
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.935,1061.715,Why not?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1061.715,1078.643,"Well, if the APA provided that the application deadline would have to be published in the Federal Register on pain of it not being enforceable against persons without actual knowledge of the regulation, then it would not be enforceable except as to those people who had knowledge of it."
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.05,1086.766,I am assuming no publicity at all.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1086.766,1088.36,--If there were no publicity at all--
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.36,1099.072,That you have the same practical consequences that your opponents contend happened... I know you disagree... but that they also really had no possible means of getting access to the information.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1099.072,1110.241,"--I believe under the circumstances that you are stating, Justice Stevens, that there would not be an estoppel problem because that regulation or that internal instruction would not be enforceable."
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1123.581,1126.564,I just want to be sure I do understand.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1138.434,1146.428,"My answer is that if the application deadline is published in the Federal Register, then there is no requirement that the government give additional--"
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1146.428,1148.865,Then you are saying it had to be published in the Federal Register?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1148.865,1149.79,--That is right.
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1149.79,1153.287,"If not, the government would not be estopped."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1153.287,1158.065,If there were no... If the regulation--
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.065,1159.831,"If not published, the government would be estopped."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1159.831,1168.795,"--If the loan application deadline were not published in the manner necessary for it to be a binding regulation, then there wouldn't be an estoppel question."
1985.84-1948,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1170.546,1172.559,You are saying the notice itself is irrelevant.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1177.308,1180.042,I doubt very much that any of them do.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.85,1226.945,Let me be sure I understand.
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1234.253,1235.002,--I don't believe they do.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.127,1250.295,"But, if so, there is just a statement in the Federal Register that loan program number XYZ expires on such and such a date without telling anybody what loan program XYZ is, that would be sufficient to protect the government from liability."
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1250.295,1251.73,I believe it would.
1985.84-1948,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.882,1267.694,Why do you suppose they didn't?
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1267.694,1271.676,"--Well, I think the record shows a couple of things."
1985.84-1948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.13,1355.126,"Mr. Kuhlik, am I right in thinking that the deadline was an administratively imposed one, not one imposed by statute?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1355.126,1358.655,That is the conclusion the Court of Appeals reached and we are not challenging that here.
1985.84-1948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.655,1365.951,"And, am I also right in thinking that any requirement for publicity was also an administrative requirement, not one in the statute?"
1985.84-1948,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1365.951,1367.901,There was no mention of publicity in the statute.
1985.84-1948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.002,1399.031,Mr. Tripp?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1399.031,1403.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.934,1567.4,Is there something in the legislative history or the statute itself that leads you to the conclusion that the Congress knew about the existence of this regulation?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1567.4,1572.476,Not directly to the existence of the regulation.
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.201,1605.042,Didn't Congress extend whatever deadline there was by 90 days or something like that?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1605.042,1618.361,"Justice White, in the enactment of 93-237, which came later, after 93-24, they did, when confusion arose among the farmers as to what--"
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.361,1621.313,Isn't it clear that Congress intended there to be a deadline?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1621.313,1624.608,--It is clear that Congress intended there to be a deadline.
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.608,1625.716,"So, it is a statutory deadline?"
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1625.716,1626.418,No.
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.418,1634.572,"Well, if it is 90 days from whatever it was, that sounds to me like a statutory deadline."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1634.572,1646.597,The Court of Appeals feels and we feel the legislative history shows that that was more in the nature of action by Congress to insure that people were not--
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.597,1660.514,"Well, suppose the agency had previously administratively set March 1, 1985 as a deadline and the Congress comes along and says please extend that deadline for 90 days."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1663.326,1665.542,"--No, sir, Justice White."
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.542,1667.87,It is still an administrative deadline?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1667.87,1674.869,"Well, the 90-day deadline existed before 93-237."
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.869,1675.337,Yes.
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1675.337,1681.24,It has been an on-going deadline that applies not just to this disaster but to each and every disaster.
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.632,1723.971,At least Congress sanctioned the closing of the loans after the 90-day extension.
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1723.971,1734.016,"In our view, Justice Rehnquist, Congress required a minimum extension of the application period--"
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.016,1737.374,And was satisfied with the 90-day extension.
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1737.374,1740.466,"--At that time, that is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.466,1743.278,"And, was there later word from Congress that it was unhappy?"
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,1745.508,1750.804,"No, sir, I do not believe that Congress has spoken again to that subject."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.663,1995.142,"Well, now, Mr. Tripp, in Maryland against Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, there a government agent, kind of comparably situated to the ones you have been talking about, made an affirmative representation to a farmer that his wheat crop was covered by federal crop insurance."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2015.491,2017.725,"For at least two reasons, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.22,2033.846,"No, but he affirmatively supplied misinformation."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2033.846,2042.198,"That is correct, Your Honor, but as I recall the facts of that case, there was no alternative available to that farmer."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.056,2052.009,"But, that wasn't the reasoning of this Court."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2061.77,2075.906,"That is correct, but I do not believe that that has been extended by this Court to suggest that you may not remedy the failure of an agency to comply with its own regulations."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.177,2104.053,"Again, there is no question but the reliance was reasonable in the Merrill case."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2108.283,2133.743,"--The third distinction that I would suggest, Justice Rehnquist, between the Merrill case and this case is that the Merrill case did not present a situation where an agency has, through misrepresentation or inaction, frustrated a congressional intent."
1985.84-1948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2191.562,2202.402,"You know, counsel, it isn't all that clear to me that the courts were below were correct in saying that the agency violated its own publicity regulations."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2233.014,2239.791,"Justice O'Connor, there are four aspects to the publicity regulations."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.906,2435.963,Would your view be that under present application it would be enough to have met the hardship requirements as of 1973 or would you have to show hardship now?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2435.963,2444.569,"--Well, as the Solicitor General himself concedes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is not need which defines participation, it is loss."
1985.84-1948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.699,2476.603,"So, there isn't any hardship requirement or any requirement you can't get credit elsewhere?"
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2476.603,2480.601,Not under 93-237.
1985.84-1948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.688,2538.173,What is the interest rate available on this particular category of loans?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2538.173,2547.496,The interest rate initially under the first application period was five percent which would have been the same as operating loans.
1985.84-1948,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.036,2649.594,"Counsel, agreeing with you if I should, it is going to be quite difficult to show what happened 15 years ago, isn't it?"
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2649.594,2652.015,Mr. Justice--
1985.84-1948,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.015,2653.079,On both sides.
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2660.153,2678.583,"--The regulations which were in effect in 1973, at the time of this loss, and which continue in effect today, provide that with regard to production losses the applicant's statement of loss shall be accepted without further investigation if it seems--"
1985.84-1948,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.583,2681.582,My question is how can he present it?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2685.567,2700.435,"--Justice Marshall, I believe that most a lot of farmers, for example... Mr. Ellie, who was a named Plaintiff, has an arrangement whereby he borrows money from the Farmers Home Administration, he pledges his crops."
1985.84-1948,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.623,2735.527,How about the farmer who sold out and left?
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2735.527,2757.318,"I believe the farmer who sold out and left has simply been... irrevocably deprived of his right to participate in this program, but those who have hung in, we assert, are the benificiaries of a congressional intent that those who suffer losses be given an opportunity to apply following reasonable notice."
1985.84-1948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.318,2779.322,"I take it you would be making the same argument if the statute unambigously said that all applications will be made before a certain date, April 30, 1979."
1985.84-1948,1,43378,theodore_l_tripp_jr,,2800.676,2803.546,"Absolutely not, Justice White."
1985.84-1948,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.734,2874.392,Very well.
1985.84-1948,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2876.985,2878.295,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1948,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.775,2930.323,I take it you are not urging that this was the statutory deadline.
1985.84-1948,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2930.323,2934.116,"--No, we are not, but the fact is that they are the same thing."
1985.84-1948,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.499,3031.074,"Thank you, gentlemen."
