1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.869,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-471, Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Guy Hunt, Governor of Alabama."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,12.099,14.723,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.444,136.526,"Mr. Pincus, if there were no Federal legislation governing this area do you suppose the State of Alabama could just ban any importation of hazardous waste into the state?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,136.526,142.8,If there were no Federal legislation--
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.8,143.201,Right.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,143.201,149.425,"--at all, then that would come very close to resembling the kinds of statutes that this Court upheld in the quarantine cases."
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.425,150.076,Exactly.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,150.076,152.788,"Of course, as your question points out, there are two distinctions here."
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.17,166.095,"Well, do you suppose instead of a ban they could just knowingly impose a tax at such a level that it would discourage the importation?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,166.095,172.55,"We think not, Justice O'Connor, because we think the local purposes underlying those two types of statutes are very different."
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.002,221.546,"Well, I don't know that that follows."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,253.426,257.868,"But again, Justice Scalia, that's not the interest that's underlying their statute."
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.936,273.828,"Oh, but they do want Alabama generators totally taken care of."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,273.828,274.9,I know they do.
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.9,277.201,"Of course, because they're a responsible state."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,293.44,295.363,"Well, Your Honor, the problem is they're not taking care of it."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.932,330.546,"Mr. Pincus, where abouts in Alabama is Emelle?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,330.546,335.077,"Emelle is located on the border with Mississippi, sort of toward the middle of the state."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.077,336.239,Thank you.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,336.239,361.997,"We think that the question whether this, the interest that Alabama asserts here are sufficient to justify upholding the first discriminatory tax outside of the compensating tax area is answered by this Court's decision in City of Philadelphia, and the answer is no."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.061,372.004,"But there you didn't have the hazardous waste problem, Mr. Pincus."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,372.004,388.965,"--Well, Your Honor, New Jersey's, the rationale that New Jersey relied upon was precisely the same protection of the public health and the environment that Alabama is relying on here, and the Court expressly said we're not saying that New Jersey is wrong about the fact that the statute will protect that interest."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.232,409.729,"But the, what was actually being transported was simply garbage, which I suppose has some dangers inherent, but I don't believe it's the same as the hazardous waste."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,409.729,416.594,"--Well, as I say, Your Honor, the Court did not, did not go off on some kind of level of hazard."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.384,455.94,Could Alabama impose a requirement that provided for the least possible transportation of that stuff within Alabama?
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,455.94,467.648,"--Alabama could try and enact an entirely different statute that did regulate transportation, and then we'd have to see precisely what it did, whether--"
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.648,477.442,What if it said only hazardous waste generated within 100 miles of the Emelle facility can be brought there?
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,477.442,479.245,--May be disposed of there?
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.245,481.235,May be disposed of there.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,481.235,484.657,"Well, we think that that statute would be unconstitutional for the very reasons we are urging here."
1991.91-471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.903,494.705,"Yes, but you could lose that case and still win this one."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,494.705,501.739,"We could certainly lose that case, Justice White, and still win this one because Alabama has not done that, and it hasn't purported to do anything about transportation."
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.739,503.331,"Well, Mr.--"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,513.135,514.818,"We don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,523.303,529.097,The EPA has approved a similar state tax scheme for South Carolina.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,529.978,539.375,"Well, we... let me just, I'm sorry... in addition to the procedural problem, we don't think Congress has authorized discrimination here."
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.889,647.599,"Mr. Pincus, suppose it could be shown that what Alabama had in mind was it wanted to be sure that there were private facilities available within Alabama to dispose of dangerous materials in Alabama, which is certainly a substantial state interest."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,688.486,695.0,"Well, Your Honor, I think the problem with the hypothetical is that it's focusing on the state as the market."
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.455,701.966,Not for dangerous goods.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,708.62,721.64,"--In think your cases say that if there was a quarantine statute, a flat ban on any importation, and if the state proves the kind of danger that was established in those cases, that those kinds of statutes will be upheld."
1991.91-471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.425,731.955,All or nothing at all.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,737.008,749.447,"Well, you cannot take account of it in... if the state doesn't have that interest, then it's not entitled to discriminate because it's interest is by definition less."
1991.91-471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,795.642,800.744,"Of course if Alabama could prove that there was no safe way to dispose of this stuff you would lose, wouldn't you?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,800.744,802.646,If Alabama--
1991.91-471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.646,807.971,"Because then you'd be in the same, you'd be in the same category as the quarantine cases."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,807.971,819.448,"--If Alabama had enacted a quarantine statute which indicated that that was its interest, and if it showed that in fact allowing additional items such as this into the state, yes, then I think we'd lose."
1991.91-471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.449,842.965,"So in effect you're saying, as I guess you did to Justice Scalia, that it's got to be an all or nothing rule?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,842.965,845.045,I think that's right.
1991.91-471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.792,899.071,"Well, it seems to me that you're conceding that noxious wastes of this kind cannot be distinguished from quarantine if a quarantine law is passed."
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,901.352,928.891,"--No, Your Honor, that's what I was just saying is I think this case is different because these regulatory schemes are in place, and I think Alabama would have difficulty making a showing of uncontrollable danger that was, that the states had to make in those cases to justify their quarantines precisely because there is here a regulatory scheme that covers transportation, every facet of these wastes' handling and disposal is covered in a way that very, very significantly lessens the danger."
1991.91-471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.891,944.161,"--Is one way to characterize that circumstance of the law to say that there is a commerce in waste, but that there was not a commerce in the noxious products that were the subject of the quarantine cases?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,948.222,968.496,"I think many of the quarantine cases do state that those items are not items of commerce because they are so objectionable, because they threaten the state, the very existence of life and the environment within the state, and we don't think... and therefore the legal conclusion was they are not commerce, and because of the state of the court's jurisprudence at the time the state can regulate them."
1991.91-471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,981.675,985.368,--And it seems to me the quarantine cases might be distinguishable on that basis.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,985.368,987.999,"--Well, I think that's right."
1991.91-471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.981,1010.734,But I'm not sure that the existence of state regulation is what controls whether there is a commerce in waste or not.
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1013.085,1018.928,"--Well, there is, there certainly is a business in waste and in the transportation and disposal--"
1991.91-471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1018.928,1020.0,And there was not that finding in the quarantine cases?
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1020.0,1023.643,"--There certainly was not, Your Honor, and that is an important distinction also."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.643,1032.397,"So if someone wants to go into the business of shipping diseased cattle from one state to another, does that diseased cow become an item of commerce?"
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1032.397,1039.512,"The diseased cattle would be an item of commerce, and I think that follows exactly from what the Court said in City of Philadelphia where it says everything is an item of commerce."
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.766,1062.869,So it's the same test in any event as--
1991.91-471,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1062.869,1063.668,--It's exactly the same test.
1991.91-471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.002,1070.874,"--Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1072.524,1082.512,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.623,1178.504,You could say the same thing about diseased cattle.
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1196.146,1200.14,"--It does, but there are several ways to look at the quarantine cases."
1991.91-471,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.137,1301.368,"Mr. Kneedler, what if the state decided to start all over again from scratch and it could prove that in fact there was no safe way to handle the stuff, that in-state, out-of-state, it was all a health hazard regardless of what the Federal Government was saying."
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1332.438,1335.072,I don't know whether it would be an absolute bar.
1991.91-471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.28,1531.074,"You wouldn't allow a total ban either, I gather from what you said before."
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1531.074,1535.709,"Well, it would be subject to separate standards."
1991.91-471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.425,1655.789,You don't agree with Mr. Pincus then that the Commerce Clause jurisprudence has changed?
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1655.789,1667.898,"--I think the labels or the categories in which the Court has described Commerce Clause analysis has changed, but I think that the essential truth of what the Court has been driving at in the cases has really not changed."
1991.91-471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.38,1688.601,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1991.91-471,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1688.601,1689.842,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.842,1691.021,"Mr. Nettles, we'll hear from you."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1691.021,1697.737,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.365,1809.012,Do you think anything you have said has suggested anything else than that Alabama could keep out all out-of-state hazardous waste?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1809.012,1814.035,"--Your Honor, that would be a more serious test."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.087,1816.617,I don't know.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1826.693,1831.658,"--Your Honor, this is a modified type Commerce Clause case."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.67,1857.443,"Well, why don't you just, why don't you just limit the amount of outside waste that can come in?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1857.443,1861.637,"--Well, that is one of the purposes of the statute."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.657,1866.619,One of the purposes is also to make some money off of outside waste.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1866.619,1868.161,"Your Honor, we would--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.161,1868.592,Isn't that right?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1868.943,1870.103,--That's one of the factors.
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.128,1901.193,--You don't think the same thing would apply to just plain trash?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,1901.193,1902.763,"--No, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2003.133,2009.626,"Well, I guess Alabama could impose a uniform tax on all waste, in-state and out."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2009.626,2012.437,--And that is done under a base fee.
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2044.289,2046.48,So you're defending a scheme that's ineffective?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2046.48,2047.682,"No, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.387,2091.46,But if the fee is so successful it seems to me that then everyone should have to pay it.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2095.532,2098.674,"Well, the purpose we have--"
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.674,2105.73,"Well, your purpose could be precisely served, as you have just demonstrated it seems to me, by having a fee that's the same for in-state and out-of-state."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2105.73,2107.38,"--Well, the purpose there--"
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2107.38,2108.371,Now we have a simple Commerce Clause case.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2108.371,2136.721,"--But, Your Honor, we would submit that this is a police power case in the sense that Alabama is one of a handful of states that happen to have a hazardous waste landfill in operation at the time of RCRA, and that since RCRA was adopted and since the amendments to RCRA in 1980 there have been no further hazardous waste facilities with one exception permitted."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.232,2202.745,So you're going to cure that just by raising the price of out-of-state waste?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2202.745,2204.664,--By reducing the volumes.
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.647,2224.74,"Well, your in-state wastes are contributing to the whole problem too, aren't they?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2224.74,2228.032,"But to a much lesser extent, and this, Alabama's--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.032,2228.323,"Well, I don't know."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2238.488,2240.851,--What we're doing is attempting to approach--
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.851,2241.03,Does it?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2241.521,2244.152,--approach this on a balancing bit.
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.589,2278.685,"--Well, I can't think of an interstate Commerce Clause case where the out-of-state burden was greater than the in-state burden just by share of numbers."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2278.685,2279.535,Your Honor--
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2279.535,2281.788,"You'd have to talk about trucking, traffic, whatever it is."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2286.069,2288.16,"--That's the uniqueness of this case, we submit."
1991.91-471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.358,2372.976,Mr. Nettles--
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2372.976,2374.048,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.048,2386.126,--It's a very sensible way to allocate the limited portion of your landfill that you want to go to out-of-state hazardous waste to use the rationing mechanism of price.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2422.879,2443.476,"But no hazardous waste situation, Your Honor, no record in any of those tax cases or highway transportation cases, any that approach the concern or even talk about police power considerations that are involved here with the protection of health and safety and the environment."
1991.91-471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.554,2452.599,All we know for sure is that you're making a lot of money on it and imposing substantial costs on out-of-state industries which your own industries don't have to bear.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2457.863,2460.665,--But Alabama industries are there.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.753,2598.346,"But Mr. Nettles, isn't it true that you do have a cap on the amount of waste that, altogether?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2598.346,2598.876,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.928,2603.571,"Well, why do you need an additional means to bring it down?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2603.571,2611.324,"--Because of the fact that we still have the volume of over 250,000 tons of out-of-state hazardous waste coming in."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.935,2614.327,"Is that your limit, the 250,000 tons?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2614.327,2614.778,--No.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.149,2622.171,But the cap doesn't differentiate between in-state and out-of-state waste?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2622.171,2623.182,"--No, sir, it does not."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.182,2628.466,"So if you've got a cap that apparently you can handle, why then do you have to charge some waste more than others?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2628.466,2630.316,Because the problem is still there.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.38,2644.157,"Yeah, but does the cap keep it from, I mean, does the additional, the $72 tax make it less than the cap, or just another way is making sure nobody violates the cap?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2644.157,2648.888,--The more waste you put into that river of toxins there at Emelle--
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.888,2650.16,"But you can't put in more than the cap, can you?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2650.16,2659.076,"--No, sir, but you still have, even with the cap in place, that's left us with 250, more than 250,000 tons of out-of-state waste coming in."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.076,2661.918,"But you're going to have that 250,000 tons no matter whether you've got this tax or not."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2661.918,2678.851,"And the point is then you look at the compensatory nature of it, the fact that this is a transfer of risk, of actual risk from out-of-state into Alabama of very dangerous toxins that are involved in this, unlike anything else."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.911,2682.134,Do you ship any hazardous waste out of the state yourselves?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2682.134,2682.993,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.647,2687.577,"If they prohibited that, that Texas wouldn't take that."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2687.577,2705.679,"--We would have no problem with the fact that other states who accommodate our waste water situation, we have an agreement set up that they charge a differential fee to accommodate Alabama in that respect, just as we are accommodating other states who are transferring their problems to us."
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.679,2709.69,I thought we overruled such reciprocal arrangements in the Katrell case.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2709.69,2714.134,"But that, Your Honor, we submit was not a police power hazardous waste case."
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.216,2716.274,You say police power.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2719.608,2725.802,--Not where the health and safety and welfare of the people are involved and environmental concerns.
1991.91-471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2725.802,2727.843,"I can't think of any law that's not for the health, safety, and welfare of the people."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2731.605,2756.372,"Well, the degree here is certainly accentuated and it is set out in the record that we have here the documentation not only of the trial in Alabama, 4-day trial and the depositions that went on before then, but we have the General Accounting Office's own report that shows that there is just no long range planning by EPA, has been none to plan beyond 30 years."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.112,2792.133,What do they mean by sanitary waste disposals?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2792.133,2792.804,Your Honor--
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.804,2796.347,Do you think that's an oxymoron or something?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2796.347,2796.768,--Yes.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.772,2829.509,"You've asked about the Chicago River, do you suppose it would have helped if they had tried to keep the Wisconsin water out of the river and the Michigan water and just let Illinois water up the river?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2832.612,2833.783,The volumes there.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.783,2836.324,"Sure, but you've got a control on the volume here."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2836.324,2845.392,But it's not sufficient in and of itself to say that those volume controls of the cap will cure the problems.
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.714,2882.706,"But those findings that detail, and they are detailed in the legislature and in the trial court, do not indicate, unlike the Maine against, the Maine case with the fish inspection, that there's any difference at all between the out-of-state waste and the locally generated waste in terms of the hazard."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2882.706,2891.792,"--Well, again, the volumes, the findings, the first two or three specific findings of the legislature address the volumes coming in from out-of-state."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.792,2892.223,Right.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2892.223,2903.939,"Secondly, there was testimony in the trial court from Tom Joiner, a former state geologist and also from Sue Robinson, official with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, that the volumes were the problem."
1991.91-471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.499,2937.61,"But Mr. Nettles, I think Justice Stevens asked you wasn't there a finding that there was no difference in toxicity as between local waste and... or did the court not find any difference in toxicity between local waste and out-of-state waste."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,2939.933,2948.939,"The trial court found there was no difference in the, to distinguish in-state waste from out-of-state waste."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.665,3068.677,Just as long as you get paid enough you can increase the risk to your people?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3068.677,3070.867,"No, sir, because--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.867,3071.728,"Well, what is it then?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3078.895,3081.396,--The threat is the large volumes.
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.215,3082.786,"Well, all right."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3096.036,3104.961,"But, Your Honor, this is the thing that has brought the volumes down, that has reduced the threat of the compounding--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.961,3111.475,"Well, that still means that as long as they pay enough you'll let them transfer the risk."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3111.475,3113.296,"--Well, sir, because we have--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.296,3113.847,Is that right?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3113.847,3124.914,"--Again, we submit that that is the appropriate way to address this, the reasonable way, and still remain a player in the national marketplace, not to isolate ourselves from the problem."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.997,3132.939,So suppose you charge what the traffic will bear?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3132.939,3136.211,"--Again, Your Honor, the question was--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.211,3138.044,From outside.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3144.966,3149.24,--In this instance it's established that the ratio has remained constant.
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.775,3163.95,"Well, maybe if you charged a higher price to your locals they would be more careful about generating solid, hazardous waste."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3163.95,3165.971,And we did increase the price to the locals.
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.971,3167.483,"Well, I know, but not to $72."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3167.483,3168.111,"No, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.148,3188.734,"Well therefore I would think they ought to... if they're going to consistently and for over the long-term contribute to this risk, they, why shouldn't they have to pay what others do?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3188.734,3201.293,"Because, Your Honor, it's the nature of the risk, we submit, is the compounding, the synergistic effect of the tremendous volumes, the threat of that coming in from out-of-state."
1991.91-471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.741,3222.818,"No, but isn't it perfectly clear if we just apply the laws of economics, if you raise the tax to your locals to $72 a ton, or whatever it is, you would have less waste generated in Alabama?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3227.109,3231.843,"But that overlooks, Your Honor, we submit, the key distinction here."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.248,3340.457,"I take it that, from what you just said that you have some doubt about your being able to satisfy the normal Commerce Clause test where there is a discrimination."
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3340.457,3341.276,Your Honor--
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.276,3342.418,Do you or do you not?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3342.418,3351.423,"--We... no, sir, we don't, in the sense that there is, we submit, still the difference, the--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.423,3360.841,"So you think you really have to go to another rationale, namely an expansion of the quarantine cases?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3360.841,3371.727,"--That, Your Honor, that coupled with the difference, the threat in difference and the nature of the risk because of the fact that the volumes change them."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.727,3372.138,So your answer is yes.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3373.667,3374.268,"No, sir."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.268,3379.253,--You just said you couldn't satisfy the normal Commerce Clause test.
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3379.253,3386.095,"Well, because what we're showing is that on its face it may be discriminatory, but in the practical effect it is not."
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.072,3401.115,So you're saying that you can satisfy the normal Commerce Clause test?
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3401.115,3406.609,"We would submit we could, Your Honor, because the practical effect of what Alabama--"
1991.91-471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.609,3416.577,"Well, why isn't there a non-discriminatory way of controlling the volume of hazardous waste that you're willing to put up with in your state?"
1991.91-471,2,17916,bert_s_nettles,,3416.577,3443.995,"--We respectfully submit that this is in its practical effect not discriminatory because of the fact that the nature of the risk is different because of the tremendous volumes coming in from out-of-state, and you have a balancing test, we submit, that would be the more, that has been recognized and would be appropriate in this instance where you balance the risk and burdens to Alabama as opposed to the risk and burdens of outside."
1991.91-471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3466.469,3469.049,"Thank you, Mr. Nettles."
1991.91-471,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3471.881,3473.143,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3560.33,3562.012,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
