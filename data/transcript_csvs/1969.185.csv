1969.185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.426,Reetz against Bozanich.
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,26.383,29.42,May it please the Court.
1969.185,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,228.972,230.62,Would you state that again.
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,230.62,258.648,"The Court in the three-judge district court concluded that in fact, for a person to be illegible for a salmon net gear license in Alaska, he had to receive employment by those already engaged in the fishery and therefore the right to his license was not within his control but was with in the control of others."
1969.185,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,272.278,274.795,Does the state contest that?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,274.795,308.58,"The state contest its finding Mr. Justice, on the basis that it is not supported by any facts presently in the record or by any implications which could be drawn from those facts in the record and we feel that the provision of the statute which also was a license to be issued to one who fishes commercially for three years is sufficient in allowing new entry into the fishery."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.58,313.851,What was the basis for the District Court's conclusion in that respect?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,319.852,320.954,No Mr. Justice.
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.988,336.532,"Or has had a salmon license the last year, in any year in the particular area?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,336.532,341.065,Or has had a salmon license in any year in the particular area.
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.065,355.409,"Well then, what was the basis for the District Court's conclusion that just as a matter of the way the statute operated, no one could get a license unless existing fisherman approved him, is that it?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,355.409,356.474,Yes Mr. Justice.
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.267,399.187,"Let me ask you, in these salmon fishing areas, how would one be a commercial fisherman except by fishing for salmon, are there other fish, commercial fish on those same areas?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,399.187,399.325,Mr. --
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.325,401.904,That he can make a living catching?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,401.904,412.993,"Mr. Justice, I would answer that question by stating yes, one can fish commercially in Alaska for fish other than salmon and this is done --"
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.993,420.172,"As a matter of fact, does anybody do it and make a living without fishing for salmon in those areas?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,420.172,433.34,"Again, this is off the -- this is not disclosed by the record but I would assume that there are people who make a living fishing for halibut, fishing for cramp."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.34,436.148,In those same salmon areas?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,436.148,452.271,"Yes, although this again gets to my basic point that in order to determine to answer your question sir, there would have to be hearings at the District Court level in order to answer this question."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.923,482.423,"Well, lets assume that a man works as an employee for a salmon fishery for three years then applies for his own salmon license, has he satisfied the statute?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,482.423,494.833,"Yes, if he has while working for the salmon, I suppose the boat owner or somebody who has the gear, if he has worked while licensed as a commercial fisherman which I believe --"
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.833,500.424,Do you have to be licensed as a commercial fisherman to work as an employee for a salmon fisherman?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,500.424,507.117,Generally I would -- I think you do Your Honor in order to engage in the activity of fishing.
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.111,514.174,Even as an employee?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,514.174,531.165,"If that employee is in fact fishing, he would have to have a commercial fishing license and the license -- the issuance of that license is not restricted, he pays depending on whether he's a resident or non resident at $10.00 fee or a $30.00 fee."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.351,542.46,"Well, does the law require you to actually the fish three years as a commercial fisherman rather than just to hold the license as a commercial fisherman?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,542.46,544.742,The law does require that you fish.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,748.535,751.526,What do you mean by 11 areas?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,751.526,771.662,"Mr. Justice, Alaska, the coastline in which the salmon fishery is engaged covers approximately 3000 or 3500 miles from southeast Alaska near Ketchikan up through near the Artic Ocean."
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,857.428,863.535,"I don't quite understand it yet, what your point is?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,863.535,875.222,My point is that if a fisherman is licensed in southeast Alaska as a --
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,875.222,876.374,One of the 11 areas?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,876.374,892.022,"One of the 11 areas, that the very fact that he has to acquire a license to fish in Bristol Bay in some other year and that fact --"
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,892.022,893.023,Some other year?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,893.023,893.347,Right.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,913.672,915.317,What's your point then?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,918.103,935.099,"Yeah, my point is that the deprivation of his right to fish based upon the application of the area requirement is not necessarily clear from the state of the record as it appeared in the lower court."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.21,975.243,Does the court rest on this matter?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,975.243,982.237,The District Court did not discuss this ground too heavily Mr. Justice.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1213.851,1220.808,"Why it is not quoted in your brief, the provisions of the constitution?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1220.808,1234.268,Mr. Justice I believe it's quoted at the very beginning under constitutional provisions on page 3.
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.948,1463.266,"The answer to the District Court's invalidation of the statute under the Alaska constitution, is your only answer that it shouldn't have done so, it should have differed to the state courts, or are you asking us to disagree with Court, with the three-judge court on the construction of the Alaska constitution?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1463.266,1470.14,"Mr. Justice, I'm not asking you to disagree with the construction of the Alaska Court."
1969.185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.841,1496.942,So your only answer is to differ to the state court?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1496.942,1520.702,"Mr. Justice, one other answer would be that at the present stage of the record, the application of the statute in the light of the Alaska constitutional provision is not necessarily -- does not necessarily reach the result that that provision has violated."
1969.185,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1526.075,1536.476,"I understand that the three-judge court rested on two grounds, one was equal protection, Fourteenth Amendment and one was on the Alaska constitution, is that right?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1536.476,1538.634,"Mr. Justice Douglas, that is correct."
1969.185,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1538.634,1549.257,"Then if equal protection is valid, there's no point in us even concerning the state ground?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1549.257,1561.422,Depending on -- depending upon the position that this Court takes in its application of the abstention doctrine.
1969.185,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1592.086,1595.047,"Well, that's a different ground, yes."
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1595.047,1604.702,And that there was nothing before the Court sufficient to justify its conclusion at that time.
1969.185,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.702,1615.764,Has there been any litigation at all in the state courts in Alaska about these claims or any similar claims with respect to this legislation?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1615.764,1618.368,"Mr. Justice, none."
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1653.529,1671.927,A decision could be made by the Alaska Court on the law -- state law to which you refer that would leave the case in such situation that you did not have to still try the equal protection question.
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1671.927,1698.766,"Mr. Justice Black, the Alaska Court could decide although the state would naturally fight the issue heavily in the state court but it is possible that it could reach a decision that the statute is in violation of the exclusive right and common privilege provisions of the Alaska constitution."
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1699.106,1700.718,That was not the law out there --
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1700.718,1722.515,"If that were so, that would knock the entire statute out since the provisions do not apply themselves piece meal across the statute if it is unconstitutional under state law, the entire statute is unconstitutional and there would be nothing left to determine in the light of the federal constitution."
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1722.515,1733.305,"Because there would be no advantage of us that this law and passing it back to the state law, they are going to hold that, would they?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1733.305,1739.527,There'd certainly be no advantage to the state if that were the conclusion of the state court.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1739.527,1741.21,And knock it out?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1741.21,1741.889,However --
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1741.889,1746.003,"That's what the attack on it is about, isn't it?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1746.003,1748.074,This is one of the attacks.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1787.651,1793.936,You'd still leave hanging far that this question of denial of the equal protection of the law.
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1793.936,1797.462,This under that result -- this would be possible Mr. Justice.
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1797.462,1802.364,Thought it would be not -- it would be more impossible wouldn't it?
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1802.801,1812.851,"That would be a fact that if the state court resolved that the statute was constitutional, the federal question would remain for decision."
1969.185,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1814.052,1819.858,"Then you have to go back to the Federal court, would you, or the by the state court?"
1969.185,0,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1821.437,1851.166,"My theory on this Mr. Justice, under the more recent decisions of this Court and particularly the England versus Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, that the federal question should be reserved in the Federal court for its determination that the state court should not determine if there's the abstention doctrine, should not determine the Alaska, should not determine the federal provisions."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2000.384,2003.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.368,2220.446,Is that in your brief?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2220.446,2222.753,"Yes Your Honor, it is at page 31."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2222.753,2223.768,Page 31?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2223.768,2224.89,Yes sir.
1969.185,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2340.892,2343.041,Does that come into your case?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2343.041,2343.986,Pardon me Your Honor?
1969.185,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2343.986,2346.287,The non-residency?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2346.287,2348.236,"Not as such, no."
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2493.009,2501.386,"That doesn't apply to people who are commercial fisherman in the sense of -- that they're trollers, is that right?"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2501.386,2503.754,"Your Honor, no it does not."
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2506.555,2507.714,As a commercial fishing?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2507.714,2516.967,"Yes Your Honor and I might point out right here that trolling is an entirely different type of fishing, it uses a different type of vessel."
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2521.996,2528.979,"I understand, to what percentage of the salmon caught in Alaska are caught by trollers and what by the net system?"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2528.979,2537.741,"Less than 5% are caught be trollers, 95% are caught by the net fisherman; this appears in the statistical reports of the State of Alaska."
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.741,2541.353,"As I understood, there's a different variety of salmon that was caught mainly by trolley?"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2541.353,2543.516,"Yes Your Honor, that is also true."
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2554.875,2556.813,"Which are they, the suck eye in the market?"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2556.813,2563.166,"Yes Your Honor, the principle, there is suck eye and pinks and shanks, the other three varieties."
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.166,2564.73,And they are caught by gill nets or what do you call?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2564.73,2567.37,They are caught by gill nets and by sane nets.
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2567.37,2568.091,Those kinds?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2568.091,2569.083,Yes Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.771,2852.9,"You have an additional element however, don't you in this case the -- that of experience."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2857.775,2861.552,"Well, I think the Cache (ph) case Your Honor as stated in the opinion."
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.078,2911.524,"At least to do, I have asserted here the interest of Alaska in having people, only people fish who were familiar with the waters and with the notices and with the weather and with the bottom, with the safety and experience --"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2911.524,2911.933,Your Honor --
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.933,2914.901,"That you did desire and remember, having the California case."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2914.901,2917.46,"Yes, that is so Your Honor."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2967.614,2974.909,"Well in the Cache case, wasn't the experience factor related directly to the safety of the harbors?"
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,2974.909,2991.534,"Yes, Your Honor it was and as I stated, they were -- there was a very -- there were very few people, they could be in any event employed as river boat pilots and they were officers of the state itself and it was a unique situation in that instance."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2991.534,3005.488,Is there any safety factor here except as -- or any factor in which the experience relates to safety here as distinguished from relating to conservation methods and practices?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3005.488,3010.517,Not as such as related to fishing in a particular area.
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3088.982,3090.292,They won't fish?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3090.292,3091.287,Pardon me Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3091.287,3093.85,You mean they won't fish.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3093.85,3094.383,No Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.953,3105.663,I know you keep saying that but you don't have to have their consent to go out and fish.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3105.663,3108.941,"To fish commercially with a net, one does."
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.941,3109.623,Why?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3109.623,3112.727,"Well, here let me give the example again in Bristol Bay."
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.727,3115.574,I know but the -- fish with the net should be troll.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3115.574,3117.27,You can't troll in Bristol Bay.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.349,3119.926,"Well you can troll, you just won't catch anything."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3119.926,3121.957,Yes I guess one could do that.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.442,3128.245,You keep saying you can't fish except with the consent of somebody to fish all you want to.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3128.245,3133.305,"Well, you can fish without catching fish if that's Your Honor but that to me is --"
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.305,3135.572,Is this only true in Bristol Bay?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3135.572,3135.887,No.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.211,3139.83,Well there are a lot of areas which is isn't true?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3139.83,3149.63,Yes Your Honor but this would eliminate one from fishing in the Bristol Bay area which is in itself at times as much as half the fish from the whole state.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.63,3152.49,Would you think that's enough to invalidate the entire statute?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3152.49,3158.651,I think Your Honor that the -- this applies also to each of the areas independently.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.038,3173.636,Well that's a different point.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3189.916,3193.916,"Your Honor, in some of the areas, one can fish for other fish besides salmon."
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.402,3196.717,What about Bristol Bay?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3196.717,3203.028,"In Bristol Bay to my knowledge, the salmon fishery would be the only fishery but I could not say that categorically."
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.312,3208.348,"Well, if we can't say it categorically, the state is saying, go ahead and fish commercially."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3226.219,3228.296,Well Your Honor the --
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.296,3230.167,Isn't that enough for the state?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3230.167,3232.25,"No, in my opinion, it is not Your Honor because --"
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.25,3237.367,"I know it is in your opinion, but it's only you because you disagree with the substantive judgment of the state."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3237.367,3250.29,"No, my feeling would be that if you have a man who has fished commercially in one area and he has shown his knowledge and he's fished there."
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.084,3285.772,You would say then that -- I suppose you would concede the state has the right to limit the number of people fishing in the area.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3285.772,3286.944,No I do not Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.952,3292.543,You mean that --
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3292.543,3294.653,No exclusive right of fishing.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.653,3297.263,It has no power to limit the number of fisherman in the area.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3297.263,3299.144,No I do not believe it does Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3308.501,3312.43,Isn't this the regulation indirectly doing that?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3312.43,3314.306,Of limiting the number of fishermen?
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3319.71,3321.202,Well that's our question.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3321.202,3327.075,"In answer to Mr. -- excuse me, I'd like to answer Mr. Justice White further if I may."
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3358.738,3381.456,"Well if you -- it's the way you put the issue -- certainly they can't do it -- they can't establish the exclusive right in certain people -- if those certain people are chosen irrationally such as only white people or only negroes or only people with over 6 feet tall or only people between the ages of 25, 26."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3395.581,3401.664,I would agree with that under the equal protection clause although not under the state exclusive right of fishery clause.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.776,3421.665,"Can you get me now to the state constitution, if the state wants to limit lake conservation, a step to preserve its fish, the only way it can do this is by limiting the hours of fishing or the number of fish that can be caught or something like that."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3421.665,3424.563,Yes Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.563,3428.931,"Which means that if enough the people came in, there just wouldn't be any commercial fishing."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3428.931,3429.024,No.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.024,3430.507,But they could never make a living.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3430.507,3432.41,Excuse me Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.449,3449.121,"Only the strong could survive, I suppose."
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3449.121,3450.89,It would be more or less on that basis.
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.985,3466.436,Excuse me.
1969.185,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3466.436,3470.003,Are salmon a dwindling resource in Alaska?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3470.003,3472.274,"No, I don't believe they are at this time Your Honor."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.607,3519.514,Now don't these questions which are -- that they've been bringing out a lot of factual matter suggest this is subject which are to be explored in a full scale evidentiary process?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3519.514,3531.567,"No Your Honor because the -- most of the facts, which I have stated are matters that are so well known in Alaska that they are a matter of judicial knowledge."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.567,3533.668,The first well known to us.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3533.668,3535.897,"Well, it is difficult."
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3624.598,3628.324,Did your complaint rest jurisdiction on both of those grounds?
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3628.324,3629.017,Yes Your Honor it does.
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3629.017,3630.896,Diversity as well as federal questions.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3630.896,3631.711,Yes Your Honor.
1969.185,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3631.711,3632.197,Thank you.
1969.185,1,38756,robert_boochever,,3632.197,3643.497,"So, we are there on both reasons, the statute is perfectly clear, there is no question of interpretation of the statute, no question but that these plaintiffs were denied the fishing right under the statute."
1969.185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3661.764,3667.416,"Thank you Mr. Boochever, your time is expired."
