2005.05-259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.896,We'll hear argument next in Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company v. White.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,7.308,9.489,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,92.353,95.475,"It has been endorsed by the EEOC, though."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,95.475,104.852,"Not... not that broad... no, not even the EEOC in its most aggressive interpretation, which obviously the United States has rejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying any."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.827,220.37,But 703 has the language and 704 doesn't.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,230.027,231.356,Right.
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.351,268.561,No.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,282.022,290.888,"--They could have said it that way, but it seems to me quite clear that Congress still intended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari materia."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.007,302.647,That's a curiosity.
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,303.499,308.462,"Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.541,370.342,"And the issue would be, I assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free lunch."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,370.342,373.033,--That would be... that would be the question.
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,373.033,388.645,"Well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that count as a violation?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,388.645,397.992,"Well, I will tell you, Justice Breyer, that the... at least one of the problems with that is that the EEOC's guidelines expressly state that that is not a claim that's actionable under section 704."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.992,406.326,"They say one lunch, but not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who gets left out is the person who filed a charge under title VII."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,423.316,427.631,"That would fit under the EEOC's definition, although I don't think it's an answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical--"
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,427.631,428.792,But it wouldn't fit under your--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,428.792,429.531,--that was talking the big power lunch.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.531,433.975,"--Under your definition, lunch is lunch, and so there would never be... there couldn't be--"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,433.975,436.569,"No, not under my... no, that's not necessarily the case, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.481,459.573,"--Well, does it or doesn't it?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,470.229,472.853,"And... and does it on a pervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.853,477.004,"--Does it once a week, and I'm not using any adjective to characterize it."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,478.396,485.062,"Well, I think you probably have a jury question at some point, depending on how long it went on for because it would become... it would become a pervasive practice."
2005.05-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.864,497.517,"Well, how excluding from the forklift forever or a year?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,499.419,509.226,"Well, the... the reason why that's not a problem is that there is no economic effect that attaches to not working on the forklift for a year or for 10 years."
2005.05-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.64,513.841,"Well, it has an effect on your back."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,513.841,518.001,But that was not the... but the... but she didn't get hired as a forklift operator.
2005.05-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.494,520.155,"Yes, but you've got a jury--"
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,520.155,521.705,"Okay, but if that argument is sound--"
2005.05-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.705,523.868,--you've got a jury finding here.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,526.99,530.704,"Well, there's... there's no question that there's a jury finding of retaliation."
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.276,550.007,"--Yes, but if your... if your argument is sound, Mr. Phillips, then... then any employer is well advised to define job categories by having one really nice job within the category and one really rotten job within the category."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,572.05,578.956,"Justice Souter, let me... in the first place, it's not a very practical hypothetical because, one, when you... when you define your job positions--"
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.956,588.053,"Well, isn't... isn't there a big difference between sitting on a seat and running a forklift and... and picking up steel rails with your bare hands?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,588.053,592.096,"--Well, one, she wasn't typically picking up steel rails with her bare hands."
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,615.07,616.172,"Okay, but--"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,616.172,618.333,"--then, it seems to me, there's a separate action."
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.885,626.319,"--Okay, but do you... do you agree that direct economic effect cannot be the only criterion here?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,626.319,627.891,"No, I don't think it can be the only criterion."
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.789,658.982,May I ask you this hypothetical?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,675.302,675.843,--Right.
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.533,679.526,That would be a violation?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,679.526,685.619,This Court held in... in Ellerth that those kinds of quid pro quos are... are subject to liability.
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.619,695.706,"So anytime there's an advance notice that you will... there will be some kind of action in response to a... a claim, that would be retaliation."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,695.706,696.868,"Right, because the employer... I mean, employers aren't going to--"
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.868,698.49,Even though it was not an adverse job action.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,698.49,698.851,--adopt that kind of a standard.
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.683,704.077,Even though it did not amount to... did not have any economic effect on the employee.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,704.077,713.163,"Well, in that... you know, in... under those circumstances, it seems to me that the standard is slightly different for quid pro quo violations than they are for simply tangible employment actions."
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.163,717.706,So a quid pro quo violation does not have to be an adverse employment action.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,717.706,723.418,"It... right, because the... there are... I mean, they are all adverse employment actions."
2005.05-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.671,732.674,It seems to me that... that interpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704 differently.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,732.674,732.975,--No.
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.782,743.243,But... but are you?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.935,781.611,"Well, I think that if... if you could certainly envision a circumstance... and again, this goes to the pervasiveness of it."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.759,798.33,Not... not by the--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,798.33,803.844,"--then at some point it becomes severe or pervasive in a way that... that, it would seem to me, would raise a jury trial issue."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.844,807.306,--And... and going to lunch is the conditions of employment.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,807.306,808.478,"Going to lunch once, no."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.478,808.718,Privilege.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,808.718,810.979,"Going to lunch twice, I'm sure not."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,817.574,819.247,But let's get the--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,819.247,833.444,"But... and that is why it's important, and it goes back to Justice Breyer's question, if I can go back to that for a second, because he asked about the D.C. Circuit's opinion, which, you know, of course, adopted the EEOC's now discredited theory of this case and, again, untethers 703 from 704."
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.136,836.427,Why?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,842.451,843.011,I suspect you could.
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.362,854.44,"--to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list under 703."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,886.111,886.78,Right.
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.78,888.633,It leaves it up to case by case.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,896.467,897.008,I'm sorry?
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.008,905.492,"I don't know one lunch from another often, but the... the EEOC might and... and so might a judge who hears evidence."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,905.492,906.063,Justice Breyer--
2005.05-259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.063,907.813,And that's the virtue of their standard.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,907.813,912.328,"--I mean, you can ask Mr. Garre what his view is with respect to the waiting on the position of the Solicitor General here."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.386,941.177,--What about the--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,941.177,943.958,"When you reach that standard, then you create a question of fact for the jury."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,943.958,966.723,"--what about the Seventh Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same character of work, except that the employee had flex time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just changed to... same job except it's got to be 9:00 to 5:00."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,970.806,982.604,"I doubt it actually, Justice Ginsburg, because I think typically mere inconveniences, even... even significant inconveniences, have traditionally been rejected as bases for taking an issue to the jury."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.604,990.1,Even though the jury has made a finding that the only reason that was done was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,990.1,995.764,"Justice Ginsburg, every one of these cases is based on the assumption that the only reason it was done is because of retaliation."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.764,995.994,Right.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,995.994,997.744,The lunch is in exactly the same position.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.744,998.375,But you would say that's outside--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,998.375,999.106,So that can't be the standard.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.106,1006.239,--that would be outside 704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for filing a complaint.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1017.679,1027.213,"Justice Ginsburg, if you adopt the other approach, what you say is that every change in assignments within the ordinary course of business is subject to claim by a plaintiff--"
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1027.213,1027.594,Not... not--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1027.594,1028.405,--in any situation--
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1028.405,1028.944,--not every--
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1028.944,1031.277,--where he or she thinks she's been retaliated against.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.277,1039.472,"--Not everyone, but only the ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person from filing the charge."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1041.843,1057.194,"And... and again, the problem with that legal standard, Justice Ginsburg, is it is not the same one that applies under section 703, and it seems to me there's no reason to provide greater protections under 704 to plaintiffs than you would have under section 703."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.194,1067.592,"Why wouldn't you say that Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the Meritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't... couldn't really do the job with this... with this new time assignment?"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1072.474,1072.864,Pervasive.
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.864,1078.038,--to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive work environment?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1078.038,1080.028,"I mean, to be sure, that's a possibility... that's a possible answer."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.028,1084.532,"--But that... this is a peculiar effect on one person, but for most people--"
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1084.532,1085.453,But it could be severe enough.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1085.453,1086.622,--most people it wouldn't matter.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1087.223,1090.445,"Right, but the question is, is it severe, I think, to that person?"
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.389,1093.928,--So you're changing your answer.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1098.742,1099.013,Right.
2005.05-259,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.524,1118.978,Isn't a change in the hours that a person works a change in the terms and conditions?
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1125.572,1139.251,"It... it probably depends on whether or not it was the expectation of the... of the employee that... that he or she would have a certain set of hours, because an awful lot of employees take a job with the expectation that they'll work any hours."
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.557,1213.509,So she was docked in her pay for 2 weeks.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1221.694,1225.548,Except that it was all... it was... it was reinstated.
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.548,1228.091,"Yes, well, they went back later and... and made up for their mistake."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1239.89,1240.441,There is official action.
2005.05-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.441,1246.462,"--it's not official just... just because it was decreed by a... you know, a track boss or something."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1251.206,1266.798,"Right, but then the question still remains, Justice Scalia, for it to be a tangible employment action, is it... is it available to the employer to cure, when the purpose of this entire statutory scheme is to avoid litigation and to provide informal mechanisms for protecting the rights of the employee."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.798,1267.275,But it didn't--
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1267.275,1268.006,"Yes, but if the employer--"
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.006,1268.687,--it didn't cure.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1272.46,1273.04,Right.
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.04,1274.362,Not just 2 weeks.
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1304.642,1309.564,"Justice Ginsburg, there still remains the core question of whether this is a tangible employment action."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.689,1322.644,"But when... when somebody is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it can get."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1330.918,1333.94,"But she did something about it, and it was corrected, Your Honor."
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1334.261,1334.641,But--
2005.05-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1334.641,1335.16,"--Yes, but--"
2005.05-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.16,1352.521,"--official action is... is different from... the problem with Ellerth was that if there's nothing formally that had been done, the employer... this... Ellerth was concerned with vicarious liability, nothing official."
2005.05-259,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1360.088,1360.608,--To be sure.
2005.05-259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1365.952,1366.873,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1374.908,1377.432,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.802,1426.954,"Counsel, in... in the absence of any suggestion that the collective bargaining process is also infected with sex discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to give some basis to the job descriptions?"
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1443.813,1452.87,"Well, I think the problem that Justice Souter identified, I believe, where an employer or even a collective bargaining agreement could identify categories that had so many different responsibilities--"
2005.05-259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1452.87,1455.332,"Well, but the difference there is that's an employer unilaterally."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1462.827,1467.629,"--Here, what we know and what the jury found... and this is actually... it's important to keep in mind."
2005.05-259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.902,1512.488,Doesn't your approach require an employer to keep shuffling the employees around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession of particular types of job responsibilities?
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1512.488,1513.48,--I don't think so.
2005.05-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.941,1532.172,No.
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1538.095,1539.046,"Well, that... that--"
2005.05-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.046,1546.24,That would have been impossible here because there was no one in that entire unit who could operate a forklift except this one employee.
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1546.24,1546.651,--That's right.
2005.05-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.936,1560.471,"Is it... is it... was it in this category, this track category?"
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1569.628,1572.359,"--There was testimony to that effect, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.279,1600.556,"With respect to the suspension, what... what if she had been... during the process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay on the job with pay?"
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1613.956,1619.951,"Well, I think most courts have held that where you have suspension with pay, then you don't have material adverse employment action."
2005.05-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.186,1693.626,I don't know if that hurts you or helps you.
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1713.832,1714.549,"--Well, we--"
2005.05-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.549,1717.631,"You're telling me it does make sense, that we've done it in other areas."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1717.631,1727.219,"--With respect, what I'm telling you is that Congress has determined in some areas it may be important to have a broader provision protecting against intimidation and coercion."
2005.05-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.074,1749.104,"Does your test cover the person who's a former employee who complained under title VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't given one for retaliation... as retaliation for having complained under title VII?"
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1749.104,1749.795,"It does, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1761.052,1762.031,Well--
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1762.031,1765.724,"--the reasonably likely to deter test that you referred to, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.314,1796.304,"--It's not... it's not... the... the words of the statute that I think are relevant is it... is it... you can't discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1829.775,1833.669,"Well, again, we think Congress knows how to write that statute, and it does it differently."
2005.05-259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.693,1853.705,"Well, I'd be curious."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1871.257,1872.619,Two... two points with respect to that.
2005.05-259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1913.214,1919.037,But if 704 doesn't incorporate 703 why would the... the EEOC test be the next best test?
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1924.64,1925.511,--That's... that's true.
2005.05-259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1932.905,1947.916,"Well, Congress could have... could have said... could have thought not only do we not want people who... who file complaints not to suffer those things that would deter a reasonable person from filing a complaint, but we just don't want them to suffer at all for having engaged in this protected activity."
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1947.916,1948.998,That's possible.
2005.05-259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1949.418,1955.301,What... what basis would there be for deciding that Congress had one policy objective as opposed to the other there?
2005.05-259,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1955.301,1964.177,--We think that the balance that Congress struck in title VII was from... between deterring all forms of discrimination and not... not allowing every employee grievance to become a Federal court case.
2005.05-259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.316,1979.057,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,1986.093,1988.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2025.219,2031.003,What if she'd been operating the forklift for only a week and then she was reassigned?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2034.914,2048.143,"With respect to the motivation, if there... if there was a motivation, a retaliatory motivation, according to the proper reading of 704, it would be because what that aims at is motivation."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.195,2199.633,"I'm... I'm a supervisor, and the employee files a complaint against me as a supervisor."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2218.193,2219.705,"No, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.705,2220.376,I'm not?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2222.167,2222.497,No.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.972,2232.202,Sort of like taking her to lunch.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2232.202,2242.871,"If it's... if it's a blue collar worker and it's... it's not part of their responsibility and they sometimes eat together in the lunchroom or not, that would not be."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.319,2251.175,"Now, you say it... it has to be part of my... it doesn't have to relate to her terms and conditions of employment, you say--"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2251.175,2251.796,--No--
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.796,2253.536,--because it's not the same as 703.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2258.271,2263.173,--There are situations where it would be broader than 703.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.277,2319.12,"Yes, I worry about that, as... as varied as the human imagination."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2330.907,2332.008,--Your Honor--
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.008,2341.543,"What... what is your criterion that is going to stop every little thing from... from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not saying good morning to this employee?"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2341.543,2343.506,--There are several things that are built into the statute.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.66,2350.331,"Yes, I understand that."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2359.605,2368.19,"--Plus, you always have to show causation, and many, many cases are dismissed on the basis of summary judgment, even termination cases on the basis of causation."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.19,2368.811,I'll give you causation.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2382.041,2388.885,"Your Honor, both the EEOC test, as well as our test, is one based upon a reasonable person under all of the circumstances."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.726,2393.809,A reasonable person would what... would what?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2393.809,2396.641,"--Under our standard, it would be--"
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.641,2398.352,A reasonable person would consider it to be?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2398.352,2399.473,--Adverse.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.473,2400.492,Adverse.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2400.492,2404.856,If it was... if it was unfavorable to the plaintiff.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.854,2425.483,Why is the EEOC standard any more based in the text of the statute than... than the standard proposed by your adversary here?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2425.483,2429.082,--That's why we proposed one that's based with what the statute means.
2005.05-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2451.748,2462.676,"You won on the basis of the standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not your standard and not the EEOC standard."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2492.936,2495.908,"Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly correct."
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2512.136,2522.224,"Counsel, you said earlier that the act... one of the protections against trivial charges was that the act had to be the act of the employer."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2536.964,2542.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, I want to answer one question related to that."
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2552.034,2555.056,"What does that mean, it was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement?"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2559.05,2562.302,--It was not a defined job within the collective bargaining agreement.
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.202,2665.518,"Your position is that it would be an... it would be a covered employment action even if none of that were true, she didn't lose pay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the initiation of the disciplinary action."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2668.782,2674.825,"Well, under these facts, it was sufficiently adverse because she lost pay."
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2717.084,2720.835,Other than eligibility for punitive damages.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2720.835,2725.53,"--Well, assuming that you could get through the hurdles."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.052,2834.801,"Suppose... suppose I disagree with you as to the standard, that is, I think 704 and 703 both require something related to the employment."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2850.161,2864.791,"Your Honor, if... if you look at... if you look at the joint appendix at page 63, the trial judge actually instructed the court... instructed the jury, listing six factors."
2005.05-259,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2918.617,2922.049,What does... what does material mean?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2922.049,2924.751,"That's a great question, and we--"
2005.05-259,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2946.396,2951.449,"Well, do... do you think it does anything more than just eliminate clearly de minimis action?"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2951.449,2951.98,--I'm sorry.
2005.05-259,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2952.53,2962.117,Do... do you think the... the materially modifier here does anything other than eliminate obviously de minimis behavior on the part of the employer?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,2962.117,2964.369,--I don't think it does anything other than that.
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3015.383,3029.801,"What... what if she operated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the other 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and... and the shift was now she does... operates the forklift 2 out of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail ties?"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3031.213,3037.729,That probably would not... I probably could not convince a jury that that was materially adverse.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.999,3042.552,"--Well, that isn't the test, I mean, whether you can convince a jury."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3073.052,3078.935,--I acknowledge and the facts... and the Sixth Circuit unanimously affirmed that... that the facts were there.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.087,3097.108,"Okay, but that... that is at least what... what's before us here, that if... if we go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude, in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could find."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3100.869,3101.67,--Yes.
2005.05-259,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.536,3201.445,"Am I right in thinking... I just want to clarify this... that in the circuit court, they applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a standard that sounds a lot like Ellerth, the Kocsis, or whatever it is?"
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3217.596,3218.017,--That's--
2005.05-259,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.017,3219.387,And you won under the toughest standard.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3219.387,3220.398,"--That's correct, a very tough standard."
2005.05-259,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.398,3222.349,"So in a sense, you have nowhere to go but up."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3222.99,3223.951,Exactly right.
2005.05-259,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3229.555,3230.873,You don't care what standard--
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3230.873,3231.915,And I don't care what standard it is.
2005.05-259,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3231.915,3232.235,--for this case.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3232.235,3233.995,I don't care what the standard is for this case.
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.602,3282.568,"Yes, and the other argument is that if you don't do it, there's no way to... to get a case dismissed before it goes to a jury."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3287.741,3295.936,"Justice Scalia, every claim would not be a jury trial because you're going to have to show the causation issues and damages issues."
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.367,3298.838,But the triviality issue would be out of the case.
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3302.972,3304.552,"--No, Your Honor, that's not what I want--"
2005.05-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.552,3306.425,"Well, then we have to have some per se rules."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3306.425,3319.304,"--Well, the... the rule that you could apply that would not have per se rules and would ferret out any kind of... of trivial matters would be the EEOC standard with a de minimis rule."
2005.05-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3319.304,3323.168,Don't you want us to exclude this ultimate employment decision?
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3334.144,3335.115,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.629,3347.862,"So for you to win to preserve your Sixth Circuit victory, that would have to be ruled out."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3347.862,3368.328,"The Court should find that that's not applicable and it's not appropriate under title VII and... and that would be necessary for us to prevail, even though the defendant did not argue ultimate employment action standard at the trial level, didn't ask for such an instruction, didn't raise that issue until subsequent to the... this."
2005.05-259,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.594,3471.706,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-259,2,20790,donald_a_donati,,3471.706,3472.373,Thank you.
