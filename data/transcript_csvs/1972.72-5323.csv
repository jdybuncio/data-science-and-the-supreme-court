1972.72-5323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.141,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-5323, Keeble against the United States."
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,25.521,27.898,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-5323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.623,370.013,"Mr. Meierhenry, let me go back just a minute in your argument."
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,379.202,379.907,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,396.468,403.348,"Mr. Meierhenry, you are not attacking the statute on constitutional grounds, are you?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,403.348,424.791,"Your Honor, I am if, the first point, if this Court should find that I am incorrect and there is no jurisdiction to give a lesser included offense instructions then it is the petitioner's contention that 18 U.S.C. 1153 as applied, meaning not giving a lesser included offense instruction, it violates due process."
1972.72-5323,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,430.137,433.268,I wonder why you don’t attack it constitutionally head on.
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,437.947,438.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.282,457.887,But isn’t it what could be a violation for due process only because it denies something in the equal protection?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,457.887,460.023,"Yes, Your Honor on the due process --"
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.023,464.759,And otherwise it’s not -- it's just kind of treat some people different?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,464.759,470.436,"Yes, Your Honor and as I’ll point out again on the due process part, the government cites at very recent case."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.436,473.873,"Well if it is, would that be the basis for your due process argument?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,473.873,480.225,My basis is that an Indian person being United States citizen is treated differently that they have --
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.225,484.674,It is the federal equal protection and due process?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,484.674,485.481,Yes Your Honor.
1972.72-5323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.481,494.098,You don’t claim any infirmity in the statute other than if it is construed to preclude the lesser included offense instruction?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,494.098,524.829,"My view Your Honor is that, that if this Court agrees with me on point one and said that there is jurisdiction and you read the statute this original Act of 1885, saying that when Congress wrote that, saying that Indians would be tried in the same manner in the same courts in effect like everyone else, if you agree on that point, we may not ever get to the due process part of in this particular case, looking at this particular case."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.344,544.372,"There’s two ways of hearing it, isn’t there?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,553.361,567.867,"That is true Your Honor, as this is Court is held in Sansone versus United States they talk about it as an entitlement and the Federal Courts have always or for sometime ruled that it is there, not be given."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.867,572.046,"That isn't an equal protection, that's a substitute --"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,572.046,574.953,"That would be a substitute, Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,577.357,580.008,You mean the substitute because of the rule?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,580.008,583.445,"Well, I say that there’s been a violation of due process for two reasons."
1972.72-5323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.445,591.927,Well can you argue that the 31 (c) under the rule entitles you to instruction anyway?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,591.927,593.391,"Yes, I have in my brief Your Honor --"
1972.72-5323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,593.391,601.597,"And then you say, and then if it’s not to be certainly on its face, it would appear to entitle you to it, wouldn’t it?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,606.712,625.172,"Because it is a racial classification, and as the government points out that the short answer to my contention is that the clause of Section 3242 to which petitioner points, simply provides that ordinary trial procedures apply in Indian cases is exactly what we’re contending here."
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.054,943.511,"And in this case which one of those three was it, Indian against Indian?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,943.511,945.289,It was Indian against Indian.
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.066,950.848,"And that’s the only reason in this case, that this case was under the Assimilative Crime Act that you’re telling us?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,950.848,961.157,"Well, the wording in 18 U.S.C. 1153, Mr. Justice is, they have changed it and it is Indian or any other person."
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,971.29,977.616,"Under the Assimilative Crimes Act, because he wouldn't -- here this 1153 applies only to an Indian defendant?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,977.616,977.835,Right.
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.835,980.724,When the man charged is an Indian?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,980.724,981.645,That is correct Your Honor.
1972.72-5323,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,981.645,1005.872,"Mr. Meierhenry, in the government’s brief reference is made to the federal statute having to do with assault upon a federal officer in the performance of his duties, 18 U.S.C. 111 and the suggestion is that this is comparable and that there no lesser included offense for simple assault is available to the defendant."
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1007.365,1008.452,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.226,1177.165,Arguably in his advantage?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1177.165,1178.542,It could’ve been You Honor.
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.818,1183.424,"It’s only a hindsight, isn’t it?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1183.424,1189.39,"Well, this is where the government starts arguing in their brief along that line that there’s --"
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.39,1191.629,As long as that (Inaudible)?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1191.629,1196.685,"In this particular case, I don’t know Your Honor, because I cannot tell what --"
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.685,1199.866,You mean because you don’t know it’s unconstitutional?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1199.866,1211.762,"No I’m saying it’s unconstitutional no matter what would’ve happened, but I’m saying that in this particular case, I don’t think that it would’ve been to his benefit or to his detriment not to have it."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.973,1215.962,"To treat him differently, right?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1215.962,1218.772,-- to treat him differently.
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.433,1238.377,"Or you could say I suppose that this whole scheme of things splitting up whatever the 13 crimes that all are appropriate (Inaudible), is unconstitutional, because it does treat Indians different from others."
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1238.377,1241.451,I say that the whole scheme could be unconstitutional.
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.451,1246.875,"Well, I would think a fortiori it would be at this stage?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1246.875,1248.443,Well perhaps it is.
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.422,1250.36,But you could also argue if you didn’t --
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1250.36,1251.595,"Maybe 12, Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.595,1260.246,If we didn’t have this statute you’d be treating Indians differently because they’d be tried in tribal courts and other people would be tried in the United States District Courts?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1260.246,1261.604,If you did not have this statute?
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.604,1265.318,"Yes, so it’s unconstitutional if you have it, it is unconstitutional if you don’t have it?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1265.318,1282.722,"Well, in this particular case you would bounce from one federal jurisdiction into or one federal court into another, because we have a CFR court, which is the judges are federal government employee, the police officer is federal government employee, the jail is federal government, the food they feed the prisoners is federal government."
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.509,1294.361,What if the charge here had been attempted assault?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1294.361,1304.117,Attempted assault would not be covered by the Major Crimes Act and would therefore be a tribal crime.
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1304.117,1305.782,So what’s CFR?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1305.782,1308.458,Code of Federal Regulations which is --
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.458,1310.204,But what kind of a court is the CFR court?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1310.204,1312.804,Well it’s a dubious court to say the least.
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.092,1318.282,But would this be the tribal court?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1318.282,1320.643,This is a tribal court in this factual situation.
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.448,1349.694,It’s a CFR court?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1349.694,1354.578,"It’s a CFR, a court for a code of Indian offenses and I would like to point out --"
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.578,1357.293,It is like a treble denial -–
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1357.293,1361.227,"Well, the government says this is a fair and effective administration of justice."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.224,1371.076,"Well, you got reorganization act Indian, you got CFR Indians -–"
1972.72-5323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.076,1371.901,"Yes, you got Indians."
1972.72-5323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.901,1376.306,If you are to just point at the Indians (Inaudible) Major Crimes Act?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1376.306,1382.046,"And you’ve also got situations in states where there is state jurisdiction as well, there’s a number of them."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.046,1388.815,Well in this particular petition that was subject to what kind of a tribal court?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1388.815,1396.508,"It is Mr. Justice, it’s a court of Indian offenses, a federally subsidized court."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1435.495,1439.27,And then the tribe could change that and have their own trial court?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1439.27,1441.598,"They could, if they so wish Your Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1441.598,1446.294,But if they don’t then they automatically get this or what?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1446.294,1457.045,"Yes, this is to fill the void until a tribe decides it wants its own laws or its own code and it varies."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1479.273,1481.206,And who are the judges?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1481.206,1487.878,The judges are most commonly lay persons hired by the Department of Interior.
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1494.256,1500.349,What difference is that as it is today and what it was in 1880?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1500.349,1504.193,"In some areas not a great deal, You Honor."
1972.72-5323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.12,1554.657,Of course the non-Indian would be subject in some circumstances to trial in federal court in one city and state court in another city arising out of the same transaction which an Indian wouldn’t?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1554.657,1556.656,"Yes, I recognize that."
1972.72-5323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.812,1566.419,Where -- which an Indian in this particular tribe situation would not be as I understand it.
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1573.222,1581.162,No except on certain sanitary regulations which is been -- which the United States government has given the jurisdiction to the state for certain things like --
1972.72-5323,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1581.162,1583.141,Where in the state is this reservation?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1583.141,1586.448,"This state is south Pierre, South Dakota, approximately 60 miles."
1972.72-5323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.817,1600.601,And is Rosebud also --
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1600.601,1602.061,East of --
1972.72-5323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.061,1603.248,-- Rosebud in that area too?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1603.248,1605.127,It’s in Western South Dakota as well.
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.127,1622.709,"Well, suppose on the site where this crime was committed there was a nonresident Indian from Washington and me from Washington and we committed a crime, would the Indian be tried any different from me than nonresident Indian?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1622.709,1623.387,No.
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1631.618,1633.828,"But, mines a nonresident."
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1633.828,1634.153,Pardon me?
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.153,1636.553,It doesn’t apply to nonresident Indian?
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1636.553,1638.64,"All Indians, all Indians no matter where."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1638.64,1643.876,"So then if the two of us go out there and commit a crime, the Indian gets a different trail than the one I get?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1643.876,1648.174,"Yes, you would be tried under the Assimilative Crimes Act because you’re non-Indian."
1972.72-5323,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1655.234,1660.368,"Well, you won’t mind if I ask the Solicitor General that same question, will you?"
1972.72-5323,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1660.368,1662.231,No sir.
1972.72-5323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.21,1674.759,Mr. Stone?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1674.759,1679.772,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.815,1705.201,Have you any idea how many cases we have this term Mr. Stone?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1705.201,1708.031,"I recognize there were countless this morning with Mr. Justice Brennan, I --"
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1708.031,1711.064,As many of those as we’ve had three-judge court appeals.
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1711.064,1715.335,Indeed I understand that and it’s a terribly complex problem.
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.837,1734.33,How about the non-residents?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1743.237,1752.951,There’s no question Mr. Justice Marshall that they get a different trial with respect to the availability of a lesser included offense charge and it is that discrepancy which I claim to deal with in the course of this argument.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1752.951,1759.033,"On the other hand, on the other hand if the discrimination could work the other way, if --"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1759.033,1760.327,Indeed it could.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.327,1772.104,"-- if Justice Marshall and his Indian friend go out to Indian country and both commit the same crime if it is not a crime, if it is one of the 13 listed here."
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1772.104,1775.153,And then they cannot be tried in the federal court and are tried only in the tribal court.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.153,1777.333,And yet Justice Marshall would be tried in the federal court?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1777.333,1778.09,No.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1778.09,1779.395,"In the state court, that is."
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1779.395,1781.003,"That’s right, there are --"
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.003,1782.711,"Well, under the federal court only there’s so many felony concepts."
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1782.711,1790.741,"There are myriad of splits Mr. Justice Stewart, between the federal court, the state court and the tribal court and they do without question depend on racial categorizations, there’s no question on that."
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.741,1793.043,"Right, of the defendant of the person charged?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1793.043,1794.802,That's right and with the victim as well.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.802,1795.211,And sometimes --
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1795.211,1799.728,And sometimes with respect to the victim and there is a myriad of very complicated jurisdictional allocations.
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.549,1820.269,"But if the Indian resident break on it, all I have to do is say I got to drop an Indian blood then I get that, don't I?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1820.269,1822.489,Well that’s a complicated question Mr. Justice Marshall.
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.509,2216.886,"Before you get into that Mr. Stone, I’m having trouble, some problem with the record trying to reconcile the charge with the statute."
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2250.935,2251.514,"Yes, I have two --"
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.514,2253.373,"Now, can you clear that up for me?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2253.373,2256.625,"This is a certainly a problem Mr. Justice Burger, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.229,2354.302,"But we do have a hiatus here between the statutory base, the allegation of the indictment, you of course concede that, don’t you?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2354.302,2356.056,I’m sorry I don’t understand the Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.056,2371.625,"The discrepancy here, the statutory authority deals with assault with resulting in great bodily harm, serious bodily harm and the indictment was assault with intent?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2371.625,2383.132,"That’s right, because that is the way the state statute is defined but as I say, it is not at all clear that the state statute is ever applicable except where in fact the harm resulted."
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.109,2393.457,Without intent?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2393.457,2416.675,"-- without the requisite intent and it simply intend to cause assault at all might arguably be sufficient to carry forward even if no bodily harm were intended but great bodily harm resulted, but on the context of this case, I do not think the issue was raised, not only because it has been raised below but because everybody’s total agreement not only great bodily, but death as a result of this serious incidents."
1972.72-5323,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2416.675,2420.914,"If resulted as I understand to make this over-exposure, lay out on the ground all night?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2420.914,2428.506,"Well, that’s disputed in the record but at least it was, it is undisputed that the victim walked out in pretty terrible shape, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2428.506,2429.439,And died the next morning.
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2429.439,2433.037,And died the next morning and if there was some doubt whether he died of the injuries of over-exposure.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.503,2469.245,"He was tried for assaulting with intent, that’s what he was charged with, that was he was tried for?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2469.245,2474.808,That’s right which adds it incidentally in element that is not necessarily present in the federal crime.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.808,2475.832,"Oh, really?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2475.832,2483.531,"The intent to cause great bodily harm is not necessarily present in the federal list in 18 U.S.C. 1153, only the actual causing."
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2496.409,2499.461,You mean you have to show only assault resulting in bodily harm?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2499.461,2506.538,"Yes, that’s right, intent to assault which would include some sort of intent to commit the assault but not a specific intent resulting in great bodily harm."
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2506.538,2519.161,"Well, I suppose an example of that would be if someone simply slapped the face of another person and that resulted in displacing or detaching a retina which is grave, you’d have that situation, wouldn’t you?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2519.161,2520.828,"You could, you could have that situation."
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2520.828,2522.13,You don’t think we need to worry about that?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2522.13,2525.797,"But I don’t think if it’s just not present in this case, excuse me?"
1972.72-5323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.797,2528.287,You think it because it’s a limited grant of certiorari?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2528.287,2562.781,"Well yes, because that raises a problem, Mr. Justice Rehnquist because the grant is worded in terms of the constitutional question and I suppose we can’t argue that some preliminary threshold statutory question cannot be considered here, that the Court need decide the constitutional question, absent some satisfactory determination of the threshold questions that would set that up for which reason we have not objected for example to the statutory argument that the lesser included defense charge is constructively provided in 18 U.S.C. 1153 which the petitioner raises."
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.781,2571.763,Let’s assume that when he was indicted for something clearly not within the reach of the federal statute?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2571.763,2576.186,Then he clearly would not properly have been tried in the federal court at all.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.186,2586.018,And don’t you think we have to decide whether this crime is within the framework of the federal statute?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2586.018,2587.159,I think you do have to --
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.159,2590.296,"Well, how can we put it aside maybe for some other case?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2590.296,2600.939,"I think you only have to leave it for some other case where in fact, the element of great bodily harm is not present, Mr. Justice White."
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.924,2617.421,What did the instruction say?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2618.763,2619.38,"Yes, it was a jury trial."
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.38,2620.676,What did the instruction say?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2620.676,2624.996,The instructions deal with the element of intent and do not specifically require a finding of actual harm --
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.996,2627.393,(Inaudible)
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2627.393,2636.866,But that is because the sole defense raised that the trial was with respect to the issue of intent and it was admitted throughout the trial that great bodily harm had occurred.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.555,2657.553,"Well, I gather your argument is that the government had only to prove really to bring itself within the statute an assault and resulting bodily harm and that in fact you showed that the burden of proving intent to inflict and therefore he got a better break than he was entitled to on the statute?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2657.553,2664.517,We wouldn’t necessarily say that he got a better break but that he was put to no advantage because the government proved with no possible rebuttal.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.517,2669.148,The only thing is one element at the time was never submitted in the jury?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2669.148,2701.358,"Well, I have no further answer to that, Mr. Justice White except for the fact I think a reading of this record and attention to both petitioners charged to himself, requested to charge himself and to the evidence presented would reveal no conceivable question about that and I recognize the difficulty of assuming a directed verdict type of assumption in the criminal context, but I think that the presence of great bodily harm is as conclusively present and undisputed in the context that this case as it could possibly be."
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.358,2706.639,And I thought that your footnote 2 on page 4 dealt with this question?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2706.639,2726.594,"Well, it deals with it by a citation, Mr. Justice Stewart of the Nordelo case which implies that when in a criminal context generally, the federal government incorporates a state definition of a crime that it really only incorporates the substantive definition and not necessarily the labels."
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.594,2727.028,Right.
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2727.028,2733.265,I have some question as to how far we can take that in this case to the extent that there really is an underlying substantive definitional problem.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.903,2748.753,You cite Nordelo and (Inaudible)?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2748.753,2748.908,That’s right.
1972.72-5323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.908,2764.565,"And this question would involve the construing the meaning of the last full paragraph of 18 U.S.C. 1153, but I thought this issue isn’t here since you point out there’s no question about the fact of great bodily harm?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2764.565,2777.589,"I think that is right, but I have some, at least slight reluctance to answer to I believe to Mr. Justice White’s suggestion that the element, there’s no question about it, but then it wasn’t submitted to the jury and I recognize that it is difficult to."
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.589,2788.48,And the judge explained to the jury that he wasn’t charged with beating him to death or even cause him serious?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2788.48,2795.351,I don’t think he charges that he wasn't -- he doesn’t specifically say that he is not charged with causing serious injuries as he isn’t charged with intent to kill.
1972.72-5323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.351,2802.114,Your contention there is no intention and no contest by the government that the beating in question is ultimate death of the victim.
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2819.801,2839.252,"Well, I would submit with all deference that I have no further response to that question except that I think that the difficulty which is raised here might be a difficulty in another, but it is not a difficulty in this case and ought not to deter this Court from reaching the merits of the underlying issue that’s presented."
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.121,3059.581,All of this tiptoeing had nothing to do with Indians at all?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3059.581,3061.828,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I’m sorry but I don’t understand that?"
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.828,3064.687,I said they tiptoed in this assimilative statute --
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3064.687,3067.992,"No, no not the assimilative statute, in the Major Crimes Act."
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.941,3081.61,"Well then I ask the question, were the Indians considered on the assimilated crime statute?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3081.61,3083.438,I’m sorry I don’t understand the question?
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.438,3091.282,"Well, was this type of case considered on when you have the assimilated crimes statute which allows the states to move, right?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3101.132,3115.898,"Well, I assume that what those statutes were enacted with regard to the question of what jurisdiction should be left in what places and to the extent that they involved Indians, they involved consideration of what crime should be left to the Indian courts."
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3129.622,3131.147,"That’s what I was talking about, the major --"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3131.147,3131.649,That’s right.
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3243.597,3244.326,Is this notion of --
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3244.326,3247.74,-- Restitution rather than on retribution and --
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3247.74,3259.566,"Is this an argument Mr. Stone really that you can’t ever get an equal protection, due process violation in such a --"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3259.566,3260.065,No.
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3265.684,3266.943,How far do you go then?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3266.943,3292.206,"Well in this case, I go -- I think we go not very far at all because I think the discrepancy between which we deal with here, which is that a lesser included offense charge is available to an Indian -- to a non-Indian defendant in this case, but not to an Indian defendant is a very minor price to pay for upholding the very major rationale that Congress has consistently reinforced of preserving tribal sovereignty for number of reasons."
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3416.013,3421.55,"Now, that raises all kinds of body problems and Barkus problems, it never goes, does it?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3421.55,3426.644,"Oh, as to whether he can be tried in this -- I think it doesn’t Mr. Justice Brennan."
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3433.476,3434.569,Maybe it’s a separate sovereignty?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3434.569,3436.305,"Separate sovereignty and we would argue that they are, but let me --"
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3436.305,3439.07,"The Indians at least to that extent sovereign, are they?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3439.07,3441.162,"That’s right and well, and --"
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3441.162,3445.463,"It is -- I forgot, don’t we have that issue in some case?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3445.463,3446.071,Excuse me?
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3446.071,3447.584,Don’t we have that issue in some case as them?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3447.584,3450.308,It’s been presented on certiorari and certiorari has been denied.
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3450.308,3451.016,Is that it?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3451.016,3454.529,"And in the case that it was presented, it was not necessarily an issue."
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3463.701,3467.361,"I mean that these are CFR, these aren’t sovereign Indians either, are they?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3467.361,3467.857,That --
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3467.857,3469.915,Doesn't that compensate the body?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3469.915,3471.426,I don’t think so Mr. Justice Brennan.
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3486.604,3499.926,"How do you get around the individual Constitutional right asserted by individual in this Court by answering it before the greatest good for the greatest number, we could get it."
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3499.926,3508.441,I answer it as I would in any context Mr. Justice Marshall that the discrimination is only unconstitutional insofar as it is invidious rationally.
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3511.53,3523.651,"Is it based on anything other than the fact that this man, the petition on this case, is it based on anything other than the fact that he is an Indian, spelled Indian?"
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3523.651,3524.936,Absolutely not Mr. Justice Marshall --
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3524.936,3525.255,Is there anything else?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3525.255,3528.786,-- but neither is the entire federal regulatory scheme governing Indians.
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3528.786,3531.268,But we’re only talking about this one case?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3531.268,3533.313,"I don’t think you can do that Mr. Justice Marshall, with all respect."
1972.72-5323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3533.313,3535.488,We can’t talk about the one case?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3535.488,3544.086,"I don’t think you can isolate one case and say, here, it is speculative that he may have suffered some sort of harm as a result to this -- of this classification."
1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3622.075,3628.899,"Well, I suppose though that one believed the same transaction under the same offense test might reach different conclusion?"

1972.72-5323,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3630.151,3633.055,Though I believe I the same transaction test you can know?
1972.72-5323,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,3633.055,3638.01,That would be -- in that case I am must rely on the argument of separate sovereignties.
1972.72-5323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3703.499,3713.531,"Mr. Meierhenry, if you need a little more time than your remaining two minutes, we will extend your time here."
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3713.531,3724.525,"Your Honor, it’s unfortunate that the petitioner’s taken the case this far and the United States government has still not gotten all of its forces together and decided between what’s going on in Washington and what’s going on in South Dakota."
1972.72-5323,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3816.053,3817.974,"Well, what do you think they want to raise it?"
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3817.974,3821.395,"Your Honor, this is the first trial I ever had and I didn’t see it."
1972.72-5323,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3821.395,3830.724,"Because that this isn’t -- it is may not -- you may have been tried for a crime that you had no authority to charge, right?"
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3830.724,3831.974,That could be Your Honor.
1972.72-5323,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3863.827,3867.227,"What was that, what would then the penalty on the lesser included offense?"
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3867.227,3868.404,"Well, there’s a number of them."
1972.72-5323,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3874.458,3874.95,That’s the six months.
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3874.95,3875.839,-- six months.
1972.72-5323,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3879.076,3904.287,"What if the instruction you asked was to be instructed on a crime that really wasn’t the only crime that should have been tried under the Major Crimes Act, you’re making this -- you really are making the same argument on the lesser included offense as you would have been if you said dismiss the indictment."
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3906.076,3918.472,"Yes, Your Honor, I would also point out that I have argued that, that the cases that the government have cited since then by District Courts in our district, have used those."

1972.72-5323,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4046.403,4054.877,"Mr. Meierhenry, you were not appointed by the Court in the conventional way here, but representing your legal services in South Dakota you volunteered."
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4054.877,4055.311,Yes.
1972.72-5323,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4055.311,4061.555,"And on behalf of the Court, I want to thank you for your assistance to the Court and of course the assistance to your client."
1972.72-5323,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4061.555,4066.139,"Well, Your Honor, I also thank you for letting me appear since I don’t qualify as a member of the Supreme Court Bar."
