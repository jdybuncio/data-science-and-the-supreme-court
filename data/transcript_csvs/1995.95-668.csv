1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.318,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-668, Auciello Iron Works, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,17.053,20.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.092,157.093,"Mr.... Krischer, is it?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,158.866,159.256,O'Reilly.
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.256,171.944,--Are you making any claim here that the union in fact lacked majority support at the time the union accepted the offer?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,171.944,175.576,"Justice O'Connor, I have been making that claim not only today but for the last 8 years."
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.179,182.361,"Is that issue in front of us, do you think, properly?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,182.361,186.642,"--I believe it is, Your Honor, particularly, I--"
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.642,191.196,"Did the board deal with the case in that posture, or not?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,202.223,204.875,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe you have both issues before you."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.544,222.166,There may be any number of facts in the case that are not before us.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,235.325,237.446,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.446,241.65,I don't see that as raising the question in fact as to whether the union had lost its majority status.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,241.65,249.153,"Well, of course, in fact that was... Mr. Chief Justice, that was raised in our original answer to the complaint 8 years ago at the labor board."
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.214,274.559,"Well, the issues are quite different, possibly, and I wonder if we aren't bound by how the question is presented in your petition for certiorari."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,274.559,284.066,"--I think the issues may vary, but I... in this particular case I think they're so closely intertwined that they can be treated as one and the same."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.398,325.083,"And is that the board rule, that even if you were to show unquestionably, never mind good faith doubt, that the union no longer had majority status, that the same result would ensue?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,325.083,343.506,"No, I think the only difference, Justice Scalia, would be if we, the employer, had raised and proved... established at the trial level that we had a good faith doubt, it would then be incumbent upon general counsel to establish that in fact the union had maintained a majority--"
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.506,344.908,But I'm asking you what the board rule is.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,358.434,370.623,"--No, as I understand the board decision, they would... decisions, they would take the position that if we had established under the facts of this case actual loss of majority, or at least my friends at the--"
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.623,370.943,Right.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,370.943,373.145,--AFL-CIO in their amicus brief said that would be enough.
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.806,376.487,Okay.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,376.487,388.074,"--its position with regard to whether or not the actual loss of majority would have entitled us, under the facts of this case, to send... fire back that reply telegram disavowing any further obligations--"
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.074,390.866,"So it is a separate question, then, and--"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,390.866,396.469,"--I suspect it is, but we feel the result would be the same under both scenarios."
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.469,411.209,"--Mr. O'Reilly, would you... my understanding was that your friends at the AFL-CIO took the position, but there's only one way to establish that the union has lost its majority, and that is through a secret ballot."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,411.209,447.694,"They... Justice Ginsburg, they took the same position, of course, and filed an almost identical brief in the Curtin Matheson case, saying that the board rule that this Court has implicitly affirmed over the years, the board rule that a good faith doubt entitles you to withdraw your recognition of the union, they took the position in that case and in the amicus in this case that that is no longer a good rule, and that the only way an employer can contest the majority status of an incumbent union is to file a decertification petition, and I--"
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.694,451.117,And they also said in their brief that general counsel had recommended such a position to the board.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,451.117,452.036,--Well--
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.036,453.308,"Where does that stand, do you know?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,453.308,456.419,"--My understanding, I've had an opportunity to look into that."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.506,486.079,So we may be talking about something that really doesn't matter anymore.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,492.992,496.705,"Well, I would just suggest if you look at the... if my--"
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.705,497.586,"--I mean, it matters to your client."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,499.948,506.292,--But I'm not sure what the likelihood is of the board adopting that particular view of the scenario I just described.
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.441,538.282,"But if you... we... you are going in this case on the proposition that there's a reasonable doubt rule, so that the question is, at what point can the employer... it's really a timing question."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,551.322,554.634,"There would be nothing out there for them to accept, is correct."
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.634,563.299,"So why can't the board say, we have to draw the line some place, we're going to draw it at the union's acceptance of the contract?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,563.299,582.493,"Well, of course, the board is apparently adopting this bright line theory that it's a lot easier to administer the act if we have a specific date, and obviously, I don't have a problem with that concept, but what I'm just saying is the specific date that they have picked, the bright line rule in this case, there is no logical basis for it."
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,602.165,606.467,"I take it that their basis is not a telegram, their basis is a contract, all right."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,606.467,606.947,Created--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.947,608.239,So once the contract is created--
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,608.239,608.94,--Created by--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,608.94,611.171,--you can't question it for the period of the contract bar.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,611.171,611.791,--Yes.
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.791,618.077,"And it doesn't... I mean, what is illogical about saying there's a contract bar, it starts when the contract was created?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,618.077,618.454,If--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,618.454,623.82,"If you have a complaint about the union, make it before the contract is... after, you're barred."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,625.2,625.701,--And that's--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.701,628.603,"And that, as I understand it, is the rule, and why is that illogical?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,628.603,629.872,--And that's their bright line theory.
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.492,657.841,"Is that right, even though it's been certified?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,662.454,685.009,"--Yes, Your Honor, at least beyond the... this is... the certification in this case, and of course, none of the employees who were involved in that certification process are still employed by the company, but the certification in that case was in the 1970's, as I recall, so you have... you could deal with... the board principle is that once it's certified there is an irrebuttable presumption no matter what happens to the majority status for a 1-year period."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.009,685.948,For 1 year.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,685.948,694.904,"So even though you know, as a matter of moral certainty, that the union has lost its majority status during that year, not only is it not illegal to deal with them, you have to deal with them."
1995.95-668,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.904,697.868,But that gets us back to Justice Breyer's question that I don't think you fully answered.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,709.544,732.09,"We suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the employer should have an opportunity, when it is going across a crescende of events that happened in this case during this 3-day period, should have an opportunity to analyze, review those events, to see whether in fact it is dealing with a majority or a minority union, and in this case we suggest that it didn't have."
1995.95-668,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,732.09,734.501,But you could have done that by withdrawing your offer.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,737.283,741.156,"In view of the board's decision in this case, Your Honor--"
1995.95-668,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.156,741.877,You wish you had done it.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,741.877,743.727,--I would... I certainly wish I had done it--
1995.95-668,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.727,744.588,"No, but I mean, you could--"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,744.588,754.524,"--and now the world knows that that's probably the best way to do it, but unfortunately that does not advance productive negotiations, where any time you have a question in your own mind--"
1995.95-668,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,754.524,764.4,"--Well, when the point comes that you're questioning the union's continuing capacity as a representative, there's going to be a certain chill upon the proceedings anyway."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,764.4,764.811,--Absolutely.
1995.95-668,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.811,775.668,"You've got to accept that, and I don't see that the chill is going to be any greater by withdrawing the offer on that ground than it is by doing what you want to do."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,775.668,782.353,"Well, I'll just take two of the major events, if I may, Your Honor, that led to the employees eventually creating in its own mind the good faith doubt."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.529,810.751,May I just interrupt with one question to be sure I understand correctly?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,830.683,834.476,"--That's correct, Your Honor, as long as we move quicker than they do."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.808,842.881,"Yes, but even if you didn't move quickly enough, if your doubts had been substantiated by your thorough investigation on Monday and Tuesday, you still would have been protected."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,842.881,848.625,--If... we would have been protected only if we had withdrawn the offer or withdrawn recognition.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.625,850.468,Or if you could prove they did not have a majority.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,850.468,880.027,"Our position is, we would be... if at the time of that telegram, and we had the opportunity to conduct this investigation, even though we had not won that race to the telegraph office, we would be protected, and that's our position in this case, Justice Stevens, that the mere fact that they send a telegram before we have an opportunity to fire off our withdrawal... and I'd ask the Court to bear in mind that this was Thanksgiving week, it was a 3-day week, and Sunday of week... we couldn't fire it back, obviously, that evening."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.888,882.248,I'm not sure--
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,897.809,901.599,"--We know the board is not taking a position on that, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.462,904.223,"Right, so--"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,904.223,906.194,"--on that issue, even though the court of appeals said--"
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.194,909.566,"--I think your answer to Justice Stevens' question has to be, we really don't know, the board's going to tell us some day."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,916.45,918.753,"--They did not, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.753,919.371,They did not.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,919.371,921.024,There was no evidence submitted--
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.024,921.835,There was no finding one way or the other.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,921.835,922.794,--That is correct.
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.117,927.598,Or by you.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,927.598,932.1,--to attempt to support that there was no... that there was a majority status.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.041,940.415,"You had a good faith doubt, I understand that, but did you also try to prove that there was on fact no majority."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,940.415,942.048,"--Yes, and we explained that."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.048,943.717,And was there a finding on that point?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,943.717,944.328,No.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.328,944.809,I see.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,944.809,945.41,"No, there was no finding."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.245,984.283,"Well, the way you describe it, it sounds as though at least the administrative law judge's ruling was that even though you had been able to prove that there was no majority support, it was irrelevant, and yet I understood you to say the board took no position if you could prove that fact."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,984.283,1005.748,"--The board in its petition, in its brief to this Court has expressly reserved and said that that might be a different consideration but we're not going to get into that, because we feel a good faith doubt case, which they claim this is, is different from a actual loss of majority case, so they are hypothesizing saying it might be different, but they are not expressly taking that position."
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1005.748,1026.801,"Well, what's the effect of that case from this Court in '61, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union case, where presumably we held it was an unfair labor practice for an employer to enter a collective bargaining agreement with a union that in fact lacks majority support?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1030.224,1032.996,"I think it's excellent law, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-668,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1032.996,1037.739,So do you think it's open to the board to alter that rule or not?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1037.739,1044.954,"We would suggest it is not, and I would remind the Court, as I am sure we do not have to, that in that case there was an unknowing violation."
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.493,1060.274,Mr.--
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1062.125,1080.367,"That's correct, and the ironic aspect of this case is, I find it difficult to reconcile the logic of the ILG which says it's an unfair labor practice even unknowingly to enter into a contract with a minority union, but the--"
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.367,1098.569,"Mr. O'Reilly, is there something different in a union that has never been certified by the board, which I take it was the ILGWU case, where there's a concern that maybe it's a sweetheart union, and here, where the board was... the union was certified and had a long-term bargaining relationship with the company?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1098.569,1111.928,"--There is a possible, or a definite argument, certainly during the 1 year after the certification, that there was a legitimate recognition, but the certification in this case goes back at least a generation, so I think the mere fact that they were certified--"
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1111.928,1115.741,But the employer at any point could have asked for a new election.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1115.741,1117.671,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1117.671,1119.664,Instead of renewing the contract.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1119.664,1120.663,That's... that's--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.663,1124.456,"Well then, why... is... are you saying the contract bar rule is unlawful?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1124.456,1125.538,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.077,1128.34,"Well, the contract bar rule has to start somewhere."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1128.34,1129.158,It's... has--
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.158,1132.52,"So... and I take it it's up to the board, basically, to say where it starts."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1132.52,1140.475,--But a contract bar rule would never be based upon an agreement that in turn is an unfair labor practice.
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.07,1172.297,"But even if they've lost their majority status during the time of the contract, and different people, people come in and say, look, we represent the workers now, junk that, you can't do anything about it."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1172.297,1172.988,That's correct.
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.988,1179.19,"So that principle has to start some place, so I want to see what's wrong, what's illogical about starting it?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1179.19,1189.789,I think you have to focus on when was the collective bargaining agreement that serves as the basis for the... what was the basis of the offer and acceptance?
1995.95-668,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1233.507,1247.506,"Have employers ever appended to their offer clause that says, if you accept this offer, execution of the contract will be subject to our determining within 7 days that you continue to have a majority status?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1247.506,1259.504,"I have not encountered that type of situation, but this decision, if it is upheld, might encourage the type of appendage to an offer."
1995.95-668,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1260.475,1265.848,There would be no bar in labor law from appending such a clause to an offer.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1265.848,1268.81,--I think the labor board might have a problem with that.
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.889,1288.132,"With respect to the board, they did this twice because the First Circuit said the first time it wasn't good enough."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1296.389,1304.082,I think the deference that this Court traditionally gives to labor board decisions is not applicable here.
1995.95-668,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.492,1322.025,"And there, you're taking on the First Circuit, too, which decided it was rational."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1322.025,1331.061,"--The... well, not in the presence of some people in this Court that we are going to call the First Circuit irrational, but they--"
1995.95-668,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.061,1331.963,From time to time.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1334.413,1353.966,"--They did determine, without saying why, really... of course, they sent it back, you will recall, in the first instance saying that the board's decision really didn't say anything, that cited a few cases having nothing to do with this factual situation, and then after the board finally... and the Court did create a rather impossible task for the board."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.578,1376.859,Did the board give you an opportunity to prove that in fact there was no majority status?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1376.859,1380.433,"Yes, Your Honor, we had a 3-day hearing before the administrative law judge."
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.433,1383.555,And did they make a finding that you couldn't... that you hadn't proved it?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1383.555,1383.905,No.
1995.95-668,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.0,1419.619,I find it difficult to understand how it can possibly be said that the question of whether actual nonmajority status would suffice to avoid the contract bar rule is not in this case.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1421.529,1430.034,"Well, my position, of course, it is in this case, notwithstanding perhaps inartful phrasing of mine in the petition for certiorari."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.034,1440.493,"Apart from the question presented, may I ask you where in the papers before us is there either a pleading or an argument by you or your client that there was, in fact, no majority status?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1445.276,1446.537,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.537,1447.138,And where?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1447.138,1450.969,In the two decisions of the court of appeals.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.796,1463.509,"3a, you say?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1463.509,1464.23,3a of the--
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.23,1466.46,The white brief?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1466.46,1468.26,"--No, of the... I'm sorry, yes, of the petition."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.26,1469.022,"Petition, okay."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1469.022,1476.796,And the court of appeals said the board thus refused to allow the company to present evidence--
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.796,1479.129,"Where on page 3a are you reading from, Mr. O'Reilly?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1487.695,1488.855,--Yes.
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.855,1489.947,--The middle of the page.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1490.467,1498.501,"Thank you, Mr. Chief... the board thus refused to allow the company to present evidence that the union in fact lacked majority support at the time it accepted the company's outstanding offer."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.734,1516.653,"Yes, but the preceding sentence says that the board affirmed the ALJ's refusal to consider the company's defense that at the time the union accepted the company's contract proposal, the company entertained a good faith doubt."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1516.653,1517.464,--Yes.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.464,1521.466,So it describes your defense as one that they... that you entertained a good faith doubt.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1521.466,1522.247,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.247,1524.247,And you're saying there was an additional defense.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1524.247,1526.849,It was... we used the same evidence to--
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.849,1527.25,I know.
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1536.806,1540.369,--I would have to ask leave of the Court to stray from the record.
1995.95-668,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.321,1559.901,"Forgetting the briefs for a minute, how about your pleading?"
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1559.901,1565.256,"--No, in the pleading, Your Honor, our response said only we had a good faith doubt."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.773,1578.453,"So you say you raised it to the board, then."
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1578.453,1581.796,"In our briefs, Your Honor, but not in our answer, expressly."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.796,1586.748,And did the board refuse to consider it because you hadn't raised it in your answer?
1995.95-668,0,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,1586.748,1599.417,"The board's position was that the evidence, whether it purported to go to a good faith doubt or to a lack of majority status was immaterial in view of the contract having been formed."
1995.95-668,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.589,1602.861,"Very well, Mr. O'Reilly."
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1605.222,1610.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1995.95-668,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.805,1635.642,"Well, what would the situation be, Mr. Seamon, if, in fact, there were no majority support at the time the union tried to accept the offer?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1635.642,1640.775,"Justice O'Connor, the board has not addressed that issue, and it reserves it in this case."
1995.95-668,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.302,1661.818,"Well, is it possible that if in fact there was no majority support that it would be an unfair labor practice for the employer to enter the contract?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1661.818,1678.381,"It is possible but I would emphasize that one important difference to which Justice Ginsburg alluded between the present context and Garment Workers is that Garment Workers involved a voluntarily recognized union, whereas the present case involves a union that was certified by the board."
1995.95-668,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.381,1681.971,"Was there anything in the opinion that made it turn on that, do you know?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1681.971,1693.86,"The board framed its rule in terms of a previously certified union, and its prior decision in the same context called Belcon also dealt with a previously certified union."
1995.95-668,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.86,1703.125,And is it your position that the pleadings in this case did not raise the in fact lack of support issue?
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1703.125,1704.327,Emphatically so.
1995.95-668,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.557,1724.12,"But in its briefs below, it tried to present that issue?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1724.12,1727.272,"--No, that is also inaccurate, in our view."
1995.95-668,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.089,1754.27,"Where on the page are you reading from, Mr. Seamon?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1754.27,1758.133,"--I'm reading from the beginning of footnote 85, on page 85a."
1995.95-668,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.133,1758.972,Okay.
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1758.972,1772.573,"We agree with the judge that, under established board precedent, once the board finds that the parties have reached a binding collective bargaining agreement, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of a respondent's alleged good faith doubt of the union's majority status."
1995.95-668,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.166,1797.529,"And this is the board's opinion, 65a."
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1797.529,1798.98,This is the board's supplemental decision in this case.
1995.95-668,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.98,1832.532,"Well, I suppose the only way we really know that the... correct me if I'm wrong, that we know in a legal sense that the board... that the union doesn't have majority status is that there's been a certification, or decertification petition and an election, and it seems to me the employer is being put in a very difficult position here where it makes the quite careful, measured statement that it has good faith doubt, which is a term of art in the labor law, and then you fault him for not saying that he knew."
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1837.655,1850.985,"Well, one of the reasons that the board has developed the good faith doubt rule is the recognition that it can be difficult, in the absence of a decertification, to prove an actual loss of majority status."
1995.95-668,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.985,1859.219,And it seems to me that the employer acted quite consistently with the dictates of the labor board and the dictates of the labor law in that regard.
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1859.219,1874.02,"The labor law permitted it to assert a good faith doubt, but it also required it to take other steps to either withdraw its offer and then assert the good faith doubt to petition for an election before the new agreement was entered into by the union's acceptance of its offer."
1995.95-668,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1891.2,1903.909,"But isn't the force of your argument somewhat undercut by the fact that the board is reserving the question of what the result should be if, in fact, the claim was and was proven that there had been a loss of majority support?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1941.372,1942.214,I--
1995.95-668,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1942.214,1948.747,--and there goes the whole need for the bright line... or the whole justification based on a bright line argument.
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1948.747,1979.637,"--I acknowledge, Justice Souter, that one of the difficulties that would arise from creating a different rule for claims of actual loss of majority status from the rule that applies to good faith doubt claims is that employers would be tempted to circumvent it by a mere point of pleading, to say not only did I have a good faith doubt, but I also believe that the union in fact lost majority status, and that may, in fact, be a consideration that the board could validly take into account if and when in the future it addresses the question of whether the rule should be different."
1995.95-668,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1979.637,1980.328,But it is--
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1993.636,2000.091,It is a very serious question for the reasons elaborated in the Ladies' Garment Workers decision.
1995.95-668,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2004.944,2011.708,"So you're saying that the need for the bright line is still there, but there just may be a circumstance in which, need or no need, we simply cannot have the benefit of it?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2011.708,2026.628,"--That is right, and again, quite apart from the employer's temptation to plead an actual loss of majority status, it is perfectly logical for the board's rule to operate upon the acceptance of the petitioner's outstanding contract offer."
1995.95-668,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.719,2029.93,"No, but... may I interrupt you, though?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2044.27,2045.211,"--Yes, that's correct."
1995.95-668,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2045.211,2045.642,"Yes, okay."
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2045.642,2046.08,That's correct.
1995.95-668,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.08,2052.143,But that reservation also would be overtaken if the general counsel's Lee Lumber proposal is adopted.
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2052.143,2053.887,"Yes, that's also correct."
1995.95-668,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.887,2059.069,And do you... can you give us any representation of where that proceeding stands?
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2059.069,2059.73,Yes.
1995.95-668,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.146,2088.068,What is the gestation period for a proceeding like this?
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2088.068,2090.011,I'm uncertain of the answer to that.
1995.95-668,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.011,2093.922,Maybe they should think about rulemaking down there at the NL--
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2095.373,2097.374,"Of course, they do from time to time."
1995.95-668,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.516,2101.258,"Think about it from time to time, are you saying?"
1995.95-668,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2101.739,2109.663,--I recognize the AFL-CIO takes the position that the pendency of Lee Lumber renders the grant of cert improvident.
1995.95-668,2,32267,john_d_oreilly_iii,,2545.537,2547.329,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-668,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.591,2656.723,"Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly."
