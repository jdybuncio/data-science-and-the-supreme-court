1976.76-413,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,14.145,15.031,It is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.76-413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,15.031,16.829,You may proceed whenever you are ready.
1976.76-413,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,16.829,19.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-413,1,41593,stephen_daniel_keeffe,,1570.091,1574.013,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3495.758,3499.592,"Yes, thank you Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.697,3553.346,"I just want to make clear, if we disagreed with you and held or thought that the government really did promise these VRBs contrary to your position, you are not relying on any power or you would lose them, I think, you are not relying on any power of Congress to reduce whatever they promised?"
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3553.346,3555.432,"No we have no done so, Mr. Justice White."
1976.76-413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.57,3595.348,"In fact, I would thought that in essence is what the Court of Appeals seem to have said."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3595.348,3599.387,"What the Court of Appeals said, it sensed there is a money judgment, they don't need any thing else."
1976.76-413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3605.724,3607.839,"They were never, there is no basic for rescission."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3607.839,3609.854,That was correct.
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3609.854,3612.881,"Mr. Jones, I have two questions, if I might ask you."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3625.217,3628.74,On my answer to that Mr. Justice Stevens is yes or no.
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3663.917,3671.785,Why do you understand the Court of Appeals to disagree with the Secretary's interpretation of his regulations?
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3671.785,3673.423,Well I think it was a very...
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3673.423,3677.521,Was it based at all on the Legislative History?
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3677.521,3692.852,"That is not -- I think the Court, the Court's allusions to the Legislative History were based upon statements that were made with respect to reenlistments and not with respect to extensions of enlistment."
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3714.38,3717.319,"Mr. Jones, I had a second question I want to ask you."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3746.029,3749.081,"Again Mr. Justice Stevens, yes and no."
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3809.778,3815.842,"I understand, but you would not rely on the analogy of the military cutting the pay."
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3815.842,3830.773,"Well Mr. Justice Stevens, we would argued that just as the Congress can reduce the pay, the Congress or the Navy with under delegated responsibility can reduce the award level."
1976.76-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3830.773,3832.808,Yes if that's appearing in the regulation.
1976.76-413,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3832.808,3834.565,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1976.76-413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3835.519,3836.335,Thank you gentleman.
