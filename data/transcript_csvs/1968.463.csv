1968.463,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.423,"Number 463, National Labor Relations Board, petitioner, versus Wyman-Gordon Co."
1968.463,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,18.794,24.755,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.463,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.874,210.068,"Right there, Mr. Solicitor General, did the -- was it the Board which selected this groups who should receive invitations to --"
1968.463,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,210.068,213.544,"As I understand it, Mr. Justice, it was."
1968.463,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.544,218.18,"In other words, this-- unlike the rule making procedure, this was not left open for anybody in this system."
1968.463,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,218.18,223.613,The opinion says that the Board invited certain interested parties to file briefs.
1968.463,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.027,241.637,"It was -- these were -- I see, these were invitations to a somewhat exclusive group, or at least --"
1968.463,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,241.637,244.226,"Yes, but a rather representative group."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2011.598,2015.666,I would please the Court.
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2178.373,2179.659,Would you --
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2179.659,2179.898,Pardon?
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2179.898,2184.086,An order was issued against you in this specific case.
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2184.086,2184.774,I didn't -- I'm sorry?
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.774,2196.289,"I say, an order was issued against you in this specific case, an order commanding you to comply with the Excelsior procedures."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2196.289,2200.388,"Well, that order, if you call it that, sir, came out --"
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2200.388,2202.305,"Well, wasn't it an order?"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2202.305,2213.432,"Well, it was in effect, but it w -- when the Board sends notice that a petition for an election has been filed, it also sends a notification in regard the Excelsior list."
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2220.109,2223.243,"Well, then you -- I suppose you would --"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2223.243,2223.911,We had no other means --
1968.463,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2223.911,2228.248,I suppose you would agree that you really have to contest two things here.
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2249.58,2254.811,I would say we would have to do it that -- exactly that.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.692,2313.35,"Well, Mr. Young, do you -- is it your suggestion that this is the only way the Board could've proceeded?"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2313.35,2324.417,"No, it is not my position, but it's my position that this is a rule of the nature that should've been published in a proc -- following the procedure -- the Administrative Procedure Act."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.417,2327.509,"You say, no, it isn't the only way it could've proceeded there?"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2327.509,2334.867,I recognize the fact that the agency has a right to make rules in an adjudicatory fashion and in a quasi-legislative fashion.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.867,2337.107,Couldn't it made this one in adjudicative --
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2337.107,2338.573,"Well, I -- it's our contention --"
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.573,2341.242,Context without purporting to an argument?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2341.242,2351.082,It's our contention that it is improper adjudicatory deci -- rule making here because they decided case one way between Excelsior and the Board.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.356,2361.06,"Yes, but the date -- I suppose that they've decided -- they certainly have decided you against you."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2361.06,2363.548,"Well, they hadn't made no decision as such."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.191,2367.099,Why not?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2367.099,2374.039,Because they haven't -- I refuse to give them the list where the sole purpose is to turn around and hand it to the units.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.039,2375.369,And then what did the Board do?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2375.369,2378.611,Then the Board filed a subpoena.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.611,2379.03,Issued a subpoena.
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2379.03,2380.705,Issued a subpoena.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.705,2381.243,And the --
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2381.243,2382.859,The District Court upheld the subpoena and the Circuit --
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.859,2397.365,"The Board, in this case, this concrete case now before us has said that, “in connection with this election, you must furnish the list,” and you said “no, we don't” and that's when they got a subpoena."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2400.044,2401.353,That's correct.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.353,2406.946,"Now, assume that subpoena is valid."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2411.715,2412.044,No.
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.044,2413.366,If you concede --
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2413.366,2417.658,"If the subpoena is valid, I have to give up the list, but I --"
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.658,2425.558,You might end up -- you say the subpoena -- part for the reason for your saying the subpoena is invalid is because of the Excelsior rule?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2425.558,2438.808,"We claim that the Excelsior rule is invalid, that the list is not subject to subpoena powers of the District Court because it is not evidence and it is not to be used to resolve any investigation."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.808,2446.96,That would be the same question whether Excelsior had been adopted or --
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2446.96,2451.417,"It would be the same whether Excelsior existed or not, but it is my further contention --"
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.417,2454.459,But how is the rule itself involved here?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2454.459,2455.006,Pardon?
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.006,2458.594,How is the rule itself involved here?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2458.594,2462.393,"Well, the subpoena was issued on the basis of the rule."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.393,2468.294,"Well, it was also issued just on the basis of the Board's decision in this case if they want the list."
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2468.294,2469.07,"No, sir."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.624,2500.078,"I suppose even if their rule that they adopted was not valid that they might, in this case, have said “well, we think, in the context of this case, the employer should furnish the list of employees.”"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2500.078,2502.834,"They could've done that, but they did not."
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.834,2504.976,"So, you could -- you agree they could've done that?"
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2504.976,2507.339,I agree that they possibly could've done it and we would've had a trial --
1968.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.339,2509.317,In the context of this specific case?
1968.463,1,38491,quentin_o_young,,2509.317,2516.037,We would have had to follow the same procedure in order to contest it.
1968.463,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3917.507,3920.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I make a correction in one of my --"
1968.463,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3920.546,3920.786,Yes.
1968.463,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3920.786,3921.997,Interest to a question.
1968.463,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3921.997,3923.681,"You may, Mr. Solicitor General."
1968.463,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3923.681,3938.373,"I was asked whether there were other instances where the Labor Board or other agencies had made prospective determinations in adjudicatory proceedings, and I said I was unaware of them."
1968.463,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3955.138,3956.96,Very well.
