1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.467,"Number 82, United States against Topco Associates."
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,7.867,11.482,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-82,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,117.592,121.552,"This was after a full trial before Judge Hubert Will, was it?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,121.552,125.092,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,216.122,224.399,Are the members of Topco in any way inhibited from acquiring other brands in the open market?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,224.399,225.526,"No, Your Honor, they are not."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,225.526,228.589,Their membership does not restrict their activities?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,228.589,233.763,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.155,275.044,What percentage of that gross is represented by Topco brand names?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,275.044,292.971,"Out of the $2.3 billion in total sales, about 10% is Topco supplied products, 237 million and about 133 million of that would be Topco brand products, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.652,320.975,Does Topco supply any goods under the private label?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,320.975,321.805,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.805,326.396,"So, it does no purchasing of nationally labeled -- of national label?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,326.396,333.119,"I think not of national label products, they may buy a few, but there are great many non-branded goods."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.174,363.704,"And, what is it, that a Topco affiliate is given an exclusive license, whatever it is, they sell the Topco brand in its areas, is that it?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,363.704,365.233,That is correct.
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.233,367.005,That is the crux of the government's case?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,367.005,368.454,That is the crux of the government's case.
1971.70-82,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.053,395.078,"And, what is the remedy of the government was?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,395.078,400.515,The remedy which is it to enjoin the territorialization and the wholesale restriction.
1971.70-82,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,400.515,403.26,Which would be limited then?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,409.377,417.164,"Yes, Your Honor, the injunction would run against the restrictive term in Topco’s bylaws which require this territorialization."
1971.70-82,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,417.164,420.088,"Now, is that –- can you refer me to that term?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,420.088,422.41,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,472.675,488.661,"What if the particular chain member, who has a small chain, wants to expand his territory, does he have any problem until he runs into the territory of another?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,488.661,499.229,"In order to expand his territory, he had to get the consent of the Topco organization, which of course consists of its fellow chains."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.062,513.47,"But if it is open territory, I assume Topco wants to sell all of the merchandise, it can and so if it is open, they can move into it?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,513.47,514.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.205,519.381,And it is open in the sense of not being franchised to another member?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,519.381,524.483,"Yes, if the Topco organization is not licensed to territory it will be open."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.635,548.852,Is the operation nationwide?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,548.852,550.153,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.232,857.866,"But, how does this work out?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,870.805,875.712,"Well, it would depend on the type of license, which was given."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,895.93,899.105,Are we concerned then only with the exclusive license?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,899.105,899.724,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.908,947.673,You mean in the hypothetical I gave you they would not have --?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,947.673,952.715,I doubt very much that 7-Eleven and Giant would both -- have been licensed at the same time.
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.715,960.946,"Does the government agree with the District Court that after the exclusivity, the Topco would dissolve?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,960.946,964.798,"No, we do not, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.05,985.521,"Wholly inside the private brand operations, joint buying is still an attractive mechanism?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,985.521,987.878,"Not only it is attractive, Your Honor, it is necessary."
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.925,1023.496,"Well, I gather Topco in any of event does not promote -- does not advertise?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1023.496,1023.671,No --
1971.70-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.671,1026.357,It is the local chains that do all the promotions of the brand?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1026.357,1027.67,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.368,1133.776,Tell me.
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1144.093,1144.512,"No, we did not."
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1144.512,1153.752,"Well now if the Court made a finding that it would and suppose we accept that, suppose we had to accept that fact, what then is the government’s position?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1153.752,1164.482,"Well, Your Honor, our position would remain that if Topco has -- in order to compete and engage in horizontal territorialization, you have to give up Topco --"
1971.70-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1164.482,1167.496,Even though it would have just (Inaudible) -- just --?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1167.496,1168.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.941,1273.49,"Well, do I get a suggestion out of your argument that there should be a per se rule because it is inconvenient and difficult for the government to prove a case-by-case violation?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1273.49,1274.42,"Oh! No, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.746,1290.496,"Well, of course the per se rule is always very predictable, but that is hardly a reason standing alone for having per se rule?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1290.496,1293.511,"It is one of the factors and the other major factor, of course, Your Honor --"
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1293.511,1294.78,Standing alone I say?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1294.78,1297.736,"Oh! Standing alone, it would not be, of course."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.224,1330.46,"What did the Court have to say, the District Court have to say about the impact on the public interest, consumer interest if Topco had to dissolve, go out of operation?"
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1330.46,1336.365,The District Court felt that the public would be disadvantaged if Topco were to dissolve.
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.365,1343.546,I will agree with that in and off itself it is not part of it or do you think that is not relevant?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1343.546,1357.305,"Well, I think that the Topco organization does achieve very useful and beneficial economies of scale and advantages in distribution for its members."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1357.305,1363.892,What about keeping the big chains under competitive conditions?
1971.70-82,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1363.892,1370.496,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there are means of combining group buying power without territorialization."
1971.70-82,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1392.403,1395.206,"Fine, Mr. Shapiro."
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1400.918,1406.612,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1758.999,1762.937,"Now, would you develop that course a little bit?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1770.393,1778.4,"The national chains, as I have outlined, had developed these private brands and they had built them as competitive tools."
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.883,1785.874,Could you put that in terms of an illustration?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1798.854,1814.081,"A&P would develop their own line of private labels, which the consumer recognized were available only in A&P stores, Ann Page was one of their principle products, for example.M"
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.081,1823.421,"And, A&P I take it controls the competitive situation as between stores by their power to locate their supermarkets, wherever they want to?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1823.421,1835.037,"That is correct, but the consumer knows that if she wants to buy Ann Page Green Beans, for example, she is required to go to an A&P Store in order to obtain them."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1868.997,1902.195,"But why would it be impossible for an illustration I gave to Shapiro, having all of the Topco, with all the economies of scale, having both Giant and 7-Eleven, with Giant, having Green Beans under some private Giant label of green beans and 7-Eleven having some 7-Eleven green beans although they are both packed by the same patron, but the economies of scale realized in the purchasing and the packing arrangement, that Topco affects for it."
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1905.148,1921.214,"It does not work in the Topco context because even though they have combined into a purchasing organization with large volumes, they still have not achieved sufficient volume by which they could have a different private label for each member."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1946.355,1948.692,Was this explored exactly in the District Court at all?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1948.692,1949.324,Pardon me Mr. Justice?
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.324,1951.729,Was this possibility explored in the District Court?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1951.729,1953.803,There was discussion on this.
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.595,1977.775,102?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,1977.775,2003.821,"Government Exhibit 102 at page 438, in which one, the second line of labels, it was determined to, page 440 is the relevant reference, and there it is indicated that just one additional line of labels would cost $350,000.00, well beyond the capacity of it."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.844,2097.264,"But of course each 7-Eleven and Giant had its own label, assuming that $350,000.00 was not that much of value, that would mean of course that neither would have an exclusive on that particular item, even though it is under a different brand name?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2097.264,2101.376,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2101.376,2108.209,Why is that precisely what the anti trust laws preclude?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2108.209,2116.341,"The purpose is not to prevent another member from having the identical item, in terms of the content of the can or jar or container."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.032,2128.727,The illustration I h=gave you would permit that.
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2136.524,2137.542,That is correct and this is (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2137.542,2147.234,"And under this arrangement that does not happen, because only Giant or only 7-Eleven is allowed the Topco private label, is that not right?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2147.234,2155.097,"Except that through the cooperative, it would not be possible for them to obtain second lines of labels, so that each could have his own label."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.272,2184.765,"Well, let us assume for the moment that if it was just cheap for each person to have his own private label as to have, let us just say, one brand among all of them, then the effective exclusivity in this arrangement is simply to limit competition in private label goods."
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2188.61,2190.504,"No, it would not do that."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.585,2222.538,"As compared with the situation where each chain has its own private label and is free to move into any market at once, with its own private label, as compared with that, the present system under Topco does limit the quantity of competition and private label merchandise?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2222.538,2228.032,If we are taking only the Topco Cooperative as a source of private brand that would be true.
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.618,2242.739,"Is it not true that the locals do their own promoting of the brand, of the Topco brand anyway?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2242.739,2244.61,They do indeed and they must because --
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.61,2246.377,And the Topco does not do that?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2246.377,2248.816,Topco does not do that.
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.816,2255.683,"So, it would not be anymore expensive for a local chain to promote its own private label and the Topco label, except for start-up cost, maybe?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2255.683,2257.123,"Well, it is more than start-up cost."
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.095,2317.524,"Which chain was it you say graduated from Topco, you mentioned one of them?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2317.524,2320.612,"Well, Giant was one I believe that Mr. Shapiro mentioned."
1971.70-82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.483,2362.71,Does this suggest that the private label program is so important to the whole arrangement that without it Topco would disappear?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2362.71,2368.213,"That is correct and that is precisely what Judge Will found, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.213,2385.326,"And why would it disappear if there was still great advantage against the act of cooperative purchasing, even of nationally branded goods?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2385.326,2419.17,"I think that it would be a process and I think that if I can describe that process quite briefly, if exclusivity of a private brand would be lost, the members closest to graduation, closest to the ability to develop their own private label program would no longer be interested in continuing to pour their corporate resources into private label, which would be subject to use by others, and therefore, they would look for their own private label to begin, to develop their own private label program."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.673,2424.559,"And, there are no addition advantages out of Topco such as --"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2424.559,2426.788,"Well, there may be but if they would no longer --"
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.788,2429.219,There would be or not?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2429.219,2429.687,Yes.
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.687,2434.714,"And, if there were actual advantages, it would wholly effect the private label --"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2434.714,2438.901,"That is right, there are advantages, but they are advantages of the private label program."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.682,2470.937,Are you trying to emphasize the transient nature of the membership of Topco which does appear in the record and the brief?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2485.71,2486.308,That is correct.
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.308,2500.362,"And therefore, lost all of the consumer goodwill and habits of buying of the previous labels and had it to develop its own or did do it in a transitory -- transitional way?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2500.362,2519.426,"Well, it takes a transitional period, in order for this to occur, but normally when a chain would develop its own private label or frequently when they will, they will develop and other their own corporate name, so that it will be immediately identified in the mind of the consumer as its brand of that store."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2519.426,2524.554,"Often it is not the cooperate name, but it is some sort of acronym or something?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2524.554,2525.326,"That is correct, it may --"
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.326,2527.805,Or add page for A&P and so on?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2527.805,2530.41,Or contraction of the store name.
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2530.41,2538.778,"How does the person be -- how does a company become a member of the Topco and how does it get out, any?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2538.778,2558.837,"The membership -- there is a membership committee in Topco, a group of independent employees of the organization, who are seeking new members all the time and actively soliciting new members, for new membership will give the cooperative the volume which they need to achieve economy."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.575,2601.248,"And the stock they owned, does Topco repurchase by something or what?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2601.248,2605.136,The common stock is repurchased at par.
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2664.727,2671.949,"Talking about that period, does the government conceive that it did not adversely affect prices or is that --?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2671.949,2674.453,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.408,2829.554,"Well, Mr. --did not Judge Will find that this arrangement did restrain competition in private label merchandise?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2829.554,2839.206,"Judge Will found that it had no appreciable influence on the two aspects of competition, which the government claims were injured."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.242,2857.97,What did he find about the effect on competition generally in the private label merchandising?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2873.213,2876.757,That reference I believe was a reference to the government’s argument.
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.757,2878.029,Did he not find that?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2878.029,2879.603,"No, not quite."
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.431,2905.609,"What if he was wrong in saying that you made balance competitive impact like this, but competitors may combine as long as it furthers competition with another group of competitors?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2908.34,2909.876,I think.
1971.70-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.786,2919.61,"Well, let us assume that he did that he was wrong, is that -- do you say that is proper -- that is the proper act of law?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2919.61,2925.253,I do not think that is the proper way to approach the problem and I do not think that Judge Will approached it that way.
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.034,2964.528,"You mean his approach was that assuming the government was correct on some possible adverse competitive impact, it was offset --"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2964.528,2965.066,"Yes, I think what he --"
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2965.066,2966.206,-- benefits to the public?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2966.206,2977.212,"What he was saying is that the ultimate effect, that is correct Mr. Chief Justice, was a benefit to the public."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.145,3222.887,"Mr. Grimm, one thing I -- it is not entirely clear to me on the factual situation is this."
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3241.317,3242.764,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.229,3275.787,Your Topco retail member carries?
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3275.787,3281.929,"That is right and that retailer serves several hundreds, so called Mom & Pop groceries."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.929,3282.87,"That wholesaler, you mean?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3282.87,3287.011,"That wholesaler, I am sorry, who in effect use those as their private labels."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.011,3288.119,I see.
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3289.718,3291.38,The other is a similar organization.
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.857,3313.72,"The wholesalers therefore deal in a secondary label, in a different label from the label carried by the retail member in the same area?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3313.72,3318.2,"In those areas, where there is a retail member existing, that is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3318.2,3329.509,"But they might deal in the primary label in an area where there is not a retail member and in that area, the wholesalers will just sell to the independent Mom & Pop corner grocery stores?"
1971.70-82,1,43590,victor_e_grimm,,3329.509,3330.285,That is correct.
1971.70-82,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.285,3334.08,Alright.
1971.70-82,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.08,3338.127,"Mr. Shapiro, you have about seven minutes left."
1971.70-82,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3338.127,3343.01,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-82,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.492,3621.455,"Mr. Shapiro, you said earlier that two Topco stores tend to compete better with Giant than one."
1971.70-82,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3635.104,3648.194,"Well, let us suppose that we had in the same market -- let me give the example that I referred to a moment ago, the situation in Michigan."
