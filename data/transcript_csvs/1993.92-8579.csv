1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.567,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-8579, Charles Elder v. R. D. Holloway."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,10.108,21.214,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.112,95.213,Why do you say that's a special rule?
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,104.488,105.269,That is true.
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.269,118.229,"And might not prior law also be... certainly current law is not... is not a question of fact, but what was the state of prior law at a particular point in time, why can't that be a... why isn't that a question of fact?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,118.229,126.473,"Well, it's a question of law because in all of this... this Court's cases dealing with the qualified immunity issue, this Court has stated that it's a pure question of law."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.941,139.844,But it is a question of law for that purpose.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,176.371,186.799,"--No, I believe that's a question of law, because it's a question which does not go to trying to ascertain evidence in the sense of evidence that may be impeached or contradicted or contradictory."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.165,199.909,"So foreign law is a question of... is a question of law, then."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,199.909,203.219,Foreign law is a question that is--
1993.92-8579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.219,204.141,It's a question of law--
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,217.3,218.72,--That's true--
1993.92-8579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.72,225.074,--So to that extent you can call them... but they're not questions of fact in that they're submitted to a jury to decide.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,225.074,226.155,--That's correct.
1993.92-8579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.155,229.428,"And under Rule 44 they are questions of law, aren't they?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,229.428,240.667,"Foreign law is a question of law, but this Court's decisions have also repeatedly emphasized that certainly questions of Federal law are questions of law, ascertaining what the legal authorities are."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.516,286.005,"But... excuse me, but this isn't... we're not looking for what the correct rule of law is."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,302.129,311.772,--Because the process for determining what the law was is essentially the same process as a court now going to decide what the question is.
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.772,315.285,"We're looking for what the law was thought to be, not for what the law was."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,315.285,317.618,And the process is the same.
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.972,376.646,"Well, let's... let's assume that one of the basic elements of the law at that time consisted of a document, let's say records of the convention or something, that showed that a particular right was a constitutional right, but that document was... had not yet been discovered at the time this lawsuit was in action."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,390.227,395.54,That would... I'm not sure that that would necessarily go to a question of fact.
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.77,405.487,"When... when the decision was pronounced, whether a Supreme Court decision came down before... before this litigation or after this, isn't that a question of fact?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,405.487,411.462,--The date that an authority becomes known is a factual matter in the sense that it happens on a particular date.
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.368,482.851,What... but it's not incorrect as a matter of law.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,497.233,504.886,"It will be an incorrect statement of what the law is, and resolution of what this Court has said is a purely legal issue."
1993.92-8579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.886,519.967,"Well, you're... you're saying, I think, that there may be more... there may be several questions involved as subsidiary questions in determining whether ultimately a given proposition of law was clearly understood at the time in question."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,544.703,545.284,"Yes, it is."
1993.92-8579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.284,545.545,Okay.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,550.38,550.651,No.
1993.92-8579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.853,558.859,There's no claim that the... that the... that the... that the law reports had been hidden or locked away from people.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,558.859,559.24,--No.
1993.92-8579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.24,559.54,Okay.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,559.54,570.709,"There is no claim that it was inaccessible, and what the Ninth Circuit did here is say that you only look to the district court record, defining the record as being the legal authorities that were also cited."
1993.92-8579,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,570.709,576.345,And I take it the test is an objective test as to what a reasonable officer should know.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,576.345,588.861,"It is the same objective test announced in all this Court's qualified immunity cases, in terms of what was the announced law at that time in the reporters or other authorities that are accessible and establish law."
1993.92-8579,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,598.497,608.866,"Well, if... if the decision came down a day after the officer acted, I take it he could still defend that at the time he acted the decision had not been--"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,608.866,615.578,Authorities that come down after the conduct would not be ones that could be looked to for answering this question.
1993.92-8579,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.013,626.016,"--Do the cases talk much about what ""clearly established"" means?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,631.732,636.003,They do not talk about inter-circuit conflicts.
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.306,674.371,"The Ninth Circuit itself just relied on one, didn't it, that Al-Azzawy opinion?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,674.371,674.631,--Yes.
1993.92-8579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.473,692.473,"Well, it was not considered because counsel didn't bring it to the court's attention, I assume."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,692.473,693.154,That's correct.
1993.92-8579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.154,702.871,And one can understand a certain degree of frustration when you have counsel that doesn't call attention to the court an obvious controlling precedent.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,702.871,704.36,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.819,809.014,"Well, Mr. Tankersley, supposing we agree with you on your main point, what can the district courts or the Ninth Circuit do, if anything, about a situation where a party simply doesn't... fails to call the district court's attention to what may be a controlling case and raises it for the first time on appeal?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,810.256,819.291,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it's a big problem, because the incentives for plaintiffs to cite every possible helpful authority are already there."
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.749,830.43,"Well, but here... here the district court was really mousetrapped."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,846.94,848.532,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.951,859.091,Well--
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,859.091,869.626,"--That is something which follows from the fact that it is the role of appellate courts to correct legal errors, even if they are due to an oversight in the proceedings in the district court."
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.626,873.729,--Well an oversight on the part of counsel who have simply failed to do their job.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,873.729,882.785,"It... it was an oversight on the part of counsel, but it was also a matter of fact that this case was on the books and in opinions that the district court also relied upon."
1993.92-8579,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.787,892.162,"May I ask, Mr. Tankersley, do you understand the Ninth Circuit's rule to apply only to the qualified immunity defense, or is it a general rule that applies to any kind of comparable situation?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,892.162,916.586,"--I understand this rule to apply... to be a interpretation of this Court's language in Davis v. Scherer, and for that reason to apply only to the qualified immunity defense on the basis that they interpreted that language, which says that the plaintiff must show that the law was clearly established, as providing that legal authorities in this unique context are to be treated as if they were matters of fact, legal facts."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.963,974.11,"But certainly the general rule for all sorts of issues... legal issues, that can simply be waived by the district court by not being raised--"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,974.11,974.721,Legal issues--
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.721,982.357,"--Even though the law on it is clear, the court of appeals will say, well, that may be, but we'll treat it as though the law is otherwise simply because you did not bring it to the district court's attention."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,982.357,988.12,"--Legal issues can be raised, but legal issues present a different matter than legal arguments."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.843,1018.684,"Well, that depends--"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1058.812,1063.025,"This goes beyond the record, but that was not the case here."
1993.92-8579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.956,1065.136,Why?
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1068.959,1077.376,"--Your Honor, we acknowledge, and it's clear from the district court opinion, that in order to prevail in this case we have to overcome the exigent circumstances issue."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.677,1207.378,"Well, you can assume the worst."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1218.057,1225.533,But it also... it does answer the question that there is nothing about this rule that serves the interests that are behind qualified immunity.
1993.92-8579,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.813,1367.025,"May I ask you a question about Ninth Circuit practice, Mr. Tankersley?"
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1371.94,1372.781,"Yes, they do."
1993.92-8579,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.781,1374.033,Do they have a no citation rule?
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1374.033,1381.737,I believe the rule is that the opinion cannot be used as authority for subsequent precedents.
1993.92-8579,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.737,1387.492,Do you know what the duty of counsel would be before the district court if he had an unpublished opinion squarely in point?
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1393.054,1395.955,Your Honor--
1993.92-8579,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.955,1397.037,Under the Ninth Circuit rule?
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1397.037,1401.091,--Under the Ninth Circuit rule the... it could not--
1993.92-8579,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.091,1402.981,"On one hand, he's forbidden to cite it and on the other hand he's compelled to cite it."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1402.981,1420.595,"--Well, I think it could not be relied upon for authority and the issue would then arise whether or not an unpublished opinion is relevant for the clearly established determination, which is one that, thankfully, is not presented in this case, and as far as I know has not been addressed by this Court or the courts of appeal."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.595,1438.376,"Mr. Tankersley, on the... on the issue of whether there can be any precedential value to decisions under the Ninth Circuit's regime, as I understand the Ninth Circuit it is not mandatory that you... that you not take account of opinions not cited, it's simply optional."
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1456.927,1477.181,"I disagree with that, in that, as I read the Ninth Circuit opinion, at the appellate level they read this Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer as mandating that the appellate court is not to take into account other decisions that it's aware of, that it believes are relevant, that, in fact, it thinks may be controlling, if those decisions were not cited in the court below."
1993.92-8579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.181,1478.932,Okay.
1993.92-8579,0,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,1478.932,1482.084,"If there are not further questions, I'd like to save the balance of my time for rebuttal."
1993.92-8579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.084,1483.514,"Very well, Mr. Tankersley."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1485.306,1493.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.508,1560.998,"Well, Mr. Davis, the question presented in the petition for certiorari is basically the one I believe Mr. Tankersley was arguing, that is whether the appeals court should be able to disregard legal authorities that were not cited to the district court."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1564.05,1565.673,"I do intend to do that, Your Honor, yes."
1993.92-8579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.673,1566.724,And fairly soon?
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1566.724,1568.544,"I will, Your Honor, thank you."
1993.92-8579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.17,1634.8,"Mr. Davis... I think I speak for my colleagues as well... if the Ninth Circuit had simply decided this qualified immunity issue on the merits one way or the other, we never would have granted certiorari."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1651.291,1665.11,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I will... I'm familiar with the Washington Yakima Indian Nation case, which would allow the party who was successful below to rely on any grounds, but in deference to the Court I will proceed to address the issue."
1993.92-8579,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.801,1699.911,"Well, is it your submission that if there were an identical case to yours in another district court and the Izumi case or the... this Ninth Circuit case had been cited, that the results should be different?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1699.911,1719.215,"The answer to that is, yes, that can happen, but it can happen any time a court of appeals exercises the abuse of discretion standard or any time that a counsel mistakenly doesn't present either a factual basis or a legal basis for their claim."
1993.92-8579,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.215,1727.65,"Well, are rulings of the district court in the Ninth Circuit on the issue of what the clearly established law is, reviewable for abuse of discretion?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1727.65,1729.78,I'm sorry?
1993.92-8579,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.78,1739.538,Are rulings of district courts in the Ninth Circuit on the issue of what is or is not clearly established law reviewable by an abuse of discretion standard?
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1739.538,1742.332,My understanding is that it is a de novo standard.
1993.92-8579,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.332,1746.183,"De novo determination of law, correct?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1746.183,1746.474,That's correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.022,1771.35,"Mr. Davis, could... could this district judge have found that case and applied it on his own and said the law is clearly established?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1771.35,1773.531,"Yes, I believe--"
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.531,1785.359,"So the law... so it really turns on not simply what counsel present, but what the judge found or failed to find on her own and what the law clerk found or missed?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1785.359,1785.97,--Yes.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.97,1796.186,So we get different results for the very same case in different courts depending upon the diligence of the judge and of the law clerk?
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1796.186,1803.922,"Unfortunately, I think that happens in our system, but we already have that unfortunate circumstance as a result of--"
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.922,1813.499,I thought we agreed that this was a special position that the Ninth Circuit has taken with respect to the qualified immunity defense because of that line in the Scherer opinion.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1824.988,1843.588,"--On... as I understand the Ninth Circuit's decision, which we did not request, it was that there is a limited scope of review under the de novo standard whenever the determination is made that the plaintiff did not meet their burden of proof."
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1846.731,1868.406,"And we would apply the same rule... in this case defendant... plaintiff was counseled, but many 1983 cases are brought up pro se prisoners who may not have the latest law reports in the library, and the same thing would go there?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1868.406,1869.567,That's correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.43,1943.503,"So you're going back... you keep talking about burden of proof, so you're treating law as fact then, if you're talking burden of proof language."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1943.503,1945.616,I am not treating it as fact.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1966.243,1975.289,"But you've already said it's really not up to the plaintiff because if the judge had found the law on her own or his own, then the plaintiff could have prevailed."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1975.289,1978.541,"--Certainly, the district court judge has the right to--"
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1978.541,1983.226,But the district judge doesn't have the right to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proof on matters of fact.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,1983.226,1984.795,--That's correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.857,2066.28,"Well, I'm not sure whether the term invited error really applies."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2103.667,2114.253,"I think it's no different, Mr. Chief Justice, than the circumstance where the plaintiff fails to find the appropriate jury instructions and fails to offer them to the district court."
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.949,2134.907,"Of course, this is kind of interesting because both sides failed to call it to the attention of the court, and it'd be relevant on a couple of issues, yet helpful to one on one and helpful to the other on the other."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2137.531,2140.262,I was aware of the decision.
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.103,2145.466,You were aware of it and you did not call it to the district court's attention.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2145.466,2148.838,"I did not argue the case, your honor and I advised--"
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.838,2152.331,But was the person who argued aware of the case and didn't call it to the district court's attention.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2152.331,2152.662,--That is correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.662,2156.425,Was that consistent with normal practice in California?
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2156.425,2157.516,It's in Idaho.
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.516,2158.528,"Idaho, pardon me."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2158.528,2160.879,"No, it isn't."
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.796,2176.459,"Well, I understand it helps you there, but what about your duty as an advisor and an officer of the court?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2183.004,2183.615,Absolutely.
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.615,2184.246,You do.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2187.348,2190.7,In this instance I did not argue the motion and I do not--
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.7,2190.91,All right.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2195.045,2202.889,"--I would have to say, Your Honor, that it is a case that... if I had been there, I would have provided to the district court judge."
1993.92-8579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.278,2218.539,"Sure it's distinguishable, but we affirmed the district court's ruling that Al-Azzawy was arrested inside his residence without a warrant."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2221.021,2235.851,--The... the other circumstance that all of these cases have relied upon is that there was direct excessive coercion which required the person to come outside the residence.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2309.328,2312.84,"Mr. Davis, just... I want to go back to one thing you said."
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2336.948,2338.631,That is correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.511,2373.315,But the... that... that indicates it was the officer who got him to come out of the house and not the brother.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2373.315,2375.426,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.434,2426.601,"You don't see a difference between an officer knocking on the door and asking someone politely to come out and an officer saying to someone inside of a house if you can't stand up, crawl out?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2426.601,2439.82,"--At the time that statement was made the man claimed that he had had a seizure, and the officer was telling him to crawl out so that he didn't risk injury."
1993.92-8579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.374,2506.122,"You agree with petitioners, do you not, that the rule of the Ninth Circuit was a rule that you must not consider it, not that you need not?"
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2506.122,2506.973,That's correct.
1993.92-8579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.973,2509.927,The Ninth Circuit does not let you consider it at all on appeal.
1993.92-8579,1,29889,james_davis,,2509.927,2514.361,That is my understanding under the circumstances of this case.
1993.92-8579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.109,2605.453,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
1993.92-8579,2,36780,michael_e_tankersley,,2607.966,2612.118,"Unless there are any other further questions, I have nothing further."
1993.92-8579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.118,2614.512,"Thank you, Mr. Tankersley."
