1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.438,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-5443, Barnes against the United States."
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,53.163,71.731,Thank you Your Honor.
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,252.445,263.184,"And all the things that you just said true of a large area of what we vaguely call circumstantial evidence, evidence of circumstances?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,274.067,289.113,"It's close with distinctions, naturally circumstantial evidence, you don't have to see the boy eating the cookie, if you see the broken cookie jar, that's the old, the cookie jar analogy."
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,383.787,386.219,Did this petitioner take the stand?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,386.219,387.6,No he did not.
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.268,396.077,"Well, I am looking at page 6 of your brief and I am puzzled."
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,408.659,411.251,Let me state it this way to clear it out Mr. Justice.
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.043,426.078,I see.
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,426.078,431.077,-- and this is the great distinction that I make.
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.549,440.173,"What you are telling me, I gather Mr. Mackey that this paragraph in your brief refers to testimony of the postal inspector."
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,440.173,442.31,That is correct.
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.31,453.544,"Then on page 11, bottom of page 11 in trial, you say, his defense is that certain parties gave him these checks as payment for furniture."
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,454.578,461.77,"Yes, let me enlarge on that, as and I think this is important."
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.239,550.527,Or did he out on any evidence at all?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,550.527,551.612,Nothing.
1972.72-5443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.612,552.303,Nothing.
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,554.519,565.594,"I was -- I had to be Trial Attorney and I cross examined which I naturally has to do, cross examine the -- all we did is cross examine and I think that is the valid distinction."
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,565.594,570.166,You spoke of his putting a stamp on that check and putting it in his bank account.
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,573.37,574.205,"An endorsement, yes."
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,574.205,575.241,-- named payee?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,575.241,576.254,That is correct.
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.254,592.5,"And the evidence in the record is that the handwriting expert said, he signed it and was there not an admission through the postal inspector that he said he had signed the payee's name for the check?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,592.5,594.141,I don't believe there was any admission.
1972.72-5443,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.382,666.397,"Still I am not sure, who signed these checks?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,666.397,666.908,Well --
1972.72-5443,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.908,670.96,Is there any evidence in the record as to who signed them?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,670.96,686.571,"The only evidence in the record on the signing of the checks is the evidence of the handwriting analyst said that these – this, now we are talking on the counts, I am separating the counts of forgery and possession."
1972.72-5443,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,693.001,695.424,And is there anything to the contrary in the record?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,695.424,709.33,"There is nothing to the contrary, no, except cross examination of myself of the handwriting expert and we didn't have at that time, we didn't have our own handwriting expert."
1972.72-5443,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.094,757.853,What all can you ask for?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,757.853,760.005,That's right.
1972.72-5443,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.005,761.47,You are not doing us any favor?
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,763.19,764.653,"Right, well, I realize that."
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,764.653,780.75,"Because your response to Justice Marshall relating to the ""Clarence Smith"" check, is that the check concerning the expert testimony of the handwriting expert?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,780.75,782.735,"There were two checks, I don't know whether it was the let's say --"
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,782.735,794.427,"Well, didn't the postal inspector testify that Barnes admitted forging, signing, the name ""Clarence Smith"" to the checks?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,794.427,795.339,"Well, yes."
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.584,799.723,"Now that's an additional evidence besides the handwriting expert, isn't it?"
1972.72-5443,0,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,799.723,812.318,"Right, we admit if he signed the -- I am looking at this -- Clarence Smith was a name and he admitted, right he admitted signing it to put it in the bank, excuse me that it is correct."
1972.72-5443,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,848.099,850.391,"Very well, Mr. Friedman?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,850.391,853.626,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.361,926.398,That's part of it and then don't you have to go further and say that the inference was that he knew it was stolen from the mail because there was the charge on that?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,926.398,930.045,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, there was not the charge."
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,937.859,938.561,"Well, alright."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,938.561,942.648,We discuss -- he didn't have to know it was stolen from the mail.
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.436,947.149,That In fact it was stolen?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,947.149,948.512,-- that in fact it was stolen.
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,965.474,968.157,The burden now as to show – it has to -- it has the burden.
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,971.911,974.688,"Stolen from the mail, that is correct."
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.016,1127.147,Tons of paper which they didn't --
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1127.147,1134.332,"Which he had no record if, you know, they just put it down on a little piece of scrap paper and he didn't have any record of these furniture sales."
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.332,1135.835,Made by his agents?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1135.835,1139.907,"Made by, made by his agents, yes."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.36,1180.164,How long go is that published?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1180.164,1183.66,This -- the second edition of this book was published in 1970.
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1183.66,1184.29,The First edition?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1184.29,1186.417,"First Edition, I don't know Mr. Justice."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.417,1187.411,I see.
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1187.411,1205.605,"The instruction made it quite clear to the Jury that they would have considered all the evidence from this case, not just the inference that maybe drawn from possession, and that the -- they would have drawn no inference from the defendant's failure to take the stand."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.334,1329.477,Mr. Friedman did the judge then required in his instructions deal with his attempted explanation in the form of a house master?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1329.477,1332.806,"No, he didn't comment on the explanation as such."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1332.806,1333.893,Did he comment generally on any of that?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1333.893,1335.379,"No, he did not generally comment."
1972.72-5443,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.602,1352.683,"Mr. Friedman, did any -- did the petitioner's explanation to the postal inspector include any explanations to why he opened the name of the -- why he used the name Clarence Smith in opening the bank account."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1352.683,1373.93,"That was not brought out before the jury, but there was a colloquy, he explained that he had been on parole at the time, and it was concerned would if his true name came out, it might be difficult for him in his business dealings, but that was not brought up before the jury because of the possible prejudice of his being -- that he was on parole."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.93,1388.616,Are you logging at all that he is really in opposition to attack the instructions since in fact he relies on what the postmaster and the inspector testified as was his explanation?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1388.616,1407.253,"We don't make that argument as such because he did accepted the instruction, what we say is that his claim, his claim that as a result of this instruction -- that this instruction constituted in impermissible comment on his failure to take the stand that that claim seems to be belied by the fact that he relied on the postal inspector --"
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.253,1408.309,As an explanation?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1408.309,1414.37,As an explanation and stated in fact that there was no need for him to take the stand under these circumstances.
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1439.234,1440.765,The court had approved it?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1440.765,1452.171,"Yes, Mr. Justice as recently as 1946 -- I am sorry 1964 in the Rugendorf case which involve the possession of stolen purse."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.171,1465.629,I gather than we should look to this case as though the government had only put into the evidence of the fact that possession plus fact that goods were recently stolen and have been stolen from mail.
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1465.629,1467.499,"No, Mr. Justice it's much more than that."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.499,1472.321,"Well, I know, but – wouldn't that had been enough?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1472.321,1475.677,"That probably would have been enough, but the court didn't so limit these."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.677,1476.89,"Well, I understand that."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1481.979,1485.045,"Yes, we do like that argument, but our position --"
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.045,1486.255,That's the only one?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1486.255,1488.582,"No, we think the instruction is proper."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.582,1493.344,"Alright then, you would make the same argument, if the only evidence there was in the case."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1493.344,1496.373,"If that was the only evidence in the case, the jury may infer --"
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.373,1499.317,And you would say that the instruction nevertheless would be valid?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1499.317,1499.479,Would be valid.
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.479,1507.749,"And the conviction would be valid, if your only evidence was possession, proof of brief and that is was from mail?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1507.749,1511.373,And lack of any explanation.
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.373,1513.134,Record is otherwise is silent?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1513.134,1515.48,But that we think would be enough Mr. Justice.
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1518.646,1524.861,"Well, as I said there is so much more, should we address ourselves to the question of the inference as such?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1527.694,1536.039,"Well, I think only because Mr. Justice and I assume the reason the Court took the cases of the conflicting decision of the Fifth Circuit in the Cameron case."
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.039,1539.706,"The petition of certiorari is pending here in the Cameron case, is it not?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1539.706,1550.029,"No, Mr. Justice, that particular decision has -- I don't believe is pending because that case has been reversed and was retried I understand."
1972.72-5443,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.262,1563.659,There is and you can see the square conflict between this decision by the Court of Appeals and the Cameron case?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1563.659,1572.045,"Yes, the instruction that the Court of Appeals struck down in the Cameron cases, almost a carbon copy to the instruction which the Ninth Circuit here approved."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1572.045,1583.432,"Well, tell Mr. Friedman is it possible, I am not familiar with the Cameron case, but that gather it falls under this hypothetical that Mr. Justice White put to you, is it possible that that case could be affirmed and this one also?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1583.432,1587.341,"I wouldn't think so as it was decided, Mr. Justice. Let me explain."
1972.72-5443,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1587.341,1588.795,Couldn't you draw distinction.
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1593.679,1594.43,"It did, it did."
1972.72-5443,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1594.43,1602.653,And you think the fact that ordinary negotiable currency creates a different fact situation than one of government checks?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1602.653,1608.143,"It might Mr. Justice, expect that the Fifth Circuit in its Cameron decision did not go on that basis."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.522,1721.204,"What do you think the standard is, Mr. Friedman?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1727.542,1731.26,We think it's more likely to not stand it and we certainly do --
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.26,1733.434,And that's from Leary?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1733.434,1737.965,"That's from Leary, I believe, but we think whatever --"
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.965,1740.158,You are willing to accept that standard --
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1740.158,1740.381,More rational --
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.381,1741.096,-- the prejudice?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1741.096,1742.157,Yes.
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.157,1743.042,It's more likely than that?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1743.042,1755.294,"More likely -- the standard we don't accept, the standard we don't think is a sound standard is the question this Court has left open that it has -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the inferred fact flows from the proven fact."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.299,1771.4,"Don't you have to get to my example that I gave a while ago, simply goes the instruction actually was given, and the jury was -- would have been permitted to disbelieve every -- all the other evidence except those basic facts."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1771.4,1771.745,"Well, it could --"
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.745,1776.78,You just don't know what the jury -- the jury might have been relied on just those basic facts?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1776.78,1786.153,"Except, Mr. Justice for the fact that the instruction was qualified by the words ”in the light of the surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in this case.”"
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.153,1793.023,But when you just the say the question just isn't really here as to the validity of these – it's just interference?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1793.023,1795.874,"Of the naked inference itself, we don't think it's here."
1972.72-5443,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.874,1799.068,You don't have to defend that on the basis of this instruction?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1799.068,1805.732,"No, that's correct and I am perfectly happy to defend that, but it seems to me, we don't have to defend it on this instruction."
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1806.455,1811.206,"Why in fact Mr. Friedman under the -- is the issue really here, why do we have to decide it?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1811.206,1815.613,"Well, we -- Mr. Justice we opposed the petition for certiorari in this case --"
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1815.613,1819.039,"Well, perhaps this could -- [Laughter]"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1819.039,1821.672,"We do, we usually do, but we suggested in this case --er"
1972.72-5443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1821.672,1824.962,Well as this a candidate for dismissal as improvidently granted?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1824.962,1827.277,"I would think, it would be appropriate Mr. Justice."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.227,1849.899,I don't know that that effects you with the -- that -- those words in that instruction really save it in a sense that the Jury still could have disbelieved everything except the fact of possession?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1849.899,1858.061,"Yeah the jury could have Mr. Have Mr. Justice but there jury was instructed, it had to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt, every element of the offense."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.061,1865.796,"Of possession, of the fact that it was recently stolen and the fact it was recently stolen from the mail, that's all it had to really believe?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1865.796,1874.978,"That's all it had to believe, but I think we must assume however that the jury did follow the court's instruction, that is, looking to all the circumstances of the case."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.978,1877.908,"Well, I know but it didn't have to believe it."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1887.509,1898.74,"It could have, but there is no reason to think Mr. Justice that in deciding to draw the inference and the court stressed that the jury was not required to draw the inference, but it was within it's discretion."
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.937,1914.319,"Well, then that tihs case suggested that the prosecutor and the prosecution suggested to the judge that at least that prosecution shouldn't submit."
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1914.319,1915.879,No we don't know.
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.641,1920.486,You mean you wouldn't like the abandoned instructions and facts like that?
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1920.486,1925.979,"No, no we think this is a very strong case on the fact."
1972.72-5443,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.493,1977.777,"Well, we well recall which did as Mr. Justice White said as usual opposed the grant of the petition, but now that it's here in light of the Fifth Circuit, is this in your view something that ought to be clarified for the benefit of the Fifth Circuit, if no one else?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1977.777,1980.128,I would think so Mr. Justice.
1972.72-5443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.682,2010.315,"Then you say that this case that we had before us, really isn't unique, that there really isn't conflict of this sort?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2010.315,2025.635,"I thought I have made that clear Mr. Justice, there is conflict in that, the Fifth Circuit found inadequate and improper virtually the identical instruction to that which the judge gave in this case and which the Ninth Circuit proved."
1972.72-5443,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.635,2031.039,"And approximately one-third of all the Federal district judges in the country are bound by the Fifth Circuit holding, are they not?"
1972.72-5443,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2031.039,2040.258,A large -- I don't know the exact -- I wouldn't be at all surprised Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-5443,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2040.258,2041.369,Mr. Mackey do you have any thing further?
1972.72-5443,2,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,2041.369,2044.237,"Yes, I want to just make a few comments."
1972.72-5443,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2044.237,2049.487,By the way your citations of the Standford Law is not --
1972.72-5443,2,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,2049.487,2055.831,"I have the exact -- I have the book from the library, here Your Honor, excuse me."
1972.72-5443,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2065.69,2066.82,"You said, 23?"
1972.72-5443,2,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,2066.82,2069.592,Excuse me.
1972.72-5443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2069.592,2070.481,22
1972.72-5443,2,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,2070.481,2081.15,"22, yes and it is a very comprehensive tridus of the whole thing going in the rational connection test and in the whole (Inaudible)."
1972.72-5443,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.741,2110.033,"But the Leary case involved a presumption and not an inference, did it not?"
1972.72-5443,2,36377,malcolm_h_mackey,,2110.033,2119.664,"It did, but as the Roger's case against it, no matter what we call it, it still creates a hardship."
1972.72-5443,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2217.849,2218.533,Thank you gentleman.
