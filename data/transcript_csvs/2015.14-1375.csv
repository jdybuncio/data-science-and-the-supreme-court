2015.14-1375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.73,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1375, CRST Van Expedited v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Smith."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,10.73,20.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On the issue we initially asked this Court to resolve in the petition for certiorari, the parties are now in complete agreement."
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,89.795,99.08,"Isn't the standard whether the EEOC's actions were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,99.08,101.045,"That's the Christiansburg standard, yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,101.045,107.58,So what difference does it make on what ground it was dismissed?
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,107.58,109.57,I couldn't agree more.
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.57,124.145,"I've been reading these briefs, and with or without prejudice, merits, non-merits, I don't know that even if a judge gets to that point of deciding whether it was on the merits or not, that's not enough."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,126.89,127.41,Right.
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.5,145.735,There wasn't the slightest suggestion of any frivolity or groundlessness to this complaint.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,145.735,152.99,"Your Honor, there certainly is. As the case turned out, they never had any foundation whatever for bringing this class claim."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.735,166.554,"They -- the claim was that many women had been harassed by lead drivers, not one, but many."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,166.554,168.99,"That was -- that was the allegation, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.31,195.455,"I thought that was the whole thing, that the -- the -- that the company was not giving the lead drivers adequate training."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,199.725,200.36,Your Honor --
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.36,214.365,"That was -- that was the complaint about the employer, that there were complaints about these lead drivers, and the -- and the employer just didn't take them seriously."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,214.365,222.2,"But what became clear as the case proceeded is that, A, the EEOC never investigated any kind of pattern or practice at the investigatory phase."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,244.3,256.08,"The EEOC, when it was investigating this case, asked CRST, tell us about complaints you've gotten of sexual harassment."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,261.059,262.48,Your Honor --
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.48,264.27,There were well over a hundred.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,264.27,284.39,"Your Honor, the -- the EEOC's suggestion that we did not answer their question completely was looked at in detail both by the district court and by the Eighth Circuit, and they both concluded that the only -- the question at issue was a question about people who had complained about the conduct at issue in this case, meaning Ms. Starke -- Ms. Starke's harassment."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.12,325.415,"Is it so that, when you were initially asked how many complaints have you gotten or tell us the names of the people who have complained, they came up with two people?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,325.415,327.18,It is true that they named two people.
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.37,329.65,"That wasn't accurate, was it?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,329.65,340.53,"Well, that wasn't the question. The question that we were answering was people who had complained about the particular issue in the charge. And so as Judge Reed concluded, we gave them more information than the EEOC requested."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,470.32,476.725,"Well, you're here complaining about a threshold question."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,489.885,491.235,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,590.84,595.35,So that all gets to the reasonableness or unreasonableness point.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,622.705,626.07,I think they have -- they've said the merits issue is not really relevant.
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,662.79,675.67,"Mr. Smith, understanding that you think that, but if we could just go on from that, what is wrong with that position? And do you have a substitute test, or -- or is there no substitute test, in your view?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,675.67,679.95,"Well, Your Honor, as -- as to the first question, the first problem with the argument is it's factually not true."
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,682.1,682.32,Right.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,683.75,684.57,Okay.
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,727.37,733.155,Even if the -- even if the reason for the dismissal -- for the dismissal is completely curable?
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,733.155,751.08,"Well, it's curable perhaps, but there are going to be situations -- and this case is a good illustration -- where you can't get rid of the fact that you've spent lots and lots of money litigating claims which, if they'd been -- been investigated and had to make reasonable cause findings and been conciliated, likely would never have seen court to begin with."
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,759.855,772.01,"But -- but then you're suggesting that whatever the reason for the dismissal is, with prejudice, without prejudice, for any reason whatsoever, curable or not, it's up to the discretion of the Court?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,772.01,780.21,"I -- I guess I would -- given the severity of the Christiansburg standard, I'm -- it's not clear to -- clear to me that -- that you can't trust district judges in those situations."
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.03,801.395,"In -- in this case as to, I guess, the 67 women that the Court -- before it goes to the court of appeals on round number one, says the Court bars the EEOC from seeking relief."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,801.395,802.3,"Yes, sir."
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.3,806.535,"Is that a phrase district courts use often, ""bars""?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,806.535,840.16,"You know, I think it was invented by the judge here because she's dealing with a rather peculiar animal, which is a one-count complaint which says Ms. Starke was sexually harassed and it was not appropriately handled, and a class of people were sexually harassed and it was not appropriately handled. And they start bringing these things in, and to the extent that -- at that point in the case, they're trying to litigate them as individual claims. And the -- so rather than dismiss the -- the claims, she said individuals -- when they were litigating on their own behalf, she would dismiss the -- the claim with prejudice, but she would tell the EEOC, You're barred from litigating this claim, this claim, and this claim."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.89,883.95,"With respect to those 67, I thought we had held that in Mach Mining, that the remedy for inadequate conciliation, investigation and conciliation, is not dismissal, but return to continue the efforts to conciliate."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,883.95,890.7,"What you held in Mach Mining, Your Honor, is that where there is a failure of conciliation, the appropriate remedy is a stay so they can conciliate some more."
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,923.13,943.54,"Mr. Smith, do you understand her order as -- as saying that if the EEOC did engage in conciliation, had made the initial findings, had satisfied all the pre-suit requirements, could the EEOC, do you think, have come back and brought those individual claims?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,943.54,947.51,Certainly I -- I think she was very clear that that was not available to them --
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,947.51,952.59,Even after filing the pre-suit requirements? Even after satisfying the pre-suit requirements?
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,952.59,952.72,Yes.
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,961.28,963.3,"Why didn't she say ""with prejudice,"" then?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,963.3,964.83,"Well, she does eventually, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,979.83,980.3,Why -- why isn't it --
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,980.3,983.995,"But back in 2009, she didn't say that."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,990.925,991.16,Right.
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,991.16,992.74,She did not include that language.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,992.74,995.6,She didn't use that language. She said the government shall take nothing in the judgment.
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1066.84,1079.705,"But if I understand, their motion did not say now we've satisfied all our pre-suit requirements, right? So she might just have said, well, you still haven't satisfied your pre-suit requirements, so of course I'm not changing anything."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1079.705,1080.42,"Well, Your Honor, there's --"
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1080.42,1087.27,The question is what would have happened if the government came back and said we have satisfied the pre-suit requirements.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1099.49,1100.46,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.71,1122.35,"Where is that? There's a piece of paper called ""the judgment"" somewhere."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1123.54,1164.7,"But you see if you look at the Joint Appendix -- first of all, I'm at Joint Appendix, Your Honors -- there is a judgment that appears on page 115 and 116 which says, ""Judgment is entered in accordance with the attached."" And the attached is an order of dismissal which was negotiated by the parties. And if you look at the bottom of 118a, the order of dismissal, which was incorporated in the judgment, at the bottom of 118a it says, ""Based on EEOC's withdrawal of its claim on behalf of Tillie Jones, the parties' settlement of EEOC's claim on behalf of Monika Starke and the mandate issued by the court of appeals on September 14, 2012, with respect to all other claims asserted by the EEOC, this case is dismissed with prejudice."""
2015.14-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.7,1167.075,"That's the end of it, isn't it? It was dismissed with prejudice."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1167.075,1169.08,"That's the point, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1169.08,1170.89,There doesn't seem to be any doubt about it.
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.98,1185.13,"Mr. Smith, what is -- what's -- what are you asking us to do in this case? What's the disposition that you're seeking?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1185.13,1185.73,"Well, you should --"
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1185.73,1193.845,"Are we supposed to say Eighth Circuit, you're wrong, it has nothing to do with -- exclusively with the merits? Do a do-over?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1193.845,1197.45,"That's -- that's the issue we should -- you should certainly reverse them on, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1217.68,1235.745,"Mr. Smith -- Mr. Smith, will you explain why ""dismiss this case with prejudice"" isn't talking about the case that was settled, the Starke case? The -- there were -- all the other women were out of it; it was down to two women; one dropped out; one was left."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1239.68,1264.06,"Well, it refers to her case; it refers to the Tillie Jones case, and to all the other claims asserted by the EEOC under a one-count complaint. There is no separate count for each of these people. And so when you dismiss that count, it expressly says, ""With respect to all the other claims asserted by the EEOC,"" I think it's pretty obvious that the case is dismissed with prejudice with respect to all the claims asserted by the EEOC, including the 67, Your Honor. That was --"
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1264.06,1274.52,"All the claims that were then being litigated by the EEOC, which did not include the claims that had previously been dismissed for failure to satisfy the pre-suit requirements."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1274.52,1282.385,"It's a basic principle that a judgment at the end of the merits phase goes back and incorporates all the -- the prior rulings of the court, and is based on the prior rulings in which --"
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1282.385,1307.174,"I think that's not -- it's not right, if the prior ruling was based on a curable dismissal and the EEOC had simply done nothing with respect to that set of claims, neither cured it nor renounced the possibility that they would cure it. In 2013, the court was facing a much reduced set of claims in a different suit."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1307.174,1312.63,"Your Honor, I think that -- that the judgment is going to go back and cover everything that happened in the case."
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1338.04,1340.445,So why should we decide this?
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1340.445,1341.12,"Well, I think it --"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1341.12,1348.21,"Why don't we just remand it completely, and let the Eighth Circuit decide, or the district court decide what it meant?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1348.21,1352.78,"Well, you should certainly decide the issue that was -- we brought you here, which is the circuit conflict --"
2015.14-1375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.78,1368.825,"Assuming we reverse, why don't we leave it to the court below to decide whether they will, in fact, entertain the government's new argument because there might be a waiver of that, or whether there's a factual predicate for it at all?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1368.825,1369.83,"We could do that, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1404.06,1410.755,"On that one -- on that one issue, was -- the amount awarded some $4 million."
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1419.54,1421.82,I think the Starke issue gets -- gets separated out.
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.63,1432.175,"But there were -- but there -- in other words, this was not 100 percent of the fees? There was --"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1432.175,1432.94,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.94,1435.045,The fees were separated out.
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1435.045,1438.34,"First of all, they were Cedar Rapids rates, and we charge Chicago rates."
2015.14-1375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1493.275,1502.115,"Mr. Smith, do you think it's possible to have a pattern of practice appropriate class claim with respect to sexual harassment?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1502.115,1503.23,"I do, Your Honor."
2015.14-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1543.98,1561.48,"Couldn't you have a pattern and practice case of saying there -- there are -- all these complaints were made, and the employer didn't take them seriously, he either did nothing or gave the -- the driver a slap on the wrist?"
2015.14-1375,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1561.48,1572.32,"Your Honor, I think you can have a -- a standard operating procedure that you show by saying over and over again they don't do what they're supposed to do and that their policies are not taken seriously."
2015.14-1375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.91,1604.37,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1604.37,1637.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question on what this Court granted certiorari is not, as Mr. Smith suggested, and has been the basis for his waiver arguments, whether or not the Eighth Circuit was correct to say that a Title VII defendant has to prevail on the merits in order to secure a fee award and to be a prevailing party. Instead, the question that petitioner framed in the petition and the question on what this Court granted certiorari is whether the dismissal of a Title VII case, based on the EEOC's failure to satisfy its pre-suit investigations, can form the basis for an award of attorneys' fees."
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1637.4,1641.355,"In your brief in opposition, you argued that the Eighth Circuit was correct; did you not?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1641.355,1641.86,We did.
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.26,1643.99,Have you abandoned that argument?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1643.99,1647.95,We're advancing a slightly different argument that yields the same answer on the question presented.
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1647.95,1652.6,Have you abandoned the argument that there must be an evaluation of the merits?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1652.6,1655.015,"We are -- we're making a slightly different argument, yes."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1655.015,1657.67,"You have abandoned it, was the question."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1657.67,1658.12,Well --
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.12,1659.35,Yes or no?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1659.35,1663.695,We have abandoned the Eighth Circuit's view that you need a disposition on the merits.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.695,1663.98,Thank you.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1663.98,1673.195,But I think in explaining -- I don't think that the change in our argument and -- the change in our argument to a different argument that's still within the scope of the question presented constitutes a waiver.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1680.3,1684.29,"I don't care if it -- I mean, that's up to you, what you want to argue."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1699.83,1700.01,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1700.01,1701.52,"He has to meet the other standard, too."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1701.52,1701.935,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.935,1703.73,I would think the answer is obviously yes.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1716.955,1729.025,"Sir, I'd like to talk about the dismissal with prejudice, which is a -- a case-specific issue here that I -- I do want to address. But I think first, I want to talk about the broader question, which is what makes a party a prevailing party? Because this Court addressed that in its Buckhannon decision."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.48,1747.615,"Can't a plaintiff be a prevailing party? I don't know the answer, but I thought the plaintiff brings a suit charging, you know, serious discrimination."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1762.84,1764.42,"Well, under Buckhannon, it depends."
2015.14-1375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1790.71,1791.16,"You see, I found --"
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.16,1796.34,I suppose that the settlement agreements often take into account liability for attorneys' fees --
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1796.34,1796.615,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.615,1798.07,-- how they are going to apportion those.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1798.07,1799.305,"Very often, yes."
2015.14-1375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1799.305,1810.635,"Why do we apply the same standard to a defendant? The plaintiff is seeking a change of the status quo, but a defendant is actually -- all they want is the status quo."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1826.43,1833.36,"So what the defendant was seeking, though, was a judicial declaration that essentially ratifies the status quo, that -- that ends the dispute."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.88,1862.375,I don't know where that -- where that artificial line comes from.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1877.6,1885.61,"Well, I -- I think that's -- that's right, but I think that what the defendant wants -- and I think this is perhaps expressed best, of all the cases we cite, in Judge Easterbrook's opinion in the Steel Co. case."
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1901.79,1908.28,"There is a material alteration in their relationship, is it not? I mean, it's not as big a one as the defendant would like."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1929.74,1938.39,"I'm sure the defendant would be happy about that, in much the same way a party would be happy if they secured the reversal of a directed verdict on appeal or if they defeated a motion for summary judgment."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.355,1955.645,"Oh, well, this is not interlocutory."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2018.74,2024.63,"I wouldn't go that far, but I do think it's a different view, and a very different view, than the one that all of the courts of appeals that have considered --"
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.63,2029.52,"Well, then they might -- I mean, unfortunately, I a.m. in the position of having to decide it. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.52,2031.72,So I put the question to you.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2051.82,2061.98,"So I think because when a defendant prevails on this sort of round because the plaintiff, say, withdraws the claim voluntarily or secures a dismissal with prejudice, the dispute really isn't over."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.57,2092.31,What if they don't? What if they don't come back the next day? What if they don't sue in the next district? Then it seems to me the purposes of this fee-shifting provision have not been served.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2092.31,2094.475,"Well, I -- I don't think that's quite right."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.16,2143.675,"Well, there -- because -- now, there's much to recommend what you're saying, saying at least if you come back the next day, at least if you could sue in another district."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2180.35,2180.87,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.87,2185.05,"-- versus the simplicity of saying, well, that ended this case."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2189.145,2200.51,"So, I guess, to the -- to the administrative point, I do think the -- the views that the circuits, and the views that the circuits have been applying for 16 years, in some cases more now, ought to be persuasive? Not just because that's what the circuit --"
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.51,2201.15,I didn't say that.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2202.335,2211.83,"But -- but just in -- in the notion that if the sort -- if our rule was going to cause problems of administration like you suggest, you would expect to see it in the circuits, and I don't think you're seeing that in the circuits."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.82,2242.1,"Wouldn't it be an adequate response to your concern if fees were awarded solely on the ground in which the case was dismissed? That would be -- in other words, the judge would have the discretion to do that."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2292.525,2295.01,"Sir, I think that's a better, a more sensible rule."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.24,2320.345,"Well, then that may be a case contrary to the proposal where it's that discreet."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2331.66,2332.41,"Well, first of all --"
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.41,2334.3,It's sort of intertwined with the merits.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2335.565,2341.87,"Well, I -- I'm not sure that's -- that's right, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, we -- we disagree that we were frivolous in thinking we satisfied our pre-suit obligations."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.29,2366.37,Yeah.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2372.09,2384.3,"Well, I -- I'm not sure that's right, in that if Petitioner had raised this early on -- and I -- I do want to be clear, that from the outset in this litigation, I disagree a little bit with what Mr. Smith said about what the EEOC looked into in its investigation."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2395.3,2395.47,Wait.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2406.295,2421.345,"Yes, I take that point. If -- if you resolved the question against us, you say a defendant could be a prevailing party when it prevails on this sort of ground that doesn't foreclose for litigation, then I absolutely agree with you that it would be perfectly appropriate and -- and indeed, I think a good idea for the district court to engage in this kind of inquiry."
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2423.46,2428.39,"So -- so as I understand your answer, let's assume a hypothetical case, not this case."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2445.6,2445.895,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2445.895,2447.15,Doesn't say with prejudice or without.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2447.15,2447.705,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.705,2450.125,Could fees be awarded in that case?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2450.125,2451.6,"I believe, no."
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.06,2458.8,Because he didn't say with -- with prejudice?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2458.8,2468.01,"Because that sort of dismissal under principles of res judicata, under this Court's interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41, when you have -- even after extended litigation --"
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.01,2473.815,"Incidentally, is it clear that after this time that there was no time bar if they had come back again?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2473.815,2474.48,That's right.
2015.14-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.98,2496.595,"So then, your position that no matter how unreasonable the plaintiff has been, no matter how costly it's been, no matter how long it's taken, that you cannot award fees unless the case -- and then the case is dismissed, and the judge says you're barred from bringing this claim in this suit, no fees; that's your position."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2496.595,2497.58,That's correct.
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2503.84,2527.405,"Well, and that's -- in a case like that, what if the -- the EEOC after that dismissal goes back and looks at these cases and says, you know what, we really have nothing here, and therefore, chooses not to bring the case, you would say that because the -- because the first case was dismissed without prejudice, there could be no fees?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2527.405,2529.12,"I -- I would, and I think that follows --"
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2529.12,2530.235,What sense does that make?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2530.235,2531.71,I think it follows from Buckhannon.
2015.14-1375,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2570.96,2574.115,I guess I just don't see what functional sense that makes.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2597.38,2600.23,"Well, I do think it's pretty close to foreclosed by Buckhannon."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.88,2636.415,"Then what is the argument? I take it your argument now is what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Buckhannon says that a plaintiff can't recover, even if he litigates to death and they find -- give up and pay him a billion dollars."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2658.1,2658.92,"Yes, that's correct."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.92,2659.01,Okay.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2670.045,2670.56,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.76,2768.485,"Now, so what you're saying is in -- the judge said they cannot precede again in this case?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2768.485,2771.545,They cannot seek relief on behalf of these 67 women in this case.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.545,2780.775,And why -- why isn't that prevailing? Why aren't they prevailing? What -- they may not prevail in another case or -- that's your argument?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2780.775,2782.55,So that -- that's my argument.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2782.55,2787.025,"Because they have engaged in -- under your theory, they have engaged in an illegal practice."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2792.54,2794.68,They -- they may be sued by us in another case.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2809.7,2809.86,What -- --
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2809.86,2810.41,-- and come back to court.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2810.41,2815.47,"What do you -- yeah, I -- what do you think the significance of Mach Mining is on this issue?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2815.47,2821.25,So our view is that Mach Mining suggests that this issue shouldn't come up again in future cases.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2827.79,2837.07,"Then why isn't that -- I mean, if -- if the EEOC doesn't do anything at all -- I mean, under Mach Mining, if they don't conciliate, the remedy is go conciliate."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2837.07,2837.71,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.71,2859.64,"Wouldn't -- wouldn't you think if the reason they're -- didn't -- it was frivolous for them to bring the suit without conciliation, you know, if somebody said, Well, we've got to conciliate, and they said, Oh, forget about it, go ahead, why wouldn't fees be a perfectly appropriate sanctions? In other words, there's no -- under some sense, there's no incentive for them to conciliate, because if it turns out they didn't, they have to go conciliate."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2867.64,2870.21,So I think I -- I'd like to quibble with the premise.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2889.0,2892.685,"So you're not likely to be subject to this sanction in many cases, which is a good thing."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2892.685,2892.84,Right.
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.84,2894.625,But sometimes -- okay.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2894.625,2908.815,"But I take your point, that then the question is, so if the EEOC -- let's -- by hypothesis, should -- unreasonably fails to satisfy its conciliation obligation, and the court finds that to be the case, and then it stays, pursuant to Mach Mining, and sends them off to conciliate, could the court award fees, I take it to be the question."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.815,2909.03,Right.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2909.03,2915.52,I think the answer is it couldn't do it under this provision because everyone agrees that you have to be a prevailing party to get fees under this provision.
2015.14-1375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2929.38,2959.92,It's hard to imagine that the district court didn't consider this a dismissal with prejudice when it announced in this very decision you're pointing to that the -- that the Petitioner was a prevailing party entitled to attorneys' fees at the end of the case. Certainly the district court thought it was imposing a sanction.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2964.565,2966.9,"At -- at least at this trial, I -- I agree with that."
2015.14-1375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.71,2984.06,"Well, the --"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2984.06,2984.91,It doesn't specify its effect.
2015.14-1375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2984.91,2995.47,"-- the real problem for you is that any -- the dismissal of the action, even according to this order by the court, would happen at the end of the case."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3004.49,3009.94,"So I -- I disagree with that, that you're talking about the dismissal ultimately entered after remand in 2013."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.43,3045.515,"Just simply, No. 279, 10/1/2009, judgment in favor of CSRT against the EEOC?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3045.515,3047.26,"I believe so, yes."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.26,3047.55,Okay.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3048.505,3053.74,So the -- the judgment that is actually entered is I think not in the Joint Appendix.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.9,3056.57,"Well, I mean -- but where do I find it?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3056.57,3060.35,You find it at Docket Entry No. 279 on the district court's docket.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3060.35,3061.165,What does it say?
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3061.165,3063.1,"It says, ""Decision by the court."
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.995,3073.81,The action is dismissed.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3073.81,3074.24,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.71,3100.495,"Except -- it has three exceptions: Lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3100.495,3100.85,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.85,3102.65,This was not failure to join a party.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3102.65,3102.925,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.925,3104.495,It is not improper venue.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3104.495,3104.865,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.865,3106.76,I don't think it's lack of jurisdiction.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3108.685,3117.355,"It's exactly that because in this Court's decision in Costello, the Court said jurisdiction in Rule 41 doesn't mean lack of jurisdiction over the parties."
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3136.29,3141.55,"Mr. Fletcher, could I -- could I take you back to where you started, which is whether you've waived all of this?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3141.55,3142.2,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3142.2,3155.79,"And, you know, you point out that the question presented includes your argument, but clearly it is, as you say, a different argument from the one you litigated below, both in the district court and in the circuit court."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3155.79,3156.145,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3156.145,3172.79,"And in the bio that you filed here. And Mr. Smith has responded to this new argument in less than a page, which is really his every right to do, given that it has sort of sprung from your head at this late date."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3177.04,3179.12,So if I could address it separately.
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.63,3191.815,"Well, you can always file a footnote, you know? I mean --"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3191.815,3197.13,"Well, that -- that's true, but I guess that -- that argument doesn't do Mr. Smith much good because he didn't make that argument."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3216.71,3230.985,"We -- what is the -- I suppose I should know, but, I mean, what is the general practice? I mean, it would be kind of futile to go before the Eighth Circuit and say we think you should overrule your precedent, at least on the panel decision. But that doesn't mean they're not free to raise the argument here."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3234.635,3235.41,Absolutely.
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3293.25,3305.22,"Well, regardless of whether there's blame on either part, we're still in a situation where it really has not been briefed by one party, and it hasn't been thought about by the courts below."
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3312.44,3312.91,Yes.
2015.14-1375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.705,3339.695,"Mr. Fletcher, is it your view that all of this discussion of prevailing parties is really academic because there's no way that the EEOC could satisfy the Christiansburg standard?"
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3339.695,3341.8,"I think I agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3347.99,3349.24,That seems even worse.
2015.14-1375,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3368.94,3371.61,"Well, you don't -- you certainly don't have to resolve it on the merits."
2015.14-1375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3417.12,3420.655,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Smith, you have three minutes remaining."
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3420.655,3435.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, on the question of Buckhannon and this idea that we have to show a change in the legal relationship between the parties, the -- the first thing that Buckhannon says is the paradigm of a -- a case where there's been a prevailing party is where a judgment has been entered."
2015.14-1375,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.295,3490.59,"It said it may -- may result, not would result."
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3490.59,3490.71,"No, no."
2015.14-1375,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3540.815,3548.2,Did she hold that they would have to investigate and conciliate each individual claim?
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3548.2,3551.93,She said that where there is not a valid pattern or practice.
2015.14-1375,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3586.42,3604.765,What is the rule that you would like us to announce? When is it right to award prevailing defendants attorneys' fees?
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3604.765,3605.24,When they --
2015.14-1375,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.24,3606.205,What would be your rule?
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3606.205,3610.6,"When they've won a judgment and prevailed, and where the --"
2015.14-1375,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3610.6,3612.4,It doesn't matter with or without prejudice?
2015.14-1375,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3612.4,3627.94,"I would -- I would think that that should not be in the rule, that that ought to be something within the discretion of the district judge for a lot of the reasons we've been discussing here. And where the -- the claim that -- that was dismissed was frivolous or unreasonable or without foundation under Christiansburg."
2015.14-1375,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3638.855,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
