1985.84-1503,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,We will hear arguments first this morning in Chicago Teachers Union against Hudson.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,11.808,16.86,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1985.84-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.046,291.116,"Would you say the Court of Appeals said that, even though the substantive result reached was right, there still was a procedural component that was separate from that?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,291.116,293.835,"--Yes, indeed, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.267,330.277,"Well, Mr. Gold, I thought that the Court of Appeals did indicate, though, that some... give some opinion as to what could be included in the share that the employee would have to pay?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,330.277,353.892,"The Court of Appeals noted in passing that the objector's rights included not only a right not to pay for political and ideological activity, but also a right not to pay for any activity which is not germane to--"
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.892,355.858,"That's pretty substantive, isn't it?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,355.858,366.45,"--It is substantive, but it isn't presented in this case, and the court indicated as much, because the state statute--"
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.45,370.735,Don't you think that was just gratuitous dicta?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,370.735,383.578,"--I would hate to use the word ""gratuitous"", but I certainly believe that the way the Seventh Circuit approached the case, it was dictum, not only because of what it--"
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.578,391.316,"But some arbitrator, if this procedure holds, would probably follow it, wouldn't he?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,391.316,403.223,"--Hopefully, the arbitrator wouldn't be faced with that because the decision ought not and we hope will not--"
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.223,404.408,Be affirmed.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,404.408,405.208,--hold.
1985.84-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,654.387,657.941,"Mr. Gold, may I inquire of you."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,718.812,730.87,"--That approach would be less burdensome on the individual, but--"
1985.84-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.87,733.239,On the First Amendment right.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,733.239,755.855,"--I don't believe that it is fair to say that it would be less burdensome on the First Amendment right than the escrow system, because the First Amendment right is the right not to subsidize a First Amendment activity with which one disagrees."
1985.84-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.489,809.589,"Well, exactly."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,822.38,827.201,It isn't... in our view--
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.201,834.688,There would still be the question of whether the individual has to pay anything while that determination goes on.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,845.495,850.149,--You've solved several different--
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.149,854.518,Not pending the decision as to how much you should pay.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,854.518,861.088,"--Justice White, you've solved several interests."
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.989,887.122,Anything at all?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,887.122,889.455,--Yes.
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.631,906.598,And the union's interests.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,906.598,907.25,--That's right.
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.602,945.106,"And you may never be able to recover it, because you may not be able to go back, go back and collect what you--"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,945.106,977.31,"That's right, and that's why, as I was going to note, in Abood the Court said that the proper approach here was to prevent compulsory subsidization of ideological activity by employees who object thereto, while not restricting the union's ability to require every employee to contribute to the costs of collective bargaining activities."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.846,989.118,"--Let me just ask at this point, doesn't the escrow, which you seem to be satisfied with, doesn't that also frustrate the governmental interest during the period required to make the determination?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,989.118,990.237,--It does in part.
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.08,1042.702,"Do you agree that the objector has the constitutional right to have the determination of the fair, whatever the allocation may be, at some point be made by an independent decisionmaker?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1042.702,1042.986,We do.
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.986,1053.758,"But you take the position that that could be just the state judicial system that if you put everything in escrow and then waited whatever time it takes the Illinois courts to decide the case, that would be--"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1053.758,1070.719,"Yes, that here, as in any other area that I know of where someone is making a First Amendment claim, if the states... if the state provides an access to the judicial system--"
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.719,1079.575,"--Say the Illinois courts take five or six years to run the route of going through the circuit court, the court of appeals, and all the rest, and all the money sits in escrow for six years."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1082.461,1102.108,"--As the district court pointed out, at the beginning of the process there is going to be some fair room for dispute about whether this category is chargeable or another category is not."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.298,1156.242,"Would you say that system would be constitutionally sufficient even if the union provided no internal mechanism whatsoever for review, if they just off the top of their heads said, we'll take 98 percent this year, we won't have any review, you just have to sue us in court and we'll hold all the money in escrow?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1161.229,1185.011,"I would think that so long as the union on objection holds the money in escrow, both the objector's liberty interests and the objector's property interests are fairly protected."
1985.84-1503,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.371,1264.547,"Mr. Gold, at the beginning of this the question that the Justice gave you said that you pulled this off the top of your head, and you agreed to that, do you?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1264.547,1269.415,"No, I was going to finish my answer, and I thank you, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1503,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.252,1352.002,Mr. Gold.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1352.002,1352.518,--Yes.
1985.84-1503,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1352.518,1369.397,"Excuse me for interrupting, but it would help me if you would clarify a response you made to Justice Stevens, that you agreed that there must be an independent determination of an issue that may be raised by a non-union member as to the use of his or her dues."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1378.569,1380.771,The courts of the state of Illinois.
1985.84-1503,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1380.771,1390.377,"But there's nothing... well, I suppose they could go to arbitration and grievance procedure, but you don't suggest that's independent?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1390.377,1411.456,I'm not arguing here that the union's internal system is one which can replace the individual's right to go to court.
1985.84-1503,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1411.456,1415.492,Would there be any duty to exhaust that possible remedy before going to court?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1415.492,1421.162,That would seem to us to be in the first instance a question of state law.
1985.84-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.248,1456.485,"Well, what if the Illinois courts give the same sort of deference to an arbitrator's decision that the federal courts under the Labor Act do?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1461.139,1480.701,"I would have to say that I think a substantial question would be raised if the objectors could not get a de novo determination, at least on the category questions, namely what categories of union activity is chargeable."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.617,1530.367,"Of course, the state's outer limit isn't much of a limit."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1535.604,1541.841,"--No, I don't believe that by hypothesis some of it is used for non-collective bargaining purposes."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.495,1552.113,"Oh, I see."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1552.113,1553.029,--political activities.
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.029,1553.879,"Right, I see."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1553.879,1560.6,And the union has no organizing expenses because it has one employer and that's the only employer it deals with.
1985.84-1503,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1560.6,1564.921,"Well, Mr. Gold, how do you differ with what the Court of Appeals held?"
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1564.921,1574.859,"We differ with the Court of Appeals in validating this system, which provides every protection that this Court in Ellis said is required."
1985.84-1503,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1574.859,1576.144,What did it invalidate?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1576.144,1585.084,"It invalidated a system whereby the union makes this initial calculation and certification and provides escrow, a union escrow system."
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.3,1591.071,But didn't the union just put in the escrow arrangement after the case started?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1591.071,1592.688,"It did indeed, but--"
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.688,1595.706,But did the Court of Appeals invalidate that?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1595.706,1596.256,--Yes.
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.256,1598.475,But it didn't give it much attention?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1598.475,1607.081,"Well, no, it said it wasn't... we don't believe that the escrow system changes our conclusion, it said."
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.103,1624.559,But you don't... you wouldn't say that... did you answer Justice Stevens that you think the escrow arrangement is constitutionally required?
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1624.559,1654.144,I answered Justice Stevens by saying that where the union makes a prior calculation that it is our judgment that some cushion has to be provided to take care of the eventualities of what the union is actually going to do.
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.144,1661.75,"Well, that may be so, but suppose the union purported to establish a cushion."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1666.036,1666.369,No.
1985.84-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.504,1672.123,That's right.
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1672.123,1679.344,All we're saying is that we approach... this union approached this matter in a suspenders and belt style.
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.729,1692.151,"But as I understand you, maybe I'm wrong, Mr. Gold, but I think you in effect have not challenged the analysis of the Court of Appeals if there were no escrow agreement."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1714.017,1741.834,"If there were no escrow arrangement and all there was was the union's initial sole determination of the amount due without any background of prior experience or prior decisions, we wouldn't challenge the Court of Appeals' determination."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.142,1760.312,"Well, I understand that the practicality, I suppose, is because of the problem of collecting from people who don't pay their share, is that you have to make the 95 percent."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1764.866,1765.833,"Well, that's right."
1985.84-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.341,1810.145,"All of which... I don't mean to retrace ground, but all of which comes back to a question Justice O'Connor asked earlier."
1985.84-1503,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1819.334,1830.975,"Well, I don't think that anybody looking at this from the union perspective is interested in delay."
1985.84-1503,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.423,1858.161,Mr. Vieira.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1858.161,1861.363,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.527,1913.129,"Well, the Court of Appeals didn't think it was beside the point."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1913.129,1915.081,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals has--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.081,1917.597,"Well, are you defending the Court of Appeals' opinion or not?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1917.597,1918.366,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.899,1920.433,Are you?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1920.433,1921.099,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.884,1927.384,Do you defend needless complications?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1927.384,1930.103,"Well, I wasn't responsible for writing the opinion."
1985.84-1503,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.103,1931.769,Sometimes judges talk too much?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1931.769,1942.827,"Well, it seems to me this case would have been approached simply by saying, money is being taken for legitimate purpose; is the procedure involved in the taking constitutional?"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.093,1998.497,Even if... and I take it then we should just... you suggest we just analyze it as a property case?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1998.497,2002.532,"Well, I think you can do that without ever getting into any--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.532,2007.436,"Well, you say the First Amendment issues are all beside the point, so it's a property case."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2014.34,2016.423,"--Well, I think you need the neutral decisionmaker."
1985.84-1503,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.183,2066.606,"Well, Mr. Vieira, I have a difficult time understanding how there could be a due process issue here that's independent of the First Amendment concern."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2080.865,2085.269,"Well, the First Amendment comes into this, Justice O'Connor, if we look at the use."
1985.84-1503,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.112,2106.183,That's the whole underlying purpose of the protections in the scheme that we're reviewing.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2109.052,2115.206,--But what I'm saying is I don't think that that question would be relevant to the taking issue.
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.732,2217.904,"You, I take it you are saying that you must have a prior hearing or some prior participation in the procedure before they could take a nickel?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2217.904,2221.023,I think there has to be some pre-taking process.
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.027,2234.533,"I suppose you would say that, until that... until you have exhausted all of your rights, they can't take a nickel."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2239.77,2241.237,"No, in theory not necessarily, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.237,2242.972,"Well, not necessarily."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2247.191,2249.793,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.609,2265.052,"Well, they have some internal union procedures in which non-consenting employees can participate and those procedures are exhausted, and you just disagree wholly with whatever the decision is."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2265.052,2269.17,"--Oh, I don't think these employees can be required to exhaust any internal union procedures whatsoever."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.245,2291.518,"Well, then you say that you should be able to go to court and have, pending trial, you should have an injunction against collecting any money?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2291.518,2297.789,"Well, I don't think in this case that it's the burden on the employee to have to initiate a court suit."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.899,2339.6,"And until that agency decided, they couldn't collect anything?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2339.6,2340.1,--That's right.
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.658,2354.074,"You're really opposed to paying dues at all, aren't you?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2354.074,2354.943,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.943,2358.828,Your clients are really opposed to paying dues at all?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2358.828,2369.119,"Well, I don't know particularly what the personal preference of my clients are, but they're required to pay these dues under Abood to the extent that the dues meet collective bargaining costs."
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.119,2373.154,"Well, you said that the union should have to go to court before collecting any dues?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2373.154,2374.787,"Who should have to go, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.787,2376.023,The union.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2376.023,2377.239,"Oh, no, no."
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.76,2383.343,In order to collect dues?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2383.343,2384.962,In order to begin this collection process.
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.962,2385.962,What's that?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2385.962,2388.83,"In order to begin this collection process, yes, they should have to--"
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.83,2391.116,In order to collect all dues?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2394.484,2397.203,--To collect the fee to which they're entitled under this statute.
1985.84-1503,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.888,2402.888,That's what I thought you were saying.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2402.888,2405.173,"No, not from their own members, only from their non-members."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.173,2441.096,"Mr. Vieira, supposing they went to the state legislature in springfield and said, we have an expense... a free rider problem, we have an expense of representing non-members as well as members, and we can demonstrate to the legislature that substantially all of the dues is required for this duty, an amount roughly equal to that, and the legislature, say it made an express finding... they didn't here... that we think generally speaking the dues is a fair summary of what the costs are involved, so we'll make an initial payment of dues, and that's just your contribution, subject to some right to recoup if it's misspent in some way."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2445.833,2448.368,Because I think that brings you into Justice O'Connor's problem.
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.653,2461.192,"Well, now you go back to the First Amendment, and they say, yes, that's exactly right, and we'll hold the money in escrow until we resolve the First Amendment issues."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2470.548,2471.598,"--Who's the ""they"", Your Honor?"
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.598,2477.436,"The union, the union agreed with your clients that they would do it, and then they would refund the parts that--"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2477.436,2479.988,"Well, I'm not sure what the statute is that you're proposing."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.923,2481.856,--The statute's already been passed.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2482.773,2492.295,"--The statute says that the employer and the union can agree to an agency fee, the outer limit of which will be the dues."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.664,2500.985,But doesn't that represent a legislative finding that substantially all of the dues probably are required for this purpose?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2500.985,2510.442,"--No, I think it represents a legislative finding that it would be rather ridiculous for the union to claim that it was spending more money on non-members than it was spending on members, in the extreme case."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.442,2524.583,"Well, supposing they had preceded the statute with a legislative finding at the committee hearings that said, we find, based on testimony before the legislature, that most of the dues... that dues fairly represents an approximation of what's needed for this purpose."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2524.583,2525.618,100 percent of the dues?
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.135,2528.57,"Yes, or 95 percent."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2530.903,2531.522,"Every union, every year?"
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.522,2532.822,Yes.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2532.822,2534.088,"Well, I'd say that would be non-rational."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.426,2559.839,"Well, supposing after five or six years of the sort of hearings that you propose, in each of which it has come out that, in one year it was 89, the other year it was 91, the next year it was 90, so that you have a five or six-year experience that shows you're within a range of 90 percent, varying by only one or two percent, then could the legislature enact the sort of statute that Justice Stevens says?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2559.839,2566.426,"Well, it could, and I think that that statute would still be subject to judicial challenge on the facts."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.426,2568.711,"Well, what sort of challenge?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2572.563,2574.949,"Well, in the particular year, for instance."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.416,2604.134,--And why couldn't the legislature make the same judgment as the agency did?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2604.134,2606.986,"Well, I don't know how a legislature can make a judgment about the future."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.188,2618.961,"No, but they can make the judgment that there's no reason that we think the future will be any different than the past, so there'll be at least a presumption that the same amount will obtain."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2618.961,2619.511,All right.
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.663,2626.484,"Well, a presumption which would entitle the union to deduct that amount of dues."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2626.484,2628.05,"And put it where, in escrow?"
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.05,2628.8,Put it in escrow.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2628.8,2629.352,All right.
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.47,2636.422,I thought we just were discussing--
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2636.422,2637.205,"No, no."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.688,2774.328,"--Well, the odds are, though, that the amount the union wants to collect, well, almost all of it or at least a majority of it they will be entitled to in the long run."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2774.328,2776.745,"Oh, even they question that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.778,2803.063,"Well, let's assume that that would be the case."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2803.063,2803.346,Okay.
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.346,2811.833,"Let's assume that there's a perfectly legitimate basis for saying that 75 percent, 80, 90 percent of it's going to end up in the union's hands."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2811.833,2812.116,Okay.
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.116,2817.904,"All I'm suggesting is that the burden on the individual employee is not very substantial, either."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2817.904,2820.372,"Well, in this particular case the burden on the individual--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.372,2823.658,He's going to have to pay 75 cents out of every dollar anyway.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2823.658,2832.865,"--Your Honor, in this particular case the burden on the employee to determine for himself whether or not these fees are accurate is wholly disproportionate to the amount of money."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.647,2859.73,May I ask this question--
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2891.468,2895.07,The money having been collected before the determination was made?
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.07,2901.724,"It would be in escrow until whatever it would take to complete the audit, and then they divide it up, whatever the auditor said."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2905.609,2907.794,"Your Honor, at this stage I'm not interested in litigating."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.066,2924.654,"--Well, assume for the moment that they did present to the legislature a fairly strong showing that a substantial percentage of the money would be used for collective bargaining."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2944.483,2953.406,"Assuming that the legislature makes that finding, based on its determination of the need for this collection and escrowing of the moneys, I guess we'd have to live with it."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.406,2959.393,"Well, you would concede that the auditor could do it just by himself, wouldn't you?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2966.047,2970.515,"Well, Your Honor, we have the great difficulty here that, as the union itself admits--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.515,2972.783,Take Justice Stevens' example.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2980.056,2982.856,"--Well, let's not say witnesses."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.541,3030.339,"Well, let's suppose that the union said, look, we're going to have a procedure here where we're going to end up with an arbitrator, an independent arbitrator, as to how much the employee should pay, and pending that decision he doesn't have to pay anything."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3033.724,3036.06,And that figure they bring to the board.
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.512,3046.666,"Well, I know, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit doesn't seem to accept that system."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3046.666,3048.951,"No, Your Honor, I think--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.951,3050.884,Because it's under the control of the testimony.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3050.884,3052.403,"--Well now, wait a minute."
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.079,3070.03,I would think the due process employee of the Court of Appeals--
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3070.03,3070.53,--Excuse me?
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.53,3075.732,--The due process theory of the Court of Appeals would apply whether the money is collected before or after.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3075.732,3079.886,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because when the union comes--"
1985.84-1503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.886,3080.902,"Well, that's all right."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3086.304,3091.125,"--Well, it's not directed towards this question."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.894,3258.362,"Mr. Vieira, you use the term ""irrational""."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3270.301,3272.82,"But it's not necessarily collective bargaining they're paying for, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.82,3278.474,"Well, presumably a significant part of it must be, because isn't that the principal function that a union performs for its membership?"
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3278.474,3280.509,I have no idea what the principal function this union performs.
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.509,3281.992,Don't you have any idea what they do?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3286.246,3287.53,"Well, for instance, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1503,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.53,3289.463,They do represent the teachers of Chicago.
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3289.463,3289.696,--Sure.
1985.84-1503,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3307.492,3309.776,What proportion of it goes to the national?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3314.097,3316.847,"Yes, it is, but it escapes me now."
1985.84-1503,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3316.847,3318.049,It's in the record?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3318.049,3320.001,"A little more than one-third, I believe."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.524,3357.757,Could it be a school official?
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3357.757,3364.78,"Well, I suppose abstractly it could be, Your Honor."
1985.84-1503,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3374.902,3385.794,"Well, I would think the school board which bargains with the union might have as good at least a way of getting knowledge as any other governmental agency."
1985.84-1503,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3385.794,3386.394,That's right.
