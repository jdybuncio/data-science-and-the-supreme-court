1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.123,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-138, Jenifer Troxel v. Tommie Granville."
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,10.428,14.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-138,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.421,78.409,"Mr. Olson, it's not clear to me just what the Washington court included in the word harm."
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,93.441,97.055,The term harm is fuzzy.
1999.99-138,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.448,116.558,"It surely must mean more than physical harm, but what other things fall within it, do you think?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,116.558,118.652,--Harm to the child.
1999.99-138,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.225,140.034,"Can you argue that best interest of the child like, not being... that the child is harmed if his best interests are not being served, so that it's just really the flip side?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,140.034,158.735,"Well, we believe that the rule of the Washington supreme court requires a greater harm, a more specific showing, although that term is fuzzy, as Justice O'Connor points out, but in the best interests of the child standard, there is harm considered to the child whether visitation is ordered or not ordered."
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.735,163.729,I always considered the supreme court of Washington agreed with what you just said.
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,187.441,190.23,That harm and the best interests--
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.23,190.669,That... yes.
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,190.669,191.54,--standard were exclusive?
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.54,196.091,That the best interests standard would cover a much broader spectrum than the harm standard.
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,196.091,219.206,"If I understand the question correctly, our concern is that the focus of the best interests of the harm standard would over emphasize that and create a hurdle that would be greater, or higher, or more difficult to prove and would, particularly in the case that is before this Court, would effectively bar visitation for the Troxels--"
1999.99-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.206,220.673,"But Mr. Olson, isn't that some--"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,220.673,221.272,--when it's very slight.
1999.99-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.272,226.92,"--Mr. Olson, isn't that something for the Washington supreme court to spell out case by case?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,237.953,257.692,"And that is why the theory that we advance to the Court is that the magnitude of the intrusion be balanced against the constitutionally required justification, and in this case we believe that best interests of the child is sufficient for the order, because the intrusion in our case is slight."
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.952,272.501,"But you have to show, don't you, that at least this visitation order is constitutionally permissible?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,317.146,324.763,"I'm not certain of the question to me, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.895,365.298,"But you do have a line of cases not directly on point, but that cut the other way, I think."
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,374.279,375.197,Yes.
1999.99-138,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.197,382.226,"Does this mean that next a great aunt can come in and say, well, you know, I want to take her to the movies every Friday?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,382.226,400.522,"Well, the line of cases held that any parental decision is not above government regulation, but a parental decision would be subject... I'm sorry."
1999.99-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.883,415.869,But also health and safety.
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,427.814,430.637,That is true.
1999.99-138,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.637,434.833,And you say the State can regulate just whenever it's in the best interests of the child.
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,440.377,442.867,"Well, the magnitude of the intrusion would be balanced against the--"
1999.99-138,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.867,444.284,"Oh, it's very little intrusion."
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,460.567,461.575,"--Well, our--"
1999.99-138,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.904,489.541,"But do you really think that the State can have a statute as broad as this that says, any person at any time can march in and ask a court in the best interests of the child to order some kind of visitation?"
1999.99-138,0,36435,mark_d_olson,,505.88,519.934,"--Regarding the expense, Your Honor, there are two statutes in Washington that allow the court to award attorneys' fees on the basis of need and ability to pay, and that if there is any economic imbalance the court can address that."
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1689.471,1690.442,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-138,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.442,1698.41,Whether an order of one weekend a month on the facts of this case violates the Federal Constitution.
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1698.41,1704.722,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I will do so immediately."
1999.99-138,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.356,1742.197,"Did you say address, or dress?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1742.197,1742.695,--Address.
1999.99-138,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.695,1743.309,Address.
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1743.309,1744.128,Address.
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.026,1747.53,"You mean the name, the use of the name?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1747.53,1749.321,"--Yes, that's true."
1999.99-138,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.321,1751.382,"And a week in the summer, was it?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1751.382,1753.117,"There was a week in the summer, also."
1999.99-138,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.073,1792.767,"When you say this court, you mean the supreme court of Washington?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1792.767,1793.026,No.
1999.99-138,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.339,1795.247,This Court.
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1795.247,1812.126,"--This Supreme Court, in Yoder, and in Santosky both the majority opinion and Justice Rehnquist's opinion in dissent talk about the fact that the State will step in when harm to the child is being threatened."
1999.99-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.124,1818.556,Suppose the divorce--
1999.99-138,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.556,1824.213,--Under that standard there would be no relief for a grandparent even if the visitation order was 20 minutes every 6 months.
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1824.213,1825.319,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1826.322,1837.668,"Now, there are a number of statutes around the country in different States that specifically address the right of grandparents to seek visitation orders, are there not?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1837.668,1838.511,"--Yes, there are."
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.511,1840.656,How many States have that kind of legislation?
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1840.656,1843.809,"I believe it's 38, but I'm not exactly sure on the count."
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.809,1847.282,"So apparently, in your view, all of those are unconstitutional?"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1847.282,1847.796,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.796,1848.45,Out.
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1849.228,1850.126,No.
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.126,1850.663,Why?
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1850.663,1861.63,"Because first of all there may be circumstances under which a grandparent visitation statute could be enacted, and in many of those States--"
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.63,1863.157,"Well, we have 38 of them."
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1868.436,1869.144,--No.
1999.99-138,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.144,1876.147,"If they speak in terms of the right of a grandparent to seek visitation based on best interest, in any event."
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1876.147,1891.993,"If they rely on a strict best interest standard, without creating a burden of proof and a presumption that the parent is, in fact, acting in a child's best interests, yes, I do believe those statutes unconstitutionally impair a parent's right to make decisions--"
1999.99-138,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.993,1892.802,"Yes, but what if--"
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1892.802,1893.49,--about their child.
1999.99-138,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.49,1896.723,--they acknowledge those presumptions but do not have a requirement of showing harm?
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1896.723,1898.679,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1999.99-138,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.086,1906.099,What if those statutes acknowledge all those presumptions and say there's a presumption that the parents are the final say on what goes on--
1999.99-138,1,20087,catherine_w_smith,,1906.099,1906.661,Uh huh.
1999.99-138,2,36435,mark_d_olson,,3470.181,3474.656,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3493.677,3496.541,"But, of course, these children have a father now."
1999.99-138,2,36435,mark_d_olson,,3499.413,3506.947,"--It's a step parent adoption, and 28 States permit visitation in stepparents adoption cases."
1999.99-138,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3520.932,3524.035,--They didn't say anything one way or the other about the standard they were applying.
1999.99-138,2,36435,mark_d_olson,,3524.035,3525.046,--It was not discussed.
1999.99-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3581.1,3596.321,"I just want to go back to earlier, raising of the... are you suggesting that the grandparents accede to the rights that the dead father would have had, even though we're dealing with an adoptive parent, not a step parent?"
1999.99-138,2,36435,mark_d_olson,,3596.321,3606.075,"--The problem with kinship, I believe, is that we can't ignore that the children had another parent, and that we want to respect the rights of that parent."
1999.99-138,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3606.075,3607.437,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
1999.99-138,2,36435,mark_d_olson,,3607.437,3607.742,Thank you.
1999.99-138,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.742,3608.41,The case is submitted.
