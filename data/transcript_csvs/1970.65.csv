1970.65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.865,"We?ll hear arguments in Number 65, Donaldson against the United States."
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,42.94,44.656,Thank you.
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.163,438.689,"What if he -- what if it had a, would you be here, would you still be wanting -- I suppose you would still be asserting that you would have a right (Inaudible)?"
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,438.689,439.291,Yes Your Honor.
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.516,460.017,"Well, why do you urging here, (Inaudible) intervention point or that the -- or that if you are in then you would've had a defense?"
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,460.017,466.981,"Your Honor, the way this case came up, we had filed our petition for a certiorari on the intervention question."
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.562,505.755,"Was your position that if he -- if you're right, if we think you're right on intervention, and hold your right on intervention, we should remand without reaching the other -- any other question or not?"
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,505.755,511.633,"Your Honor, I would hope that you would reach the second question in our case."
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.39,519.384,On whether the administrative summonses can be used when there's a criminal prosecution in the background?
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,519.384,520.534,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.063,720.497,"(Voice Overlap) Is it your suggestion that if United States is investigating a criminal case and it goes to some third parties who had some documents that belonged to them, but the documents are irrelevant to their investigation that have -- they shouldn?t be able to take those that -- those third party should not be permitted to voluntarily to hand over those documents to the United States unless you have some opportunity to litigate about it?"
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,720.497,726.223,"No, Your Honor, we would have no objection to a third party voluntarily turning the papers over."
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.295,733.399,"In this case, if the third parties had simply said, if you want these papers, we?ll give them to you."
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,739.886,750.771,"Well, Your Honor, the way the request is made in Internal Revenue Service investigation is that the agent will make an oral request under Section 7602."
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.304,755.973,So you're really making a purely statutory argument --
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,755.973,756.353,Yes Your Honor.
1970.65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.353,758.392,-- without any constitutional overtones at all?
1970.65,0,39844,robert_e_meldman,,758.392,762.36,"No, Your Honor, I don?t believe there are any constitutional claims here."
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1517.779,1521.835,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.215,1723.636,"Mr. Wallace, are you suggesting that if the material is material which could be secured by a subpoena duces tecum in a tax fraud case or by other discovery processes, does that automatically mean its available under an administrative subpoena or summonses?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1723.636,1744.168,"Well, there is an issue if indeed there are parties who have raised it here that the -- the first issue is whether there's any right and the petitioner intervene to raise this -- the 7602 issue. That that is the statutory issue under 7602 that I believe you would have posed."
1970.65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1744.168,1750.917,But I thought you?ve started out by saying that intervention is not the real issue here that lurking under this issue is --
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1750.917,1760.595,It?s really a question of whether ? and this is in effect a form of his trying to enjoin the use of the summonses here.
1970.65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.27,1800.373,"I don?t know what his -- what your friend?s position would be on it, but he might answer the question I put to you by saying that even if, even if this would be available upon a subpoena served after they were in trial or just before a trial in a tax case, that doesn?t mean that its available for the investigation on preparation of the tax case against him."
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1801.292,1833.932,"Well, that is the contention that he is trying to make here, that it is not available in the investigatory stage and we answered that both in our brief and I propose answer it in the argument, but I think first, there is this preliminary question whether he has any right to raise it at all at this stage of the proceedings in his effort to enjoin pro tanto the investigation by preventing this particular summonses from being enforced."
1970.65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.932,1846.799,"Well of course as a practical matter, if he can?t raise it now, raising it in any other occasion as somewhat academic, isn?t it, after the cat is on the bag?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1846.799,1855.134,"Well, there is the question of whether the fruits can be introduced against him if and when a civil or criminal proceeding is ever brought against him."
1970.65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.119,1864.513,Well --
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1864.513,1870.239,What is the issue to be decided in the hearing?
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1873.195,1875.475,He has thought a hearing --
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1875.475,1876.873,I?m not talking about in the court.
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1888.123,1888.338,Oh!
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1890.411,1890.949,Yes.
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1890.949,1893.74,Yes.
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1921.067,1939.393,"Of course if it is a grand jury, he couldn?t hope to intervene but I -- what is the authority of the commissioner to hold a secret hearing which involves another man?s faith and decline to let him om, that is logical?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1939.393,1944.879,"Well, the authority is in Section 7602, if there's a question of statutory authority."
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.205,1963.184,"Yes, but here, because they issued a summon and have a secret hearing, do they?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1963.184,1963.432,Yes.
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1970.947,1980.082,"I know, but did you give (Voice Overlap), does his complaint where he wants to intervene so that he is an object of investigation and that secret hearing?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1980.082,1981.065,Oh!
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1992.472,1995.279,And he asked to intervene?
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1995.279,2000.221,He asked to intervene but in a judicial proceeding that he has brought in effect.
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2000.221,2002.409,Is this a judicial proceeding?
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2002.409,2004.462,"Well, he has brought a judicial proceeding."
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2004.462,2005.494,"Well, in his judicial --"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2005.494,2009.167,He hasn?t -- he never asked to intervene in an administrative proceeding.
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2012.261,2014.77,"Well, that -- not to (Voice Overlap) with the proceeding, isn?t it?"
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2014.77,2017.657,He didn?t asked to be present to question the witness.
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.579,2027.637,He didn?t ask to be permitted to be there?
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2027.637,2029.454,"No, he didn?t."
1970.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2042.191,2043.598,On what ground?
1970.65,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2043.598,2063.226,"On the ground that its unauthorized for the Internal Revenue Service to inquire about someone?s income, if the inquiry may lead to criminal proceedings later on if they find out that he is fraudulently understated his tax."
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3609.804,3613.097,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3779.322,3784.062,"Well, are you conceding that a grand jury could get this information without any difficulty?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3784.062,3785.27,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3787.892,3812.306,"Are you then suggesting as part of your total argument that if -- that Congress has no power to get it in this way that that leaves the enforcement aspect to calling people before grand juries, that?s what -- that?s where it would leave them, would it not?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3812.306,3814.066,I don?t believe so Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3826.218,3828.074,(Voice Overlap) may I ask you one question?
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3828.074,3828.29,Yes.
1970.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3828.29,3832.522,"Before whom did you ask to intervene, before what agency?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3832.522,3835.805,"Mr. Justice Black, it is not in the record that came up here."
1970.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3861.624,3873.497,"Well, do you concede that you were not seeking some kind of an order to intervene before the hearing officer here in order to present your views before him?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3873.497,3881.063,"Well, Your Honor, we were objecting to the summonses and be it before the hearing officer or otherwise."
1970.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.252,3903.601,But your issue is that he -- they aren't entitled to get the records at all by this mode?
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3903.601,3904.636,By this mode?
1970.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3906.283,3912.853,"And it wouldn?t satisfy you if the ruling was that, yes, they can get them, but you can be present after they get them?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3912.853,3916.081,I think this would be a great step forward Mr. Justice White.
1970.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3916.081,3918.412,"And it wouldn't satisfy you, that isn?t your argument here."
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3918.412,3919.075,"No, it isn?t."
1970.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3919.075,3919.699,Yes.
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3919.699,3922.66,I may tell you that.
1970.65,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3922.66,3932.502,"In effect, does the result of your position if it is upheld that 7602 is nullified for all practical purposes?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3932.502,3933.516,"No, I don?t believe so."
1970.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3950.072,3976.916,"But sometimes really we know as a practical matter, that if the agent went by this process under 7602 and found out that the deductions that a taxpayer has been claiming for interest for a long period past, as a regular practice had never been in fact paid, that civil inquiry would lead very likely to a criminal prosecution, would it not?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,3976.916,3982.607,"That?s true Mr. Chief Justice, however, we have not even objected to the summonses in that case."
1970.65,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4005.33,4010.702,"Well, if that is so, then your position does mean that 7602 is nullified?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,4010.702,4014.654,"If they continue to only make this -- use of the summonses, yes it would."
1970.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4014.654,4032.3,"Well, what -- the way to enforce your position I suppose would be to say that whenever a 7602 summonses is issued and responded to the taxpayer then being investigated cannot be criminally prosecuted, that would be the sanction to enforce your position, would it not?"
1970.65,2,39844,robert_e_meldman,,4032.3,4038.788,"Yes Your Honor and there have been cases cited in the brief, I believe Hinsky (ph) versus Clark which did just that."
1970.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4043.279,4046.137,"Right, alright."
1970.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4046.137,4046.532,Thank you.
1970.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4046.532,4047.888,Thank you.
1970.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4047.888,4052.67,The case is submitted.
