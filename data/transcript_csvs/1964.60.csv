1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.909,"Number 60, Nick Jankovich and Paul Jankovich, co-partners doing business as Calumet Aviation Company, Petitioners versus Indiana Toll Road Commission."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,18.045,19.987,May it please the Court.
1964.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.291,475.752,What's the function of the transition zone?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,475.752,479.662,The transition zone is what its name says.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,509.136,519.11,"Well then for all practical purposes, there are some portions of the transition zone upon which no buildings can be built, is that right?"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,519.11,524.702,Some portion of the area approach zone and transition zone start with zero.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,567.925,570.822,Why do you start at the farthest side of the river?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,570.822,571.672,Of the river?
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,571.672,572.236,Yes.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,572.236,577.086,I am -- this is something the record does not disclose.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,586.57,588.355,Boundary line of what?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,588.355,590.833,Separating the airport property.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,591.474,592.627,"Yes, I see."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,592.627,593.965,This is the airport property.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,593.965,594.177,Oh yes.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,594.177,603.715,"This is the other property on the other side, the river separated and I'm assuming that the people who do this ordinance said there wasn't going to be anybody building structures on the riverbed."
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,610.089,611.405,And that's 22 and one half feet?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,611.405,615.256,"That's 22 and one half feet, right."
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1044.413,1050.67,In effect Mr. Dunau --
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1050.67,1072.664,"Yes sir but more particularly or another reason that I want to stress is, is that the only on the merits, the only question before this court is the validity of this ordinance on its face and not as respondent would try to change this case in this Court into a question whether it was invalid by virtue of its specific application in the particular circumstances of this case."
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1101.766,1102.216,Mr. Dunau.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1102.216,1102.238,Yes sir.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1102.238,1112.288,"I was wondering if -- if the particular effects of this case weren't an issue, how they contribute $160,000 on damages?"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1112.288,1116.198,Because what was an issue is whether the ordinance was violated.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1144.874,1148.253,Is the airport in use or wasn't at that time of the trial?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1148.253,1150.478,It was and still is in use.
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.071,1271.957,Once you relied on its own statute when its own decision is clear.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1271.957,1273.734,It's cited there your honor.
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.734,1275.117,First?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1275.117,1279.022,I don't know what significance it is whether one is cited first or another second.
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.812,1287.19,Is there significance if they cited them at all?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1287.19,1290.414,"If I may, Your Honor I would -- I intend to come back to that."
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1913.101,1913.975,Can I ask if the government --
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1913.975,1914.898,Yes sir.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1914.898,1917.351,-- prescribed the length of these runways.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1917.351,1917.805,Yes sir.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1931.097,1931.845,Yes.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1931.845,1934.467,I don't know that they prescribed the runway itself.
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1939.747,1952.843,"What I was saying though, the airport for a large city would require one kind of transportation or probably for a smaller city, it would require another."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1958.414,1960.364,That is entirely correct and I --
1964.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1960.364,1961.719,Who determines that?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1961.719,1973.041,I think the kind of an airport you build is the product of the cooperation above this -- the local government and the Federal Aviation Agency.
1964.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.056,2295.607,You had to remove the building with -- make the airport -- the runway safely in taking off and landing.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2297.367,2298.861,"If you have -- well, yes sir."
1964.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2307.698,2315.393,"By eliminating by zoning, the prospect of erecting that size of the building wouldn't be?"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2315.393,2319.596,That is correct because this is the same as all zoning everywhere.
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2673.812,2678.353,Are you going to say totally the fact the state law out there?
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2678.353,2679.326,I've got it.
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.742,2781.159,"Well, it could have been, you raised the state constitutional question though in your --"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2781.159,2782.002,We didn't raise anything.
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2783.548,2784.403,I beg your pardon.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2785.594,2787.59,"Somebody raised it, yes sir."
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.59,2795.355,"As far as we know, the Indiana Court has said that the federal rule that we adopt is a state rule."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2797.157,2813.141,"Whatever the court below said, this much is clear that it's decision cannot be an adequate state ground because its decision stands, it is in conflict with the Federal Airport Act, whether it took that decision as an adoption of federal law or it took it as an independent interpretation of state law --"
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2813.141,2814.513,"Well, that's something else."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2814.513,2821.677,"Whichever way it took, it cannot be an adequate state ground and this is what I'm addressing myself to now because it's in conflict with the Federal Airport Act."
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2821.677,2825.007,"We had a case very similar to this, Minnesota Tea case."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2825.007,2826.221,Yes sir.
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.221,2833.485,"And we couldn't tell whether this state was on the federal ground or on the state's constitutional ground, we remanded it."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2835.781,2841.049,"I understand that on the remand in that case, the state court held that it had been deciding it on a state ground."
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.049,2843.112,Yes.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2843.112,2858.171,"The first point, I want to make however is that there is no point to a remand in this case to get clarification as to whether it's a state ground or a federal ground because if it's a state ground, it cannot stand as an adequate state ground because of conflict with the Federal Airport Act."
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2877.023,2892.466,(Inaudible) preempted the area of state law with respect to whatever the states may consider to be not their zoning and is not their zoning.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2892.466,2900.14,"Well, I don't want to use the word preemption because for me, that has a more pervasive connotation on the word conflict."
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2934.908,2948.331,"As a matter of fact, that means that to build an airport in interstate and the public municipality in the states must bear every property in the zone --"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2948.331,2948.657,"No, sir."
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3009.367,3010.541,That's quite right.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3018.642,3026.798,What is their constitution and fundamental law gets back to what is the judicial notion of what is inherent in property ownership.
1964.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3026.798,3031.771,So we have to accept the investigation of the Indiana Supreme Court and to let that constitution --
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3031.771,3060.446,Yes sir and their constitution says that it's inherently incompatible with property ownership to have airport zoning and that premise of the state constitution is in conflict with the Federal Airport Act which proceeds precisely on the other premise that it is entirely compatible with property ownership to have airport zoning that is the precise point of collision between the interpretation of the state constitution and the Federal Airport Act.
1964.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3060.446,3065.545,"Of course, that part of the Federal Airport Act might violate the Federal Constitution too."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3065.545,3067.552,"And this is why, we are here on the merits."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.736,3117.728,"The Indiana Court may have said airport zoning is unconstitutional under its state law but it didn't say that having properly constructed airports, there was anything wrong with having properly constructed airport, all they said was -- you shouldn't -- what they meant by saying zoning is unconstitutional, is it, you shouldn't zone without paying."
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3117.728,3119.53,"Well, but that is precisely the point."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.09,3132.845,"If you have to pay, you're in the teeth of the Federal Airport Act?"
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3132.845,3147.77,"Yes because the Federal Airport Act proceeds on the premise that with respect to a significant part of the protection which you are going to give to aerial approaches, you do not have to pay, you can zone."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.345,3169.753,But all that means is that the federal money won't go into it.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3169.753,3177.065,"But if the federal money doesn't go into it, then the Federal Airport Act and the plan of having a national airport plan goes down the drain."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.065,3179.933,Or I think they just don't have airports in the state then.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3179.933,3180.224,Why?
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.224,3180.335,That's (Voice Overlap)
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3180.335,3197.212,"If they don't have airports in the state, you are doing exactly what is not intended under the Federal Airport Act because the premise of the Federal Airport Act is that you will have airports in Indiana, in Alaska, in California, in Georgia, in every place in the 50 states of the United States."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.014,3203.06,They don't require any state to have an airport.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3203.06,3203.819,I beg your pardon.
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.819,3205.836,They don't require any state to have an airport.
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3205.836,3222.938,"The National Airport Plan is predicated on the assumption that people want airports, that they need federal money to get airports and that this is the way you're going to accomplish the federal purpose by conditioning financial aid on compliance with federal standards."
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.938,3234.428,(Inaudible) federal government and build it by paying -- by paying after these rights --
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3234.428,3237.511,They could do that Your Honor but when we talk that way --
1964.60,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.511,3238.744,(Inaudible)
1964.60,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3238.744,3243.179,"No sir because when we talk that way, we're talking fictitiously."
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3374.262,3375.314,May it please the Court.
1964.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3458.989,3460.186,Excuse me Mr. Cox.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3489.132,3490.454,That is one of his arguments.
1964.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.098,3492.274,What about that one.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3492.274,3503.365,"Well, it the Solicitor General in the footnote on page 2 of his brief dismissed that argument summarily as having no basis in the law but I will talk a little bit about it."
1964.60,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3613.38,3614.841,It doesn't have to be by zoning?
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3614.841,3616.986,It doesn't have to be by zoning.
1964.60,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3666.379,3669.712,You said there was second proposition you thought (Voice Overlap)
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3669.712,3717.265,"Well I understand him to argue that before you ever get to the Supremacy Clause argument, that this is not an independent ground of decision because the court in Indiana cited some decisions of this Court as authorities and it did -- I was about to point out that the fact it decided the question under the Federal Constitution as well as the question under the state constitution does not in itself provide a basis for the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction because this Court is held many times if there are two grounds one, a state ground and one of federal ground and the state ground is sufficient to sustain the position below, this Court will not take jurisdiction that cases --"
1964.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3717.265,3724.11,But what if the view of the state constitution is somewhat influenced by federal consideration.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3724.11,3740.078,I think that makes no difference Mr. Justice White because this Court has said -- it said plainly in the National Tea case that the fact that the state court uses the decisions of this Court as persuasive authorities doesn't give the Court jurisdiction.
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3858.975,3865.112,(Inaudible)
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3865.112,3865.7,That's right.
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3866.303,3881.518,(Inaudible).
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,3881.518,3893.514,Quite true and my position is that the citing is treating them as persuasive authorities which is what this Court said that it could be done without raising a federal question.
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4025.179,4028.77,This toll road was privately owned or just the state.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4028.77,4032.678,It's owned by the Indiana Toll Road Commission.
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4032.678,4034.328,(Inaudible)
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4034.328,4042.374,There is a creature of the legislature of Indiana.
1964.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4042.374,4043.608,It's a public authority.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4043.608,4046.754,"Public authority, yes, quite so Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4046.754,4051.822,(Inaudible)
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4051.822,4091.756,"Well this is a very odd case Mr. Justice Goldberg when you say that, I have to say it to you that this toll road was built where it is and if the elevation is built in relation to the airport, by my client under an agreement with the City of Gary that if Gary agrees that this toll road could be built right where it is and that the elevation is in relation to the highway and my client paid the city and connection with that settlement for that another covenants and agreements and made in -- obligated itself to pay a $1,500,000."
1964.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4091.756,4093.771,This is after Gary that leads to the airport.
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4093.771,4095.516,"So after Gary, it leads to the airport."
1964.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4108.417,4110.292,Maybe the appellants should be suing Gary?
1964.60,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4110.292,4135.808,"I think they should be suing Gary, they should not be suing in my opinion my clients but -- and then I ask the Court to bear in mind two particular -- I'm not going to try to take your time to deal with all these points but in connection with this matter of variance, and your duty to exhaust your administrative remedies, I asked the Court to remember that my client did not come into Court attacking this ordinance."
1964.60,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,4511.408,4513.223,May it please the Court.
1964.60,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4707.085,4712.645,Thank you gentlemen.
