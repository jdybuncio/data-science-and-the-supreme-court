2019.18-217,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.16,We'll hear argument next in Mathena versus Malvo. Mr. Heytens.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,5.16,17.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Fifteen years ago, Lee Malvo was tried, convicted, and sentenced for his role in the D.C. sniper attacks."
2019.18-217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.32,156.92,"Mr. Heytens, could we back up a little and explain to me why these sentences are not mandatory? I mean, the jury had only two choices, death or life without parole."
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,186.76,197.32,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm not aware of any Virginia judge ever reducing a juvenile life without parole sentence for a person convicted of capital murder, which was the offense that Malvo is convicted of."
2019.18-217,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,241.64,271.24,"But did the judge know he could, given that there was no history of doing it? I think that's -- that's the position of the SG in this case. But, more fundamentally, the Fourth Circuit concluded, I quote them, ""Malvo's youth and attendant circumstances were not considered by either the jury or the judge to determine whether to sentence him to life without parole or some lesser sentence."" Do you disagree with that statement?"
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,271.24,279.0,"I think it's very hard to tell, based on the record, whether they were. I think the fairest description of the record is that there is no affirmative indication one way or another."
2019.18-217,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.0,279.36,All right.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,310.96,311.6,So --
2019.18-217,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,311.6,322.12,"So that really is the nub of this case, which, given the language of Montgomery and Miller, does it make any sense to treat either of them differently?"
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,322.12,330.12,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the first thing I'd say to that is I don't think that, for Teague purposes, we can say given the language of Montgomery and Miller."
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,362.04,367.64,"General, this is -- may be Justice Sotomayor's question phrased a little bit differently."
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,405.88,411.92,"Justice Kagan, I'm sorry, I don't think that would be permissible, but I think we need to distinguish between why that's not permissible."
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,455.0,460.4,"I mean, it -- I guess what you're saying is that it would take another case to make that clear."
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,495.08,513.04,"So two responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, I do want to differentiate because I think the habeas context matters here. I agree with you that, after Miller, the right interpretation of the Eighth Amendment is that the thing you describe would violate it. But I think under this Court's Teague jurisprudence, that doesn't resolve the question of whether decision II is a new rule."
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,532.56,532.72,So --
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,532.72,534.0,-- non-mandatory.
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,534.0,538.24,-- I think I -- we're just going to posit that I disagree with that.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,538.24,538.6,Okay.
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,538.6,540.8,But suppose I didn't disagree with that.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,555.48,565.16,"And I certainly acknowledge that Montgomery says that, Justice Kagan, but I don't think that's controlling for Teague purposes and I think the Court has specifically actually confronted a case quite similar where that happened."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,611.84,612.16,Can I --
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,612.16,613.52,-- or the district court --
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,613.52,615.72,-- can I ask --
2019.18-217,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.72,651.52,"I'm sorry, we couldn't under Teague have made Miller retroactive, unless there was both a procedural and substantive rule. And so whether or not there are people who misread Miller or not, some courts did, a lot didn't, the substantive ruling of Miller was very clear, that it rendered life without -- I'm quoting it, parole, an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants -- a class of defendants because of their status."
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,689.8,703.48,"Justice Sotomayor, I certainly don't disagree that there is language to that effect in Montgomery, but I think it is important that that language you just quoted is virtually all from Montgomery and appears nowhere in Miller except for a few words that are sort of included in that very long quote."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,703.48,725.24,Suppose I try to read Miller and Montgomery together to figure out what the substantive rule is and that I conclude the substantive rule is that the state cannot impose life without parole on youth who are merely immature but can impose it on those who are incorrigible.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,733.8,734.12,Correct.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,734.12,747.16,"The procedural rule attached, you can read it in a couple different ways, so I want to get your thoughts, one is it rules out an on-the-record finding. Right? Montgomery says you don't have to make a record finding of incorrigible."
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,768.44,775.08,"Justice Kavanaugh, I think certainly in the habeas context, that satisfies the -- the -- the holdings of Miller and Montgomery."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,775.76,777.28,"The ""that"" being a discretionary sentencing issue?"
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,777.28,777.68,I'm sorry.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,778.68,788.92,And why is it -- why is something more procedurally not required? We know -- we know a record -- a finding of fact is explicitly ruled out by Montgomery and that's very important.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,794.52,797.68,"Well, I -- I think particularly because of the habeas context."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,816.36,817.36,Let me ask it this way.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,832.08,835.84,"I would say that under existing law on collateral review, yes, I would."
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,835.84,842.48,Even if you know for a fact that the sentencer did not take youth into account?
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,842.48,844.12,"Well, Justice Kagan, I guess first I would --"
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,844.12,846.52,It's a discretionary system.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,850.44,853.84,"Justice Kagan, I just want to make sure this is a hypothetical or if you're asking about the facts of this case."
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,853.84,854.72,"No, no, this is the hypothetical."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,854.72,855.0,The hypothetical.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,855.0,855.0,Okay.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,856.32,856.4,I have a follow-up --
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,856.4,857.28,-- would be different depending on --
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,857.28,859.16,-- I -- I have a follow-up hypothetical to the hypothetical.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,859.16,859.52,Okay.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,884.6,885.0,Okay.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,918.08,919.04,Yes.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,921.08,935.36,"How do we know -- and this is the tough part of the case for me, it's right on this -- how do we know in that circumstance that the sentencing judge separated the incorrigible from the -- I'm using these phrases as shorthand --"
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,935.36,935.68,Sure.
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,935.68,936.68,-- the mere -- the merely immature?
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,936.68,955.6,"I think the best way we know that is because, as our brief and the state's brief explains, in every single state that has a discretionary sentencing scheme, the sentencer is specifically instructed to consider age, and I think the court particularly in the habeas context can presume that judges follow their obligation under state law."
2019.18-217,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,955.6,965.08,Is this one of those states where the sentencer is given a list of criteria that he's supposed to consider?
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,965.08,974.4,"Yes, the Supreme Court of Virginia in Jones II specifically articulates the factors that sentencers are supposed to consider including in deciding whether to suspend a sentence, and one of those factors is age."
2019.18-217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.4,975.28,If I understand --
2019.18-217,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,975.28,979.16,It specifies in considering whether to suspend a sentence?
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,979.16,980.6,I believe it does.
2019.18-217,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,989.36,993.6,But that was not -- Jones II was many years after this sentencing took place.
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,993.6,994.88,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1006.8,1021.8,"What if we were unsure about that? Shouldn't we re -- even if you are correct on the law here, isn't there still a question of whether Virginia's regime was truly discretionary?"
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1021.8,1022.84,I don't think there --
2019.18-217,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1022.84,1024.68,Or do you think -- or do you think that's over?
2019.18-217,0,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1024.68,1026.52,"I -- I apologize, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.18-217,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1040.28,1046.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin."
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1046.28,1063.84,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Malvo is arguing that his life without parole sentences for his murders are retroactively invalid under Miller even if Virginia law allowed him to seek a lower sentence based on his age. That's wrong for two reasons."
2019.18-217,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1192.4,1192.84,And his --
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1192.84,1193.0,But --
2019.18-217,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.0,1195.24,-- his opportunity came from what?
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1195.24,1253.44,"So his opportunity came from the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court -- again, Your Honor, we're not taking a position on whether this should, in fact, be considered a mandatory or discretionary scheme under Miller. We are just assuming, along with the Fourth Circuit -- and I think, as Justice Kavanaugh's recent questioning got at, we do think this should be remanded if the Court agrees with us for some further exploration of the nature of Virginia's scheme. But assuming that this was a discretionary scheme, Jones II, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in that case, says that a defendant in Malvo's position -- and Jones was, I think, similarly situated to Malvo in this respect -- was able to seek suspension of all or part of his sentence on any ground, including youth. And if that is correct and that is -- and if that is sufficient for a scheme to be considered discretionary under Miller, then I don't think he has a claim under Miller."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1288.28,1301.0,"You -- you want us to hold that a discretionary regime satisfies Miller and Montgomery and remand for consideration of all these things, forfeiture, whether it was really discretionary?"
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1301.0,1302.08,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1310.96,1311.48,Right.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1311.48,1321.88,"-- contrary to the Virginia Supreme Court's view -- sorry, because even if, consistent with the Virginia Supreme Court's view, this is a discretionary scheme, then he would have a Miller claim."
2019.18-217,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1321.88,1335.72,"But, again -- and this is the same question that I asked Mr. Heytens -- if it's a discretionary scheme, a judge could simply say, well, I don't think that that consideration matters at all; I refuse to consider it."
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1338.84,1343.08,"No, I think our answer to that is a little bit different from General Heytens' answer."
2019.18-217,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1369.2,1369.6,Right.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1421.56,1427.04,"So, Justice Kagan, let me give you the sort of short answer to your question and then I have a slightly longer answer."
2019.18-217,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1458.2,1483.16,"No, Montgomery says Miller's holding that only the irretrievably corrupt can be sentenced to life without parole. That's what Montgomery says. And that's -- you know, in fact, it's taken language from Miller and saying that's the substantive rule that comes out of Miller, which is this distinction between those who commit crimes based on transient immaturity, blah blah blah."
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1483.16,1513.48,"So this gets at my somewhat longer answer, Justice Kagan, which is that, you know, as we acknowledge in our brief, I think it's very difficult to completely square some of the language in Montgomery with the language in Miller, which I think is very clearly focused on mandatory sentences. And to the extent that the Court has to preference some language over other language, we'd urge the Court to preference the language that adheres to the common scenario in both cases which involved only mandatory sentences."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1513.48,1514.2,Maybe I thought --
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1514.2,1514.52,The --
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1514.52,1515.12,Keep going.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1516.44,1550.04,"The other thing I would say about the particular paragraph on which we're focusing here is I think it makes more sense if you view Montgomery as really being focused on mandatory sentences, which is all anyone was thinking about in the case. And I think what Montgomery is trying to do in that paragraph is to fit Miller's holding, which, again, Montgomery recognizes in several places is limited to mandatory sentences, into the language that this Court has used to describe substantive rules. And it does so in a kind of unique way."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1582.84,1583.36,But if it is --
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1583.36,1583.76,I don't --
2019.18-217,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1583.76,1587.32,That's just to say you wish Montgomery was a different opinion.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1609.76,1623.32,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it's an especially clear rule, in part because it kind of -- if I may use the word fudges a little bit the way this Court's described substantive rules by describing it in procedural terms."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1626.84,1627.76,"Well, the object --"
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1627.76,1628.28,-- what crime the defendant --
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1628.28,1628.32,Sorry.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1630.56,1631.64,"So, Your Honor, I think --"
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1631.64,1635.6,"And that's not necessarily objective, but that is the fact that distinguishes the --"
2019.18-217,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1635.6,1638.88,Those are the people who can't -- you cannot sentence in a certain kind of way.
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1638.88,1639.36,Right.
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1639.36,1644.24,"Well, Your Honor, I think, and Justice Kavanaugh was just getting at this, it's not really an objective fact."
2019.18-217,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1647.44,1650.56,But that's the category -- that's -- I'm done.
2019.18-217,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.56,1650.8,You can --
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1650.8,1669.28,"I guess I'd just finish with the thought that Montgomery's framing of this I don't think is particularly problematic if it's limited to the only context anyone was considering in that case, mandatory sentences. But it becomes very problematic if the language is extended to invalidate all life without parole sentences under discretionary schemes."
2019.18-217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.28,1696.6,"Mr. Feigin, I would like to ask you about the government's change in position because, as I understood it, the government originally argued that juveniles -- juveniles sentenced to life without parole must be resentenced after Miller and Montgomery, whether life without parole is mandatory or imposed as a matter of discretion. That was the position that the government took, and most of the lower courts are in accord with it."
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1700.16,1702.08,"Well, a couple things, Your Honor."
2019.18-217,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.88,1751.8,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-217,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1751.8,1752.4,Thank you.
2019.18-217,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.4,1753.64,Ms. Spinelli.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1753.64,1759.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Miller and Montgomery control this case."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1894.72,1914.68,"That argument you're making -- that argument you're making is about the Virginia scheme, and we'll get to that, I think, but there's an initial question about what Miller and Montgomery mean. And you heard my question about the substantive rule being something that separates the incorrigible from the merely immature."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1938.04,1957.4,"Because the substantive rule, which I think you -- I agree with your articulation, the substantive rule requires that in order to ensure that juveniles don't receive an unconstitutionally disproportionate punishment, a court must consider the characteristics of youth and must make a determination as to whether that juvenile --"
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1957.4,1958.12,Okay.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1958.88,1959.0,Please.
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1959.0,1960.88,"-- sorry to interrupt, but this is important."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1981.96,1983.48,It does not say make a finding of fact.
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1984.52,1984.96,Okay.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1999.0,2000.8,"No, it's not."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2005.96,2006.12,Yeah.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2006.12,2016.64,Miller makes very clear that sentencers must actually consider the characteristics of youth and determine whether life without parole is a proportional sentence --
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2016.64,2016.88,So --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2016.88,2017.72,-- for the individual defendant.
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2017.72,2019.64,-- I'm going to -- I'm going to stop you again.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2072.2,2074.24,"No, it doesn't, and let me explain why."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2099.2,2100.84,I may or may not agree with that.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2126.56,2130.08,It's possible that that could be sufficient under Miller.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2142.92,2143.72,Ms. Spinelli --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2143.72,2145.0,-- sentence for that juvenile.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2145.0,2159.28,"-- what -- what I'm -- there is a line in Miller that says -- and this is the one they hang their hat on -- that Miller ""did not impose a formal fact-finding requirement,"" that Miller did not impose -- this is from Montgomery --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2159.28,2159.88,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2159.88,2173.0,"-- that Miller ""did not impose a formal fact-finding requirement, does not leave states free to sentence a child whose crimes reflect transient immaturity to life without parole."" So there's a substantive right --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2173.0,2174.04,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2174.04,2179.84,"-- if your -- if your crime was of transient immaturity, not to be sentenced."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2197.44,2198.0,Correct.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2198.0,2214.84,"So it's like now, 3553 of the federal criminal code requires a laundry list of things for judges to consider. Most judges do not tick off each one of those. Doesn't say I find this but I don't find that. I don't do this."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2227.32,2227.72,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2227.72,2274.2,"-- in that kind of system, assuming that this was a post-Jones case, not a pre-Jones case, for which there's some ambiguity, why isn't that system enough? Are you requiring a formal fact-finding? Are you saying as long as it's clear that the judge knew that he had to find incorrigibility and that was argued before him, and he didn't have to say I find it, but he sentenced the person to parole, that you assume he knows what he's doing, that in the absence of those arguments, that then you're not sure and the substantive right should trump? I'm not sure how you --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2274.2,2285.36,"So, if we were dealing with a situation in which there was a statute that mirrored the requirements that Miller set out, it would be in a completely different case. That is not what we have here."
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2286.44,2287.24,"Well, but they --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2287.24,2288.64,-- was not required to consider youth or even --
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2288.64,2298.16,But a lot of -- a lot of the state statutes -- and this is what I think is concerning some of my colleagues -- have -- have since Miller said it's discretionary now.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2298.16,2299.16,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2299.48,2307.36,Courts don't have to do mandatory life and they should consider -- they should consider -- consider age.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2307.68,2308.48,That's correct.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2308.48,2316.68,"-- I must admit that I read Jones, but I don't remember if Jones said it -- age must be considered in light of Miller."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2316.68,2317.92,It did not say that.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.92,2320.88,Or in light of Montgomery's substantive rule.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2320.88,2322.32,It did not say that.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2322.32,2324.36,All right? But that's the assumption being made.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2324.36,2325.04,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2325.56,2342.72,"What are you -- what are you asking for, all of those other systems, post-Jones, that let or tell judges to consider age but don't say in accordance with Miller and Montgomery? Don't we presume that they know the law and follow it? That those judges --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2342.72,2345.24,"Going forward, yes, I agree."
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2356.96,2361.28,It sets those out and -- and requires courts to evaluate them?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2361.28,2362.4,"Precisely, yes."
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2363.24,2368.88,"As opposed to, for example, either that doesn't set them out or that just, you know, permits courts to do whatever they want?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2368.88,2369.92,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2369.92,2370.2,Right?
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.2,2370.52,So --
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2370.52,2371.56,And there's different kinds of --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2371.56,2372.2,And here --
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2372.2,2373.52,-- non-mandatory schemes.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2373.52,2373.88,So --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2373.88,2374.84,I apologize.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2374.84,2376.24,"Well, no, I don't know which one of you I was interrupting."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2376.24,2377.32,"No, please, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.32,2384.08,"Sets them out like in 3553, is that the sentencing considerations?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2384.08,2384.52,"Well, it's --"
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2384.52,2392.68,Is that enough? Here are the things you need to consider and transient youth or incorrigibility is one of them?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2392.68,2398.96,If there is a statute that expressly sets out these factors and if the judge considers them --
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2398.96,2399.6,And -- and --
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.6,2400.16,"Well, that's the -- that's --"
2019.18-217,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2400.16,2401.48,-- requires a court to consider them.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2401.48,2407.64,"And requires the courts to consider them, then we can presume that the judge followed the law and did so."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2424.2,2426.76,Back on Justice Kagan's question for a second.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2452.8,2454.2,"Going forward, yes."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2454.2,2454.68,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2473.92,2474.32,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2493.2,2509.44,"Well, I think we have to say what Miller and Montgomery -- well, I don't know what we have to do, but we might want to say what Miller and Montgomery mean as a rule together, because that's been a lot of the focus of the briefs. So we may have to indicate what is the substantive rule and what is the procedure and then we can figure out the Virginia --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2509.44,2518.68,"Well, yes, the substantive rule is that the Eighth Amendment forbids states to impose life without parole on juveniles who are not permanently incorrigible."
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2518.68,2519.6,"Okay, counsel --"
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2519.6,2522.36,And that's the holding of -- that is the holding of Miller?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2522.36,2525.8,That is -- that is what Montgomery --
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2525.8,2539.8,"Well, can -- could Montgomery change Miller? Montgomery, in Montgomery, the issue was whether Miller was retro -- whether the -- the rule adopted in Miller was retroactive to cases on collateral --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2539.8,2540.32,Correct.
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.32,2543.44,Doesn't it have to take Miller as it stands? Can it change that?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2543.44,2547.56,It shouldn't and it didn't.
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2548.28,2548.68,Okay.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2556.64,2557.36,It says it --
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2557.36,2557.88,It says --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2557.88,2558.2,-- on page --
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2558.2,2559.72,-- exactly what it held.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2574.72,2579.4,That was the result. There is also the reasoning that was necessary to that result --
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2579.4,2580.2,So that --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2580.2,2580.44,-- which --
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2580.44,2583.4,"-- wasn't the holding -- when they said ""we hold,"" that wasn't the holding?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2583.4,2584.92,It was certainly part of the holding.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2600.48,2618.36,"Counsel, if -- if there were a requirement of a finding -- a substantive right to a finding of incorrigibility before the -- the sentence of life without parole were permissible under the Eighth Amendment, wouldn't it follow also that there's a Sixth Amendment right under Apprendi to have a jury decide that rather than a judge?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2618.36,2622.84,I don't think that necessarily would follow.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2622.84,2623.28,How?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2623.28,2624.52,I -- I think that --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2624.52,2633.52,"Any time we increase a sentence, a statutory maximum or otherwise, a sentence, we say: Jury -- this Court has said a jury has to make that finding."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2633.52,2635.04,There's a -- there's actually a split of authority --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2635.04,2637.92,"There's no indication of any of that in Montgomery or Miller, is there?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2637.92,2638.36,Agreed.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2643.2,2650.96,"Well, the Court has held several times if you increase the -- the -- the statutory permissible range of penalty, a jury has to be involved, right? I mean, that's not --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2650.96,2651.16,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2651.48,2652.64,So there's no circuit split on that.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2652.64,2668.16,"It depends on how you conceptualize it, but, you know, that's clearly not one of the issues that's before the Court in this case. And I'm not arguing, just to be clear, that there is a requirement of a specific factual finding."
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2677.2,2677.44,Right.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2707.72,2714.12,"Well, that -- that issue was not resolved in Miller or Montgomery, and I don't think it needs to be resolved today."
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2714.12,2731.68,"Isn't that -- isn't that a further strike, though, against your interpretation of Miller and Montgomery that the Court would have created a new substantive right that implicates the Sixth Amendment and not ever said so or even hinted at it or even acknowledged the question?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2731.68,2733.28,I actually don't think that's unusual.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2745.4,2745.84,This is a pretty --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2745.84,2746.2,-- happened in Atkins.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2746.2,2758.32,"-- this is a pretty big issue, though, right? I mean, you know, the -- the judge or the jury, you know, if we're creating a new substantive right, we might want to say a few words about, hey, there's an issue whether the judge should do it or the jury should do it and we'll take that up in the next case?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2758.32,2760.24,That is what happened with Atkins.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.88,2836.0,But -- but we know --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2836.0,2837.28,-- for that particular defendant.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.28,2839.88,"-- we know it doesn't require a formal finding, right?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2839.88,2842.24,That -- that -- that is correct.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2842.24,2842.92,From Montgomery?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2842.92,2849.92,It doesn't require -- it doesn't require any particular form of words. It does require a substantive result.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.92,2852.52,But -- but you said it requires a determination.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2882.8,2883.24,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2891.92,2895.8,"Well, you are, because I -- because I asked it. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2895.8,2905.96,"I'm sorry, Your Honor. I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. What I -- what I meant is, you know, that is -- that is going to be an issue no matter how the Court decides this case."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2939.08,2939.8,I don't -- I don't think Montgomery --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2939.8,2940.72,-- and that didn't even come close --
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2940.72,2943.24,-- I don't think Montgomery says decide.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2949.96,2953.4,"Well, what it -- what it says --"
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2953.4,2957.88,"In the key paragraph, it says --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2957.88,2979.64,"-- what it says is a hearing where youth and its attendant characteristics are considered as sentencing factors is necessary to separate those juveniles who may be sentenced to life without parole from those who may not. You know, it then goes on to say, no, we didn't require a specific finding of fact, you know, we are leaving it to the states to --"
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2979.64,2980.92,Doesn't even say specific.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2981.92,2983.76,"Correct, it just says finding of fact."
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3019.2,3024.36,And your argument that Virginia did not provide that is?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3024.36,3025.84,It absolutely did not provide that.
2019.18-217,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3026.28,3026.48,You know --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3026.48,3038.8,-- there was no -- so let's assume that Jones was correct and that there was an ability to request suspension. That was not even remotely clear at that -- at the time of --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3038.8,3041.44,Let's say it was hypothetically.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3042.08,3052.12,"If -- if it was clear that he could request suspension, I still don't think it would matter because a suspension hearing is not a Miller hearing."
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3055.4,3056.16,I understand that.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3056.16,3056.76,The court hadn't --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3056.76,3084.76,But let's just say hypothetically that it was available to the defendant to argue whatever he wanted with respect to his youth and attendant characteristics in any fashion that he wanted and that the judge had to consider whatever arguments were presented about youth before imposing a life sentence and that the judge could not impose that life sentence automatically. Let's say that's the state of the law in Virginia hypothetically.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3096.08,3096.44,The hearing --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3096.44,3096.92,Then what?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3096.92,3118.92,"-- that Miller requires, however, is not a -- is not only a hearing that requires that youth be considered. Youth is considered in all kinds of contexts. But there -- Miller's specific holding is that the characteristics of youth that were identified first in Roper need to be considered in order to determine whether or not life without parole --"
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3118.92,3119.52,And I'm positing --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3119.52,3120.16,-- is a proportionate sentence.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3120.16,3124.48,"-- I'm positing a hearing, counsel, in which all of that is available to the defendant to argue."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3126.04,3144.32,"I mean, it was available to him to argue in the sense that, you know, every new rule is available to the defendant to argue before the rule is announced. In fact, you know, he had no way of anticipating that -- that this new constitutional rule would be announced."
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.48,3176.88,"We're -- we're in an awkward place because of what the Virginia court did with Jones, which is sort of look at something retroactively and say this is what you could have done."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3179.08,3179.4,Yes.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3179.4,3181.32,-- whether judges understood they could have done that.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3181.32,3182.36,But let's look at what --
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3182.36,3188.24,"But let's move -- let's move forward after Jones, okay? And Jones is after Miller and Montgomery --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3188.24,3188.8,Correct.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3188.8,3199.04,"-- correct? So it's now, they're saying, judges can have complete discretion, just the way that Justice Gorsuch has posited."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3234.36,3242.6,"Well, first, Jones didn't -- did not say that courts had to consider age in light of Miller or that they had to consider age at all."
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3249.0,3249.68,"I -- oh, I --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3249.68,3250.0,Going --
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3250.0,3251.6,-- have to read Jones more carefully.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3251.6,3257.68,"-- going forward, however, and -- and going forward, Virginia is not doing anything to comply with Miller."
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3284.84,3285.88,We don't have -- did I --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3285.88,3286.88,-- in response to Miller.
2019.18-217,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.88,3289.44,-- did I mishear you? Did you say 60 states or six states?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3289.44,3295.88,Six states with 60 juvenile lifers out of 2800.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3299.6,3300.2,But let's --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3300.2,3300.52,And --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3300.52,3313.72,"If you could answer Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that would be very helpful to me as well. Let us assume that all arguments are available at -- at hearing, at the hearing, and the defendant makes some, not others."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3313.72,3314.8,I am not arguing that --
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3314.8,3315.08,Would that be --
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3315.08,3316.48,-- his right cannot be waived.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3318.36,3319.28,"Okay, but -- but --"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3319.28,3321.64,It can be waived just like any other constitutional right.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3321.64,3328.68,"Counsel, if I might. So just all arguments are available and the -- and the -- and the district judge has to consider them."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3332.52,3336.08,It -- it might very well.
2019.18-217,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3336.08,3337.04,Okay.
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3337.04,3338.08,Yeah.
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3395.84,3415.32,In what way was it necessary for the -- the youth of your client to be considered? Do you think -- you describe him as a child who committed these crimes because of transient immaturity?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3415.32,3420.36,I -- I have not described him as a child who committed these crimes because of transient immaturity.
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3420.36,3429.68,"Well, I thought that was the test that you're saying that the court has to apply, whether that -- whether it is a child who committed the crimes because of transient immaturity."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3429.68,3438.32,The question is whether the juvenile committed the crimes based on transient immaturity or permanent incorrigibility.
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3461.52,3464.76,Is not now or was not at the time?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3464.76,3467.0,"Well, I think by hypothesis --"
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3467.0,3468.52,At the time of the sentencing?
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3468.52,3472.2,"-- this is -- you know, if one is permanently incorrigible, that's a permanent quality."
2019.18-217,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3487.76,3499.52,"So, if he can demonstrate, as a result of good behavior in prison, for example, that he has been rehabilitated, then he must be released?"
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3499.52,3500.48,No.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3562.8,3564.32,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-217,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3564.32,3564.6,Thank you.
2019.18-217,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3564.6,3568.56,"General Heytens, three minutes."
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3568.56,3581.2,"So I'd just like to address three points: what Miller requires, the shifting nature of Malvo's arguments, and why this matters. So I think Miller is quite clear what it requires because it's in the very last paragraph of Miller."
2019.18-217,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3626.64,3635.48,"And how about the case they cited where counsel did raise this argument about the youth and the judge said, I have no power?"
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3635.48,3639.32,"I think that would be -- first of all, that's not this case, because there was no such objection."
2019.18-217,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3639.32,3652.4,"But -- but it does provide some evidence that -- and that plus the history that before Jones, there was no juvenile convicted of life without parole who was ever -- whose sentence was ever suspended."
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3652.4,3663.44,"But -- but I think at most, under Jones, that establishes that that individual was sentenced in violation of state law, not in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and that's not Mr. Malvo. Mr. Malvo never requested such an opportunity."
2019.18-217,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3676.96,3692.0,"The practical -- the practical reading that I would give of these cases, possibly, first case, you cannot sentence under state law that's mandatory a -- a juvenile to life without parole."
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3731.56,3732.0,"Well, Justice Breyer --"
2019.18-217,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3732.0,3733.56,-- no one ever thought about that?
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3733.56,3735.64,"Well, Justice Breyer, I -- I won't say opportunity then."
2019.18-217,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3736.56,3738.36,"No, no, you can say anything you want."
2019.18-217,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3739.72,3742.64,But you have an opportunity at your rebuttal to say it.
2019.18-217,3,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3742.64,3743.24,Thank you.
2019.18-217,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3755.76,3756.76,"Thank you, counsel."
