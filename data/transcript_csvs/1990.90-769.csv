1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.648,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-769, Renne v. Geary."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,11.442,12.972,"Rennie, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,12.972,13.162,Rennie?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,13.162,13.623,Rennie.
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.623,14.064,Very well.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,14.064,21.109,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.127,100.623,"Would you mind inserting another little item, which is to tell us how this case arises?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,108.59,124.298,"The respondents include some voters, Your Honor, and they include some individual members of local central committees... that is the local organ in California of the State party."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.105,137.959,And so how do we address the question in that light?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,153.258,154.099,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.099,156.032,And we don't have a political party here.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,156.032,157.955,"Only as amici, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.955,160.116,Yes.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,163.398,184.532,"Well, these respondents, Your Honor, seek... the way the case arises is they had... they sought to place in the San Francisco voter pamphlet endorsements either of them or endorsements by the committees of which they were a member."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.959,199.161,Some of them were candidates who were being endorsed?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,199.161,203.785,"I don't believe that's correct, Your Honor, although I can't answer that question for sure."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.785,208.177,"Well, perhaps we should address some of these questions to your opponent as to the standing of respondents."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,208.177,218.736,The way that the official parties in California become official parties is by choice.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.636,253.811,But what kind of... how did this case get started?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,264.868,265.599,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,265.599,268.261,And who... and then somebody refused?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,268.261,268.642,Yes.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.052,269.312,Who refused?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,269.312,270.964,--The San Francisco Registrar of Voters.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.964,272.435,Refused--
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,272.435,272.675,Yes.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.675,274.057,--to put them in.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,277.742,278.143,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.143,281.796,Because they wanted to get these endorsements in the pamphlets.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,281.796,292.976,"In a pamphlet that is sent to all voters in the city, and which we contend would make a nonpartisan election partisan because these endorsements would go to every voter in the City and County of San Francisco."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.976,299.978,And the grounds for refusing by the official was that the State law forbade endorsements?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,299.978,305.023,That the State law forbade endorsements in nonpartisan elections.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.023,305.711,Exactly.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,305.711,306.592,Yes.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.592,330.609,"Mr. Aftergut, could you tell me, this constitutional provision which says that no political party may endorse, support, or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office, does... would that prevent a political party from contributing money for the candidate to promote himself?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,343.996,344.687,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.687,344.857,It could not?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,348.79,349.301,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.601,434.841,What do you mean send it free of charge?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,434.841,441.096,It is sent without expense to the party with the sample ballot and the voter pamphlet that go out.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.096,441.586,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,441.586,442.868,State law provides for that.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.868,444.999,The State pays the postage.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,444.999,445.96,The State pays the postage.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.181,580.692,Prohibits partisan nomination.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,580.692,587.468,"--Excuse me, prohibits partisan nominations in all local, all city, all county, all school, all judicial elections."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,587.468,589.641,"Well, how does 6(b) operate?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,626.077,626.175,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.175,631.491,You could enjoin the distribution of a communication?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,631.491,631.931,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.722,634.773,That's the position you take?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,634.773,635.103,--Yes.
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.551,647.604,But you can suppress the speech?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,647.604,649.294,"--Well, the--"
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,649.294,650.696,The political speech.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,650.696,659.582,"--The government could bring an action to enjoin that, or an individual could bring an action to enjoin that, as happened in the Unger case."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.582,662.955,And how is it you think the First Amendment would allow that?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,662.955,674.592,"For the reasons that I am saying, Your Honor, that this is an essential part of the structure of government that California has chosen."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.115,683.6,"There are other States that have nonpartisan judicial elections, and they don't purport to prevent speech by political parties."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,683.6,692.603,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and that was the point I was trying to develop in terms of a difference that exists in California."
1990.90-769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,757.389,767.486,"Well, do you think that the State in First Amendment analysis can just offer additional benefits as a sort of quid pro quo for giving up First Amendment rights?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,767.486,777.954,Where the State has a sufficiently compelling interest and where the people of California have said this is how we wish to structure our government.
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,812.448,818.511,You describe all of the initial regulations that you'd recited as benefits.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,828.128,838.907,"Official... the answer is I believe you're correct that official parties are required, although I am not, I must say I am not certain."
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.177,844.501,Of course it's required by law that they meet at a particular time and place as designated.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,847.042,856.247,"--But the point is that the... that may be so with respect to that particular regulation, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.781,877.923,They just can't have a candidate in the primary.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,884.598,887.72,I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.72,895.654,"Well, you're telling us that the parties voluntarily accept all of these emoluments and benefits that you have described."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,912.985,921.052,"The party does not need to take advantage of these benefits, Your Honor, perhaps with the exception of the regular meetings."
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,931.282,941.337,Can the Democratic Party have primary elections and not be an official party with respect to all of the regulations that you have described?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,941.337,953.816,"--The Democratic Party can... the Democratic Party can, absolutely, get its candidate on the ballot for... I'm not sure about for a primary election, but it can definitely--"
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,953.816,955.486,"Well, that's critical, isn't it?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,955.486,966.134,"--It can get its candidate on the ballot by doing what any other group does, and that is by gathering the number of signatures that are necessary in order to get on the ballot."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.281,998.205,So you say there is a way for a political party to get on the ballot without becoming an official party?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,998.205,998.646,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.646,1001.297,And that's by getting signatures?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1001.297,1002.619,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.103,1015.429,"But getting it... they can get their candidate on the ballot, but it won't say that that candidate is a candidate of that particular party, will it?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1015.429,1019.213,"--I'm not sure of the answer to that, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.576,1029.972,"Well, anybody can get on the party... get on the ballot without a, if they get the number of signatures."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1029.972,1030.422,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.923,1036.348,"So a political party doesn't get on the ballot, somebody they want on the ballot gets on the ballot."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1040.941,1043.892,"--I'm not sure of the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.892,1048.175,"You're talking about general elections, because for a primary you have to be an official party."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1048.175,1048.756,Um-hum.
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.468,1070.882,"Well, what if you had a party... let's say it's the Surfer Party, that was just new in California."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1070.882,1071.103,Right.
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.103,1078.069,"And it had 100,000 members, and it wanted to, it did not want to go through the official party structure."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1089.225,1096.451,"It... that party, it could choose its candidate in any way that it wished."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.568,1105.668,It could have a convention?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1105.668,1106.419,--It could have a convention.
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.419,1110.984,But it couldn't go into the primary election the same day the officials parties did?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1110.984,1118.369,"Well, it could choose whatever day it wished, but it would not be... that would not be... they would not be a ballot-qualified party for running."
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.992,1130.225,But the State runs and pays for the primaries of the validated parties?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1130.225,1130.546,--That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.546,1130.936,Correct?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1133.968,1134.108,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.108,1136.071,And it lists those names on the ballot.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1136.071,1136.752,That's correct.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.752,1141.353,So that in a sense those parties become part of the governmental process of election.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1141.353,1143.193,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.193,1151.3,"It's part of the formal election system of California, that parties... part of the election is you have a party primary and then the formal election with the party names on it."
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1151.3,1152.319,And that is the point.
1990.90-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.625,1159.538,So it's accepting the benefits.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1161.949,1180.571,"--By becoming part of the State structure in the Statewide context, there is the danger of... the State has an enhanced power to regulate and to protect its other structure, that is its nonpartisan structure, from parties playing the role that they were designed not to play."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.376,1325.598,Is the State Attorney General involved in this case at all?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1325.598,1326.62,"No, he is not, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.032,1332.754,But this is a provision of the California Constitution?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1332.754,1333.906,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.906,1343.584,And he doesn't have any right or duty to be informed about when some constitutional provision is at issue?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1343.584,1351.4,"Your Honor, he does have a duty under the law to be informed, and we fulfilled that duty by notifying the Attorney General and--"
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.4,1352.82,But he never took any position in the case?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1352.82,1363.428,"--Whatever his reasons for not taking a position, whether they related to the fact that he is a partisan officer or was running for governor of a party, I simply cannot say."
1990.90-769,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.77,1366.97,Thank you.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1374.776,1375.967,Certainly.
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1375.967,1376.648,Okay.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1376.648,1385.844,"The principle basically that we're advocating here, Justice Souter, is really quite a limited one."
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1402.483,1410.15,"There's no limitation on PAC's and so on, for example, from coming out and endorsing and working for candidates?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1410.15,1414.241,I am not sure I understand what the Court means.
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.241,1420.405,Can a political action committee do the things which the party organization itself may not do?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1420.405,1427.351,"I think the answer to that question, Your Honor, would depend upon whose political action committee that it was."
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.862,1431.585,"Well, what's the... what's the standard by which you determine that?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1431.585,1443.782,"--Well, if this is, if what Your Honor is asking is could the Democratic Party form a PAC and do the same thing, the answer to that is no because that--"
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1443.782,1450.368,"Well, could I form a PAC of Democratic surfers and support a candidate?"
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1450.368,1463.848,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, because you and your colleagues are not the beneficiaries of the State-conferred advantages that are given precisely for the purpose of enhancing your voice."
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1476.675,1483.91,So you're just saying that the only PAC that cannot support is one that would be sort of an obvious or blatant alter-ego for the party itself?
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1483.91,1485.32,"I couldn't have said it better myself, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1486.682,1487.801,Okay.
1990.90-769,0,20495,dennis_aftergut,,1487.801,1513.72,"Since I see my white light and I would like to reserve some time, let me just summarize by saying that where the State-conferred advantages meet the single-party domination that exists in so many localities is where we have the danger of officials being beholden to parties at the sponsorship of the State."
1990.90-769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.103,1532.743,"Thank you, Mr. Aftergut."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1535.785,1536.606,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1550.717,1553.869,Could you begin by telling us how the case came up?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1555.722,1556.132,Okay.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1556.132,1559.695,--wanted to have something in the ballot.
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1561.747,1563.007,Here's what happened.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1580.989,1581.119,All right.
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1587.173,1587.554,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1587.554,1596.119,And the candidate wished to include a statement to the effect that he or she had been endorsed by a particular party or central committee?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1596.119,1602.032,"Basically, Your Honor, that's, that's what the dispute was about."
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1607.427,1610.76,No candidate had come forward and said include this endorsement?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1610.76,1611.78,--No.
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.383,1617.744,And no political party had come forward and said include this endorsement?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1624.259,1626.192,--And county committee members.
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1626.192,1627.321,--Did they have any right to--
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1627.321,1627.461,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1627.461,1630.764,--to demand that certain materials be included?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1630.764,1630.894,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1635.578,1636.149,Can an--
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1637.581,1649.689,"--County central committee members would... are by this measure prohibited from, as committee members, voting to have their committee make endorsements which the candidates could then include."
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.689,1656.664,I thought... so the prohibition includes county committee political parties as well as--
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1656.664,1656.804,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.804,1657.285,--State?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1657.285,1660.928,It includes State and county committees.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.01,1679.674,Was there any finding that there was an actual candidate that wanted to have this endorsement in his or her election?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1679.674,1680.135,No.
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.135,1685.788,Was there any indication that a party central committee wished to make an endorsement?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1685.788,1685.938,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.865,1697.127,But it was not a party?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1697.127,1697.628,--No.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.347,1723.294,"I see how that would give them an interest in whether the law is valid or not, but I don't see how that gave them an interest in the act that forms the subject matter of the suit."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1728.417,1728.557,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.557,1729.218,--in this mailing?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1729.218,1729.769,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.769,1731.729,Who has the right to include it?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1731.729,1742.424,"As long as reference is made to ballot measures, any registered voter in San Francisco could, if they pay the price, include something."
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.424,1744.277,"Well, this isn't a ballot measure."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1747.141,1748.6,That's right.
1990.90-769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.6,1758.869,So can any citizen come forward and demand that things be included in the pamphlet concerning a candidate?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1765.953,1778.802,"You find in the San Francisco Administrative Code... you find in the San Francisco Administrative Code, San Francisco Charter of Provisions, for candidate statements and for ballot arguments."
1990.90-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.089,1804.257,"May I ask you if the California constitutional provision had been written in a different way and simply said that the statements sent out by the candidate shall not include any party endorsements that might be made, would that be constitutional?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1804.257,1810.521,"Are you talking about in official election material, or are you talking about generally?"
1990.90-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.521,1813.854,"Official election material, which is what I gather gave rise to this controversy."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1813.854,1819.849,"Your Honor, that might be a... if it was a forum-specific regulation that might be a different problem."
1990.90-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.35,1826.684,"In other words, what I'm suggesting is perhaps even though on its face the California provision may be overly broad and unconstitutional."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1831.018,1851.891,"--Well, I'm not so sure if it is, and indeed the California court of appeal recently in a case called Clark v. Burleigh in a matter involving what judicial candidates could say, actually invalidated an election code provision that limited what judicial candidates could say in their candidate statements."
1990.90-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.861,1859.766,"But it didn't invalidate the provision prohibiting them from announcing a party endorsement in their candidate statement, did it?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1859.766,1860.137,--No.
1990.90-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.137,1862.328,Which is... well--
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1874.606,1876.028,The only reason was the State constitutional provision.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.028,1877.1,--That's the only reason he gave?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1877.1,1877.35,That's right.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.956,1885.109,And as far as we know there is no other basis?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1886.781,1888.851,They have never asserted any other basis.
1990.90-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.213,1894.866,"Well, what submission are you... was there an actual submission made?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1894.866,1896.448,--No.
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.533,1919.214,"Well, what are the merits, Mr. Smith?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1919.214,1928.929,"Your Honor, on the merits, I think it's hard to envision a more flagrant violation of the First Amendment."
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.772,1966.756,"Well, to get a little closer to home, how do you distinguish this case from Austin v. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1966.756,1967.337,How do I distinguish it?
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.337,1967.778,Yes.
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,1967.778,1968.459,Easily.
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.881,2014.781,"Well, but the Michigan statute certainly prohibited the Michigan corporation in question from expressing itself in an election, and we said it was justified because the danger of corruption and because the State had given the corporation certain benefits."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2014.781,2017.474,"--Well, I said there are two distinctions, though."
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.841,2091.745,Do you think corruption is the only evil that a State may strike at under that rubric?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2091.745,2104.265,"I think corruption is the only one that has been recognized as legitimate so far, and I think that this provision is just so all encompassing."
1990.90-769,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.835,2124.667,"It's practiced by the official party, isn't it?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2132.341,2133.152,"--Well, even if they're not--"
1990.90-769,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.152,2134.164,Are they or not?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2134.164,2138.466,"--I believe individually they could campaign, but--"
1990.90-769,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.466,2149.435,"But then, any organization besides the party can support these candidates, I suppose, in these nonpartisan elections, like the California Democratic Council?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2149.435,2151.147,"--Yeah, but that--"
1990.90-769,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.147,2153.007,"That's not an official party, but--"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2153.007,2153.398,--That's true.
1990.90-769,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.398,2162.534,"--So all organizations other than these officially recognized parties can campaign, endorse, and give money?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2162.534,2165.117,That's right.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.9,2181.589,"Do you think the State of California could prohibit the justices of the Supreme Court of California from endorsing as a group a candidate for governor, one candidate or another?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2181.589,2190.726,"I think, Your Honor, that the State might have greater ability to regulate the political activities of judges or judicial candidates than they could of the outside entities."
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.726,2191.617,Why is that?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2200.596,2209.7,Parties are part of the governmental process only insofar as they are allowed to make nominations for certain offices.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.48,2270.213,1 percent registration in what?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2272.817,2281.252,"As soon as 1 percent of the voters register say that I want... I am affiliated with this party or that party, as soon as 1 percent of the voters register a certain way, the party--"
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.252,2284.973,Do they have to honestly say whether they are affiliated with one party or another?
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2284.973,2295.5,--Under California law you have to actually... under California law you have to fill out a voter registration card that says I affiliate with this party or that party or--
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.5,2302.005,"Yeah, but I think it's... isn't it up to the party whether they want to be a primary party or not, whether they want to play the primary game and get on the ballot?"
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2302.005,2302.325,"--No, they have no choice."
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.957,2307.13,"Yeah, but they just tell their members, don't sign up."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2318.96,2319.33,--If--
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.33,2321.551,"--All right, you've got me, I'll tell the truth."
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2325.314,2335.492,--All I am telling you is that once there is 1 percent the party is on the ballot and is in the scheme.
1990.90-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.14,2395.061,We have rejected it in most contexts.
1990.90-769,1,16985,arlo_hale_smith,,2402.637,2420.428,"--Well, I believe that naturally, if you look at the cases coming after that, like Connick, it's clear that the rationale is the government has... that the government is supposed to have the same kind of control over its employees that a private employer might."
1990.90-769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.74,2438.152,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."

1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2493.17,2494.67,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.683,2509.592,"Do you think, Mr. Chao, that the Democratic Party could insist that it be able to nominate a candidate for the county board of supervisors, or whatever it is that's now nonpartisan in San Francisco?"
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2509.592,2515.906,"--Well, under the nonpartisan nomination process the answer is no."
1990.90-769,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.408,2526.332,"Well, would you... might not your argument lead to the conclusion that they have a constitutional right not to be excluded from competition for that office?"
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2526.332,2528.796,"Well, that issue is not before the Court."
1990.90-769,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.796,2530.789,"No, but I would be interested in your answer to it."
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2530.789,2535.371,"I think that would be difficult to say, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.703,2540.376,xxx offset in either way?
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2540.376,2541.715,"--Either way, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.715,2549.761,"So you don't think your argument... don't you think your argument here bears on that issue, though?"
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2549.761,2554.293,"I don't believe directly so, and I don't think we're taking it that far, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.897,2575.159,And to contribute money?
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2575.159,2578.241,"As well as contribute money, support and oppose."
1990.90-769,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.542,2588.988,Do you think that the State could prohibit the candidate from including that endorsement in the statement that's sent out to voters at public expense?
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2588.988,2590.769,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1990.90-769,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.952,2594.822,"Well, it's what gave rise to the lawsuit, though."
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2594.822,2596.934,--That is in a different portion of this lawsuit.
1990.90-769,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.327,2608.334,Your position is the Democratic or Republican Party cannot be prohibited from giving money to judicial candidates in California?
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2608.334,2612.255,"--That is correct, Your Honor, under the present... that's correct."
1990.90-769,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.209,2617.07,Are they... I take it they're not permitted to now?
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2617.07,2619.931,"--Under section 6(b) they are not permitted, that is correct."
1990.90-769,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.931,2624.704,"And this could go for retention elections, which are the only kind of elections there are, I guess?"
1990.90-769,2,18659,cedric_c_chao,,2624.704,2632.798,"That is correct, with the exception, Your Honor, that for certain of our trial courts a challenger can take on an incumbent judge--"
1990.90-769,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.798,2633.089,Okay.
