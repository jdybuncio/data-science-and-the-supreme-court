1987.86-1650,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.049,"We will hear argument now in Number 86-1650, Trans World Airlines v. Independent Federation of Flight Attendants."
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,13.581,18.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,143.504,152.531,Do I take it then that all issues have been bargained to impasse?
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,152.531,161.917,All issues that were on the table in the sense that the entire agreement was on the table.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.069,166.289,There is no more bargaining going on?
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,166.289,176.898,"The only bargaining which is going on, Mr. Justice White, is in attempt to reach an agreement."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.09,191.826,But TWA does not challenge the fact that the union is still the collective bargaining agent for its employees?
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,191.826,196.849,"--No, it does not challenge it, because under the statute, really, it has no right to challenge it."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,208.67,211.334,So what does the company have to do?
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,215.315,221.028,"As Your Honor knows, there is no Unfair Labor Practice under the Railway Labor Act."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.028,221.189,Yes.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,221.189,223.43,But the equivalent.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.219,244.363,"So once a bargaining agent is certified, that is the end of it, that is forever."
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,246.416,248.697,That is almost true.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.809,264.999,Thank you.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,264.999,285.023,"Despite the fact that there is no successor agreement, the Court below held that the union security provisions of the old agreement continue in effect because parts of the prior agreement survive, as the District Court described it, and I quote:"
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.119,387.162,"The Court thought that under the terms of the contract, and under the Railway Act, the agreement would continue except with respect to the changes that the company notified the union about?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,387.162,391.296,"Not under the terms of the contract, Justice White."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.006,466.05,"Is your first submission at least that once you gave notice of change pursuant to the contract and Labor Act, and the expiration date of the contract came about, and you exhausted all Railway Labor Act procedures and you were in the self-help phase, the entire contract is over?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,466.05,468.903,That is what the Ninth Circuit held and that is what we relied upon.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.903,476.639,And thereafter you are completely free to change any condition of employment without bargaining?
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,476.639,481.16,"I do not think that question is before the Court in this case, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.16,492.998,"If you are not free, if there are some provisions you are not free to change without bargaining, how come you are free to change the union security clause without bargaining?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,492.998,501.926,Because the union security clause is the specific subject of a specific provision of the statute which requires an agreement.
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.337,644.127,I thought you said that question was not before us here.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,651.152,655.186,"--I agree, Justice Scalia, it is not before you."
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.649,692.131,It seems to me you have to either argue you want to be like the NLRA or you do not want to be like the NLRA.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,835.318,836.767,"No, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.548,868.239,I can understand how you read it that way as support for your position in the language.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,904.193,910.647,"If Your Honor is referring, as I believe you are, to the Eight Circuit's decision--"
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.647,910.807,Correct.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,911.648,913.701,--Page 4(A).
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.701,918.784,At the bottom the page they start the discussion and they state the two issues.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,924.85,943.831,"But on Page 5, they say, we construe the terms of the duration clause of this agreement in light of the national labor policy enunciated by the Railway Labor Act, which governs airlines as well as railroads, and in light of pertinent decisions bearing on the issues."
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.522,989.512,I just don't read their Opinion that way.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,996.417,1004.893,"Justice Stevens, I think this is an important point and I would like to dwell on it for a minute or two."
1987.86-1650,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.118,1179.19,"Then you do say, Mr. Gartner, that a union security clause in a collective bargaining agreement under the RLA, whatever may be the law with respect to renewal or implied continuance of other such clauses, union security clauses are different because of the special statutory treatment in 211?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1179.19,1179.611,Yes.
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.853,1186.936,"But you still hang upon the fact that this contract terminated, right?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1186.936,1189.678,At least this provision terminated.
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.408,1191.578,All right.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1218.379,1222.379,"I tend to agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.257,1255.952,How do you get out of it in a situation where you... and I gather most of the contracts in this industry are not with a fixed termination date as this one.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1257.104,1258.014,"No, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.848,1280.289,"All right, but let's assume, whatever industry."
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1296.764,1300.614,"I do not think, Your Honor, that this Court is bound to say that."
1987.86-1650,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.449,1432.321,"Before you do, may I ask a question?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1448.583,1462.414,I would go so far as to say that you may not pay more than you have offered during the negotiations because that would be denigrating to the union.
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.873,1489.973,"What I really wanted to ask you about is if there is an obligation to maintain certain working conditions during the period of impasse, is that a statutory obligation or a contractual obligation?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1489.973,1493.074,That is a statutory obligation.
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.074,1500.668,"So it really is your view, is it not, then, that the entire contract terminated when you gave whatever the date period was after the notice?"
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1500.668,1503.871,"That is our view, yes, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.975,1512.896,I thought you had taken a different position in answer to Justice Scalia.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1512.896,1514.278,"No, I haven't taken a different position."
1987.86-1650,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.587,1530.532,I think it may relate to the theory of what happened to the balance of the contract.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1532.162,1542.761,"It is not an issue before this Court, because there is nothing in the record which indicates that TWA made any other changes other than the ones that it had specifically proposed."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.761,1573.399,"Mr. Gartner, if it really were the law that some provisions of the contract survive until they are, at least until you have bargained to impasse on them, if that is the law, then you have the problem of distinguishing out this union security provision... which you have tried to do."
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1573.399,1573.849,Yes.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.849,1576.561,So you really have two provisions.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1580.184,1580.654,Yes.
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.777,1601.86,So that is a substitute for impasse bargaining.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1601.86,1606.973,"--Well, but then when you come to the end of that you are at an impasse on the entire contract."
1987.86-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.973,1607.654,Exactly.
1987.86-1650,0,35934,murray_gartner,,1607.654,1608.724,Thank you.
1987.86-1650,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.724,1610.715,"Thank you, Mr. Gartner."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1612.527,1615.769,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.452,1667.072,"That allegation that you repeated, was it on the contract or statute or what?"
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1667.072,1669.953,The District Court held both under the statute and under the contract.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.953,1671.676,But what about your argument?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1671.676,1679.419,"We believe that both under the contract and under the statute, either one or both, you can only make the changes you submitted to the process."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.419,1694.66,"So even if there hadn't been a provision in the contract, about any part of the contract surviving, the statute itself would say yes, everything survives except what has been submitted for change."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1694.66,1695.211,That is correct.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.211,1699.514,What about the provisions that have been submitted for change?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1699.514,1709.089,I think the only logical reading of Section 6 and Section 2 Seventh is those provisions which have been submitted for change may be altered by the carrier during the self help period.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.089,1719.546,"And if it is wages, why, as soon as the stay put period is over, the employer is free to go up or down on wages?"
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1719.546,1723.66,The carrier is free to implement the changes which have been proposed.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.66,1723.948,Right.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1723.948,1726.812,In which the National Mediation Board has performed its function.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.327,1741.652,But all the other provisions remain exactly the same?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1741.652,1746.574,"Provisions which have not been subject to the bargaining process of the Act may not be altered, yes."
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.574,1758.081,"But it really makes a big difference, at least to my understanding of the case, whether the reason any of the terms and conditions may not be changed is a contractual reason or a statutory reason."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1762.225,1764.616,"The Court of Appeals said that, that is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.616,1766.499,They did not reach the statutory issue.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1766.499,1767.127,that is correct.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.127,1774.814,"And if we read the contract otherwise, just read it as a plain, ordinary contract, it seems, by its terms, to expire."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1780.168,1783.36,"I disagree with that rather strongly, Your Honor, and the District Court did."
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.36,1785.321,I know the District Court read it the other way.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1785.321,1789.274,They preferred to express it as to what the parties themselves believed to be the effect of the contract.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.519,1797.84,Correct.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1800.963,1802.213,"Well, but it is somewhat difficult."
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.213,1803.974,Under ordinary grammar.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1806.347,1813.902,I think it is rather unusual to construe a notice of a specified intended change to be a signal that you may then make any change you wish whatsoever.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.902,1815.204,"No, that is not the point at all."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1833.758,1835.62,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, other than the Reeve Court."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.62,1837.38,Other than what?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1837.38,1840.601,Other than the Ninth Circuit Opinion in the Reeve case.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.601,1844.743,"So there is a holding right in your teeth, I guess."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1844.743,1855.602,But the other courts of appeal which use the word RLA contract do not use the word as TWA would use it.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.956,1863.168,Are they talking about the statute or are they talking about the contract?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1863.168,1869.003,Most of those cases... there are really only four cases that deal with changes a carrier may make during self help.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.003,1869.914,I understand.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1878.278,1883.144,"They mean expire so as to get to the status quo period, expire so as to get to the self help period."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.714,1916.298,But again is he saying that because the contract doesn't allow it or is he saying it because the statute doesn't allow it?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1916.298,1917.219,He is saying it under both.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.731,1922.262,But the Court of Appeals did not.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1922.262,1925.915,The Court of Appeals did not reach the pure statutory issue.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.406,1933.041,Except in construed the contract in light of the statute.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1933.041,1934.073,"It did make comments to that effect, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.067,1996.329,Did you talk about it in your brief?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,1996.329,1997.157,"Rather extensively, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2118.705,2131.204,It is hard to envision that Congress would have intended a scheme under which the working flight attendants here have to finance the union's efforts to displace them.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2133.498,2138.483,The union's primary objective is certainly not to displace the working flight attendant.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.305,2174.519,Did the union insist on collecting the agency fee during the strike?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2174.519,2177.03,"I don't know that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.553,2237.495,"On the other hand, I really wonder how successful any mediation effort is going to be if you are requiring the carrier, if it wishes to avoid the situation that has occurred here, to put on the table elimination of the union security agreement every time."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2251.943,2260.21,"There are several answers to that, Justice Scalia, the first of which is that that pretty much is the result of FEC."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.737,2303.931,You mean like a proposal that will only be operative during a strike?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2303.931,2305.771,"TWA made just such a proposal, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.698,2614.09,Was the United States a petitioner in that case?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2614.09,2619.603,"There were two consolidated cases and the United States was the plaintiff and petitioner in one of those two, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.603,2651.335,"Mr. Fehr, on this point, what language are you relying on in Section 156 which says hat where a change has been proposed, in every case where such notice of intended change has been given, blah, blah, blah, rates of pay, rules or working conditions, shall not be altered until the controversy has been finally acted upon?"
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2665.304,2679.885,"The operative language appears, I believe, in Section 2 Seventh, which says you shall not change agreements except in the manner contained in agreements or in Section 6, which we believe was enacted to say you can only make those changes you submitted through Section 6 procedures."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.729,2699.419,"That section may just refer to agreements that are continuing beyond, by their terms, beyond the negotiation period."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2699.419,2713.21,I find it hard to conceive of the notion that Congress enacted Section 2 Seventh only to deal with contracts that happen to be of indefinite duration without saying this section shall apply to contracts that are only of indefinite duration.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.389,2731.913,But you are not changing an agreement if the agreement is not in effect.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2734.003,2738.208,But 2 Seventh says you shall not change conditions as embodied in agreements.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.548,2743.18,Conditions as embodied in agreements.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2743.18,2746.833,"Well, if they just wanted to say contracts, they could have said you shall not change contracts."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.833,2750.356,How come you can change the expiration clause?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2750.356,2759.071,"You can vary... the expiration clause is really in most contracts, including this one, more of a moratorium clause."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.082,2765.716,So you are modifying what the expiration clause says.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2765.716,2767.496,"--Well, sure."
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.425,2851.388,May I interrupt you with one question before you go on?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2851.388,2851.465,--Sure.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.465,2860.421,Would you tell me what you understand Section 156 to mean when it says there shall be no change until the controversy has been finally acted upon?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2864.274,2868.799,I believe the controversy is the changes submitted to the bargaining procedures of the Act.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.711,2875.003,Just go a little slower for me.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2882.597,2890.523,They may change the conditions which were subject to the bargaining process.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.523,2890.684,Right.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2891.295,2891.905,That's right.
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.905,2893.717,But only as to their proposal.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2894.178,2897.882,I think that is the clear result of the FEC opinion and of the reading of Section--
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.882,2901.021,And they may never change anything else?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2901.021,2907.066,"--Anything over which they have no bargained, no, except insofar as necessary to operate in a strike--"
1987.86-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.066,2908.237,Under that case.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2908.237,2909.289,--in the FEC Opinion.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.289,2913.919,"And if the strike is over, they can never change?"
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2913.919,2914.26,No.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.267,2925.98,"Or, if the agreement itself provides for a change."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2933.103,2941.2,"Sure, if an agreement says in Year One you will be paid $8.00 and in Year Two you will be paid $9.00, that is a change in a manner prescribed in an agreement."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.375,2954.873,What if it says in Year Four our agreement as to what you will be paid will cease and you will be paid what we determine you will be paid?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2954.873,2956.833,"If it says that, I suppose you could do it."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.075,2958.823,It doesn't say that.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2966.749,2971.883,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that is implicit in the statutory scheme and I don't think that is implicit in Section 2 Seventh."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.39,2989.715,You mean that is different than saying this contract will expire completely on a date certain?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2989.715,2992.209,"But the contract does not use the word ""expire"", Justice White."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.209,2994.119,"Well, I know, but what if a contract does?"
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,2994.119,2997.301,"I still think it is different, yes, under Section 2 Seventh."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.301,3006.308,So that the parties may not provide for the expiration of a contract and the disappearance of all obligations of the--
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3006.308,3006.337,Yes.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.337,3009.75,--of the railroad to observe any working conditions?
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3009.75,3020.348,I agree with the District Court when it said that under the RLA you may not have contracts that completely self destruct upon notice of specified intended changes.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.348,3027.624,"That is, a I said a while ago, that is certainly changing a provision of the contract, without any bargaining."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3027.624,3032.295,"I don't think I am following you, Justice White."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.295,3038.9,"Well, the contract says expire, it is all over, and the union says sorry, but it isn't."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3040.993,3044.674,But this contract provides that it renews itself from year to year without change.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.674,3050.638,"But in my example, my example, all the contract says is it's over."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3050.638,3055.212,If the contract provides that the carrier may do what it pleases.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.212,3056.872,"No, it just says the contract is over."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3056.872,3062.078,Then I think under Section 6 and Section 2 Seventh you have to bargain over the specific changes you intend to make.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.699,3068.312,I know exactly what I said.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3068.312,3070.723,--But let me highlight a couple of words.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.153,3095.68,"So whether this is a contractual decision in this case or based on the law, it is open for de novo review here."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3095.68,3100.264,"Again, I don't follow the question."
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.264,3106.599,"Maybe both Courts may have agreed with each other below, but they agreed on a question of law."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3106.599,3111.643,They resorted to evidence in the record for aid in interpreting the contract.
1987.86-1650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.343,3119.276,But the meaning of the words in that contract certainly is not a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous rule.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3119.276,3126.241,The Court relied on evidence as to what the parties themselves who were at the bargaining table believed the clause to mean.
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.564,3140.483,"Mr. Fehr, it seems to me that your last concession really suggests that there is not as much policy involved in all of this as you have been saying."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3165.407,3169.241,"I suppose if you would get the union to agree to such an agreement, Your Honor, it would have that effect."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.241,3174.837,Unless you think the union agreed to that when it agreed to the fact that the contract terminates on such and such a date.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3174.837,3183.484,"But when the union agreed to it, the union, perhaps their counsel had read the FEC case and knew that you could only make the changes that you had submitted to the bargaining process."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.77,3195.512,"Even so, you are just talking about using the wrong words."
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3204.287,3210.472,"The central theme of the RLA, Justice Scalia, is you have to bargain over that which you intend to change."
1987.86-1650,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.927,3220.56,Unless you put the change in the agreement.
1987.86-1650,1,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3226.995,3229.907,"It is somewhat of a facetious example, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1650,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.64,3389.53,"Thank you, Mr. Fehr."
1987.86-1650,2,35934,murray_gartner,,3393.283,3395.384,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-1650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.583,3554.853,It wouldn't make any difference if you did.
1987.86-1650,2,35934,murray_gartner,,3555.704,3570.125,But it was also pointing out that the majority was dealing with a contract which everybody acknowledge was effect which was in effect at the time.
1987.86-1650,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.125,3572.127,"Thank you, Mr. Gartner."
