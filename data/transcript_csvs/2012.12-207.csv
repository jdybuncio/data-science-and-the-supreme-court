2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-207, Maryland v. King."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,9.022,11.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,28.25,29.4,"Well, that's really good."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,37.973,49.495,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, it does, in fact, point out the fact that -- that the statute is working, and in the State's view the act is constitutional."
2012.12-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,49.495,59.136,"So that's its purpose, to enable you to identify future criminals, the perpetrators of future crimes?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,63.604,67.825,"No, not -- not just to identify people."
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.233,84.518,And I'm having a hard time understanding the bail argument.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,95.226,97.178,"That's true, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.178,99.295,"And yet, he was detained anyway, correct?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,99.295,100.546,He was detained anyway.
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.546,108.55,"And -- and there might be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be the rare case."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,108.55,109.485,Well--
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.485,112.604,You don't use it routinely for the bail determination.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,112.604,115.223,"--At this point, you're absolutely correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,130.649,137.303,"Well, it doesn't include the time to collect the sample, send it to you or the time to do the match."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,140.688,143.623,"--No, that's the whole -- that's the whole process, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,213.251,219.671,"Your procedure limits the collection to certain violent offenses, right?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,219.671,220.44,"It does, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.44,222.974,"But your argument would not be so limited, would it?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,229.895,235.949,"Well, in Maryland, it's not just the fact that we have those -- those violent crimes and burglaries."
2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.153,242.603,"Well, I understand."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,251.542,266.318,"--Well, what I would say to that is that with respect to a traffic stop, this Court said in Berkheimer that a motorist has an expectation that a traffic stop is going to be relatively brief and temporary, that he or she will be given a citation and sent on their way."
2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.318,268.17,"Well, how long does it take to -- to undergo the procedure?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,270.205,281.145,"It doesn't take long, but what I was suggesting is that because of the nature of a traffic stop, this Court might well decide that a motorist has a reasonable expectation of privacy not to--"
2012.12-207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.145,282.013,How about a Terry stop?
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,284.563,294.155,"--In a Terry -- well, this Court, I guess, we would look at two -- one case in particular, this Court's case -- decision in Hayes v. Florida."
2012.12-207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.401,326.792,"But these -- these are all cases, I mean, the dominant use is to solve what they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,355.811,356.995,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.236,370.921,I do.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,373.105,376.123,"--Well, happily we don't have to decide that one today."
2012.12-207,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,399.722,401.09,"But, Ms. Winfree, that can't be quite right, can it?"
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,410.696,411.779,"That's correct, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-207,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,411.779,415.231,It doesn't have the right to search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,415.231,415.681,That's correct.
2012.12-207,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,415.681,426.456,Just because you've been arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy expectations and things you have that aren't related to the offense that you've been arrested for.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,426.456,427.472,That's correct.
2012.12-207,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,436.194,442.715,"Well, and if there were a real identification purpose for this, then I understand that argument."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,452.873,464.581,"--Well, I would say there's a very real distinction between the police generally rummaging in your home to look for evidence that might relate to your personal papers and your thoughts."
2012.12-207,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,478.488,483.792,"Well, but if that's what you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an arrestee."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,494.116,502.539,I think the difference there is these people are lawfully in custody having been arrested based on probable cause.
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,503.572,504.039,All right.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,561.792,562.642,--Well--
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.642,569.196,Because you're going to have to tell me why searching their person is different than searching their home or car.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,569.196,584.372,"--Well, if I could start at the back end of your question, Justice Sotomayor, we're not suggesting and this statute doesn't permit the State or police to search an arrestee's home or his person beyond -- beyond simply swabbing the cheek for the DNA."
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.728,625.699,There's no other case but Samson in that line that permits searches on this balancing.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,625.699,626.299,Well--
2012.12-207,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,626.299,630.103,So what I want to know is what's the legal theory now?
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,645.612,648.497,"--Well, those are different situations, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,661.622,664.491,Can I ask you a particular specific quick question?
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,664.491,665.276,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.276,674.464,"As I read this, this concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary or attempted burglary."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,674.464,675.148,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.148,679.433,And so we're not talking about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and all these other things.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,679.433,680.618,That's absolutely correct.
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.618,687.539,"The only thing we have to decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause to arrest a person for those four crimes, their fingerprints are all taken."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,687.539,688.622,Yes.
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.622,691.074,"And whether they also can take DNA, that's the issue."
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,691.074,692.557,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.557,692.824,Okay.
2012.12-207,0,34024,katherine_winfree,,693.543,697.078,"If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
2012.12-207,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,697.078,697.711,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,703.482,706.517,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,762.687,767.507,"Yes, but that doesn't mean, for example, that you can go into their house without a warrant."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,767.507,779.232,"That is certainly correct, Chief Justice Roberts, and the reason for that is going into the house will expose a substantial number of highly private things to the view of the State."
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.719,788.171,"Well, this is a factual question."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,808.549,815.238,"Well, by law, the government, under CODIS, and the States cannot look at anything except identification information."
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,855.546,857.065,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it really?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,895.94,911.117,"--You are not wrong, Justice Kagan, but the future is very close to where there will be rapid DNA analyzers that are devices that can analyze and produce the identification material in the DNA within 90 minutes."
2012.12-207,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.094,930.144,That part surprised us.
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,953.11,953.777,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-207,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.799,973.523,"In the case of -- do you have any information -- are there instances with fingerprints where returns have not come back for as long as 30 days, or are they all, or almost all, done in 5 minutes?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,973.523,979.611,--Fingerprint histories tend to come back quickly except if the prints are unrecognizable or unreadable.
2012.12-207,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.515,996.889,"Before you get on to -- before you go to that, fingerprints have been taken I believe from people who are booked for offenses for many, many, many years; isn't that right?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,996.889,997.389,--Correct.
2012.12-207,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,997.389,1005.661,When did the FBI's AFIS system for comparing fingerprints by computer begin?
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1005.661,1008.613,"That I cannot tell you, Justice Alito."
2012.12-207,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1026.424,1050.639,"Well, the question that I had was this: If the constitutionality of taking fingerprints is dependent on the speed with which a fingerprint comparison can be done now by a computerized system, would that mean that the taking of fingerprints was unconstitutional back in, let's say, the '50s when that wasn't possible and fingerprints could only be compared manually?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1050.639,1070.203,"No, I certainly do not think that it would have been unconstitutional at any point because the State has a compelling interest in taking biometric identification information from the individual that is arrested and using it for a myriad of purposes: Determining criminal history, attempting to solve crimes, funneling that information back--"
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1070.203,1072.67,"Mr. Dreeben, could I understand how this works exactly?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1083.26,1084.494,--That is correct.
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1084.494,1092.366,"And when the swab is taken and it's put into the system, you check that against the crime scene DNA database; is that correct?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1092.366,1095.485,"That is the routine method under CODIS, yes."
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1095.485,1099.187,Do you check it -- does Maryland check it against the known offenders database?
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1099.187,1103.174,I do not know precisely whether Maryland does that.
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1110.578,1120.72,"Because that suggests that right now it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, which is a good thing, you know, that we should solve some crimes, but not as an identification device."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1127.123,1145.168,"I agree with that and I think that in California the brief for the States indicates that many States do that and California itself uses it to resolve discrepancies in identity when a fingerprint comes back and it returns to multiple names, or the fingerprint is not good enough to permit an identification."
2012.12-207,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.384,1200.172,"Mr. Dreeben, can you explain how it works, mechanically?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1238.38,1250.187,--That serves an enhanced reliability function to ensure there is no mix-up and it provides an evidentiary function of permitting the new DNA match to be admitted in a sample that is taken under the warrant.
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.53,1271.518,"That argument only makes sense if we're in your future world where it's 90 minutes, right?"
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1271.518,1273.251,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1273.251,1286.527,"It depends on, if we have a situation such as Maryland says 11 to 17 days, the footnote, whatever, the amicus brief says something else, but you are not going to put off the bail hearing for 2 weeks."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1286.527,1296.383,"No, but bail can be revoked and the government will go back in and make a motion to revoke bail if new information emerges that indicates this individual is a danger to the community."
2012.12-207,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1316.713,1318.499,That doesn't explain why you can't go into his home.
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1318.499,1320.182,"Yes, it does, Justice--"
2012.12-207,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1320.182,1335.191,"I mean, you know, if the whole issue is how dangerous is he, you should be able to go into his home, into his car, to any place he has visited, to just sort of run rampant in his life to make sure that he is not a bail risk."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1335.191,1340.995,"--We are not asking for that, and I don't think that the Court's balancing test suggests that these two cases are equivalent."
2012.12-207,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1344.114,1357.807,"But you are, because what you are saying really is law enforcement need alone, without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime, permits you to take this information from the person and use it."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1357.807,1368.181,"--I'm saying that because an arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to probable cause that he committed a crime, he's in a different position from ordinary citizens."
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1384.007,1388.559,"According to Samson and Knights, you're dealing with people who are still subject to the -- a criminal sentence."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1388.559,1392.463,"--Well, they're differently situated in that respect, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1414.293,1423.249,"But the typical special needs case is one in which we say there's no law enforcement interest, that there's an interest other than the interest in solving crime."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1423.249,1429.303,"Well, we have a strong law enforcement interest with respect to people who are arrested based on probable cause."
2012.12-207,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1437.159,1443.83,"When you started, Mr. Dreeben, you started by saying, you know, they have a reduced expectation of privacy and we have important interests."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1469.528,1472.999,We're not asking for a new exception.
2012.12-207,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.521,1484.354,The key principle is the Fourth Amendment--
2012.12-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1484.354,1487.306,Is it -- is it your position that this is a search incident to an arrest?
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1487.306,1489.508,"--No, Justice Kennedy, it's not."
2012.12-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1493.876,1496.078,Why isn't this is a search incident to an arrest?
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1496.078,1497.863,--It is certainly a search--
2012.12-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.863,1504.684,Just -- just like taking the pockets out and -- and seeing what's in the person's overcoat and so forth is a search incident to an arrest.
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1504.684,1508.736,--You can certainly look at it as an incident of the arrest.
2012.12-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1541.207,1544.309,"Yes, but our -- our search incident to arrest cases don't allow that."
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1560.319,1561.935,"--That's inaccurate, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.543,1576.678,Evidence relating to matters other than the crime of arrest?
2012.12-207,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1576.678,1578.18,"--Yes, on -- on the individual's person."
2012.12-207,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.909,1624.427,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1626.694,1630.248,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1644.505,1648.524,He was held -- he was held with probable cause--
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1648.524,1650.726,--That is correct.
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1650.726,1652.361,--and his -- and his custody was restrained.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1653.111,1654.897,That is also correct.
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.897,1658.499,"Were handcuffs put on him during the transport process, do you know?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1658.499,1660.315,I don't know that the record indicates that.
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1660.315,1662.301,But they -- they could -- they could have been.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1662.301,1663.034,Yes.
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.034,1665.902,So his liberties were constrained in all of those respects.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1670.556,1671.306,We're--
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1671.306,1673.341,They could look -- they could look in his -- in his briefcase.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1673.341,1674.174,--Yes.
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.64,1700.242,I think -- I think there is some merit to your argument in that regard.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1707.931,1708.297,--That is correct.
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.966,1711.966,"Well, that is right."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1726.892,1738.414,"I would concede, Mr. Chief Justice, that it -- that it could be taken at least while he is still under the supervision of the State, because after all, both Samson and Knights were cases in which the individual was still under State supervision."
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.148,1771.254,"What is the pertinence of the fact -- I mean, this is not something that people are or can keep private."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1779.591,1781.527,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.527,1783.395,Doesn't that compromise the -- the expectation of privacy?
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1783.395,1794.517,--I think it's an open question as to whether or not there would be a search when DNA is collected from cells that could be said to have been involuntarily or voluntarily abandoned.
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.61,1809.377,"No, it's not a--"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1809.377,1810.129,--the privacy interest.
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.129,1823.954,"--My question was not trying to get at whether it's a search or not, it's whether -- it's getting at the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy that the -- your DNA is protected from examination when it's left wherever you happened to have been."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1823.954,1827.758,I would say two things about the privacy interests at stake here.
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.973,1858.61,"Well, I mean, isn't that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in a person's DNA?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1858.61,1863.014,"--Yes, and we think that the answer to that question is yes, that an individual has--"
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.014,1865.447,"Well, I know, but you're simply just -- you're -- I guess that's begging the question."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1885.343,1897.735,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I've heard Mr. Dreeben concede, as I think he must, that an individual retains a legitimate expectation of privacy in at least some of the information contained in the individual's DNA."
2012.12-207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.41,1917.481,"Mr. Shanmugam, I -- I wouldn't have made the concession that you've made, that this case is about reasonable expectation of privacy."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1931.841,1934.443,"Justice Scalia, I didn't think I was conceding anything."
2012.12-207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.443,1935.56,"Well, I thought you did."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1935.56,1937.728,"If I was, let me just be clear."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.466,1950.536,"Well, do you think the intrusion is worse when you just take a swab and you go inside somebody's cheek, as opposed to rolling fingerprints?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1952.487,1958.558,"Well, we think that it is settled that intrusions into the body constitutes a search for Fourth Amendment purposes."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.558,1959.041,Which is--
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1959.041,1967.164,"I suppose that the argument could be made, Justice Alito, that there is a similar trespass on the person and, therefore, a search when fingerprints are collected."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1978.905,1990.946,"--Well, the thrust of a lot of what we have been presented with in the briefs and what we have heard this morning -- and by the way, I think this is perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this Court has heard in decades."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2030.738,2035.308,"--Justice Alito, we think that fingerprinting is distinguishable on three grounds."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2047.783,2056.222,"Well, as to the first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a urine sample is taken to determine drug use."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2073.6,2074.016,--But that is because--
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2074.016,2075.116,--that can be obtained from it.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2075.116,2084.991,"--But that is because, Justice Alito, in those cases, cases like Skinner and Von Raab and Vernonia, there was a special need apart from the ordinary interests in law enforcement."
2012.12-207,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2106.572,2107.755,What are your other two distinctions?
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2107.755,2129.77,"With regard to fingerprinting, we think that, notwithstanding the physical intrusion involved with taking an individual's fingers and putting them on the pad, that the better view is that fingerprinting is not a search, and to the extent that this Court has addressed the question it has suggested that fingerprinting is not a search because an individual has no expectation of privacy in their fingerprints because their fingers are constantly exposed--"
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.77,2135.424,"I would like to give a complete answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were asking, I think."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2193.729,2194.212,--Sure.
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.212,2201.549,"And by the way, when you talk about what information you could get out of it, there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the field."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2229.803,2230.686,"Justice Breyer, let me--"
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.686,2233.171,"Now, you tell me in light of that hostile question--"
2012.12-207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.11,2244.395,He gave us one and two.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2248.297,2254.501,"--Let me -- I will gladly get to three with regard to fingerprinting, and then I would like to say a word about balancing in the event that the Court reaches it."
2012.12-207,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2281.818,2286.27,"Mr. Shanmugam, this seems to me a real distinction in this case as it's been litigated."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2303.732,2317.14,"And my response to that would be that under the special needs doctrine, what is relevant is not how a system could conceivably operate; what is relevant is the primary purpose behind the program at issue."
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.19,2346.225,A person has been arrested for a felony and is in custody.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2355.331,2364.353,"The justice system always has an interest in law enforcement and solving crimes, and we certainly don't dispute that proposition."
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.128,2394.075,My question is whether or not the police who have John Doe in custody for a felony have an interest in knowing at the outset or within a few weeks time whether or not that person has committed other crimes?
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2394.075,2406.799,"--The difference between an arrestee and an ordinary citizen, Justice Kennedy, is that as to an arrestee the police have probable cause to believe that the arrestee committed a particular offense."
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.799,2409.751,But they also have a reason for keeping him in custody.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2409.751,2410.917,Related--
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.917,2418.957,"And my question is, do they have an interest and a legitimate interest in knowing if that person has committed other crimes?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2418.957,2427.896,"--They have that interest, but if they want to investigate other crimes, they have to do what they would have to do as to an ordinary citizen."
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2431.748,2433.283,"There are two different, two different interests."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2476.127,2482.965,The touchstone of the analysis under the special needs doctrine is what was the primary purpose of the program at issue.
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.619,2492.738,"That's because, that's because we are not yet at a situation where it takes 90 minutes."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2502.427,2508.348,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I said to Justice Kagan, the constitutional analysis may very well change at later point."
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2522.274,2523.124,"Well, let's put it this way."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2538.1,2543.354,"Well, outside the programmatic context, ordinary Fourth Amendment rules would apply."
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.288,2544.79,"Well, what does that mean?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2545.423,2554.229,"--Well, i think in that circumstance, where there is no individualized suspicion, a search cannot occur, and an arrestee stands--"
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.229,2555.996,"Well, we do it -- doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2566.036,2577.844,"--Well, you know, I will say that the one thing that is slightly different about your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the analysis might be somewhat different where what you are talking about is a condition of release."
2012.12-207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.518,2642.954,But we are also talking about identity.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2667.919,2675.341,I am not disputing that the government has an interest in knowing about prior offenses that an individual has committed.
2012.12-207,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.732,2697.921,"I thought fingerprinting -- Mr. Shanmugam, I thought fingerprinting was used to determine whether they -- the person has a record."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2716.418,2738.081,"--Fingerprints taken upon booking are primarily used for the purpose of identification, and by identification I would include determining whether the individual had a prior criminal record, because as IAFIS is currently structured, that is information that is returned once there is a hit for that initial search."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2738.081,2744.569,What was the purpose of fingerprinting before it was possible to make fingerprint comparisons by computer?
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2744.569,2760.197,"Well, I think fingerprinting really has from the outset served the purpose of identification, because fingerprinting really came into being approximately 100 years ago, because in large urban areas officers could no longer identify individuals on sight."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2771.236,2789.883,"Well, I would assume that before it was possible to do computer searches, the way in which fingerprinting established identification, what it did in that respect was to identify the person arrested on this occasion so that if the person was arrested again, then the police would know that it was the same person."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2804.476,2805.593,--That is true.
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2817.033,2817.683,Can we go back to--
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2817.683,2827.473,"Yes, so you know that on day one you have arrested -- you've arrested Mr. X, and then a year later you arrest somebody else and you know it's Mr. X again."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2830.591,2847.153,"--But I think it's important to realize, Justice Alito, that at least as the DNA system is currently constituted, when an arrestee's profile is prepared, it is compared against the offender and arrestee indices, not the forensic index."
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.002,2875.406,I think I can totally lose this because I have a confusion that you can clear up.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2906.925,2907.341,--Sure.
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.341,2907.96,What does it do?
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2907.96,2912.495,We think it means determining or confirming the identity of an individual.
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.495,2913.864,"What does that mean, confirming his identity?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2918.399,2924.32,"Confirming, for instance, in this case that the individual in the government's custody was Alonzo King."
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.32,2925.07,"Oh, really?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2931.992,2935.444,"Well, but 73 million people are in the criminal offender--"
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2935.444,2938.162,But to determine what his name really is.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2938.162,2941.848,"--And his criminal entity, sure, his adjudicated criminal history, which can also be--"
2012.12-207,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.848,2942.198,Right.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2970.05,2972.652,"--Justice Breyer, no, I think with respect you haven't."
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2989.345,3006.457,"--Counsel, so I am really worried about the question you haven't satisfied me with, which is I agree completely that today it's used primarily and almost exclusively for purposes of solving other crimes."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3028.989,3029.722,Sure.
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3030.906,3038.012,Tell me what the -- why you would then say that would still be unconstitutional.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3038.012,3045.682,"--Justice Sotomayor, assuming that this Court does not accept the proposition that arrestees are somehow subject to a lessened expectation of privacy--"
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3045.682,3045.999,Right.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3052.771,3053.104,--Right.
2012.12-207,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3082.391,3086.493,"Just suppose -- I mean, I guess the question is would this be unconstitutional?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3117.028,3127.217,"I think that it could be, and that would simply be because you would have a system where DNA testing is essentially being used as fingerprinting is being used today."
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3128.384,3132.454,"I was interested in a broader thought process, actually."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3133.87,3134.32,--Well--
2012.12-207,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3134.32,3142.142,"Which is, there is something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that is not the same as fingerprinting."
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3142.142,3154.717,"--Well, there is, and that gets me back finally to the rest of Justice Breyer's question from a few minutes ago, because Justice Breyer had kind of asked how the analysis should work in the event that the Court were to proceed to balancing."
2012.12-207,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.533,3240.656,You disclose all of this intimate private information when you take a drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind.
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3240.656,3252.131,"But, Mr. Chief Justice, as I said at the outset, we believe that there might still be -- indeed, we think the better view under this Court's cases is that there would still be a Fourth Amendment search there."
2012.12-207,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3261.052,3270.908,"What if someone has a bloody shirt and throws it away in the trash -- in a public trash can along the street, you are saying that the police can't analyze that without a search warrant?"
2012.12-207,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3270.908,3279.031,--The argument would be that the subsequent analysis of the DNA nevertheless still constitutes a search.
