1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,29.401,32.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.232,225.58,"Mr. Landry, do you take the position that any action by the union that harms one of its members is actionable?"
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,225.58,231.384,--We... action which would--
1989.88-124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.384,233.184,It doesn't have to be discipline.
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,233.184,236.166,--Not under a duty of fair representation analysis.
1989.88-124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.683,252.288,"So it isn't necessary, in your view in this case, for it to constitute disciplinary action."
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,253.34,254.611,--It needn't... no.
1989.88-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.156,318.413,"To violate the National Labor Relations Act, however, doesn't the action have to relate to the individuals rights as an employee?"
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,347.343,367.538,"--With respect to the duty of fair representation act... duty of fair representation doctrine, the cases have considered the duty of fair representation of the union to be co-extensive to its authority as a representative of the individual."
1989.88-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.356,370.069,"Well, as a representative vis a vis the employer."
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,378.304,391.364,"--We believe it... yes, it... it would, but it could go beyond that as far as the unions negotiation, collective bargaining agreement, the administration of the collective bargaining agreement--"
1989.88-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.364,396.477,All of which relate to what the individual employee gets from the employer.
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,410.815,413.579,--As long--
1989.88-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.579,414.878,Or prospective employer.
1989.88-124,0,24268,francis_j_landry,,414.878,415.539,--Yes.
1989.88-124,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1258.235,1271.682,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-124,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.644,1740.869,"Mr. Shapiro, may I... may I ask... am I correct that it doesn't make any difference, as far as this Claimant is concerned, if we uphold the LMRDA claim, so long as we uphold the NLRA claim."
1989.88-124,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1742.651,1745.781,"Yes, there may be, Your Honor, because the--"
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1890.538,1897.223,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.334,2260.07,"Mr. Gold, am I correct in understanding that the other side of that coin is that you would agree that if the allegations in count 2 were included in count 1, namely that the unfair use of the... alleged unfair use of the hiring clause... hiring hall, was for retaliation against some kind of activity, that would allege a violation of the duty of fair representation?"
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2260.07,2261.039,No.
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.168,2328.104,"But what you're saying is that if the allegations in count 1 were made in a charge before the Labor Board, the Labor Board would properly deny jurisdiction."
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2328.104,2334.379,"No, the Labor Board would properly find that an unfair labor practice had been committed, and give the individual the remedy."
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.379,2337.38,Even if it were not for retaliatory reasons.
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2339.942,2341.555,"No, I apologize."
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.186,2344.707,"--No, no."
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2350.631,2351.292,Correct.
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.292,2359.576,"If they included the allegations in count 2 in count 1, then the Labor Board, under your view, would have jurisdiction and, therefore, the Court would not, because it's--"
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2359.576,2360.267,Right.
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.0,2520.024,--May I ask another question to be sure I understand your theory?
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2520.024,2520.423,Yup.
1989.88-124,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.423,2532.922,"Supposing the union, for a non-union related reason, said they would apply... use the hiring hall procedure only to recommend white applicants and not recommend any black applicants."
1989.88-124,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2543.06,2544.158,That's correct.
