1991.90-741,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear argument next in No. 90-741, Aletha Dewsnup v. Louis Timm."
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,64.407,72.262,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-741,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.237,171.378,"Mr. Dyk, did you say a moment ago that under the act of 1898 and the Chandler Act, the pre-code, that it was unclear what happened to liens?"
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,171.378,172.544,It was unclear.
1991.90-741,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,265.988,270.725,"Well, Mr. Dyk, does the secured creditor still have the option of staying under the bankruptcy?"
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,270.725,273.326,"Well, the answer is yes and no."
1991.90-741,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.55,287.717,So he doesn't have a choice.
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,287.717,291.371,"--Well, he has a choice, but it's not just his choice."
1991.90-741,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.442,300.81,He doesn't have the same choice he did under the pre-code bankruptcy?
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,300.81,315.904,"No, and that was an important part of the 1978 code, was to bring the secured creditors into the bankruptcy to deal with their claims and to avoid these wandering liens which might exist to the extent that the lien exceeded the value of the property."
1991.90-741,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.864,339.232,"Could you tell us, Mr. Dyk, how does the valuation work?"
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,347.652,347.735,Yes.
1991.90-741,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.815,375.385,"I suppose if the value has gone up after the time of filing, then the trustee wouldn't abandon it and we wouldn't have this problem."
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,375.385,386.61,"Well, that's true, and there is a contention here that allowing the debtor to keep any increase in the case of abandoned property creates an unfairness."
1991.90-741,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.808,426.401,"If there is a misvaluation, supposing the bankruptcy court says the property is worth $50,000, it turns out it's later sold without any interim improvements for $125,000."
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,430.02,436.625,"Well, there is only a provision for the setting of one value in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the first value would prevail."
1991.90-741,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.451,486.439,"Well, that's always true, I take it, in the relations between the debtor and the lienholder."
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,486.439,489.991,"Well, there's always a tension between the debtor and the lienholder."
1991.90-741,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.991,492.674,"Of course, that's what the lienholder bargained for."
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,492.674,506.398,"The lienholder bargained for that, but the idea of bankruptcy is to discharge some of these debts as personal liabilities and to enable the parties to go forward."
1991.90-741,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.328,581.38,Is that true under the Attorney General's interpretation?
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,581.38,592.92,"Under the Attorney General's interpretation, the only part of the lien... the only time that a lien would be avoided under 506(d) is if it were a disallowed claim."
1991.90-741,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.474,788.843,The court of appeals said that 506(a) didn't apply to abandoned property.
1991.90-741,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,788.843,792.295,I understand the court of appeals said that.
1991.90-741,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.019,960.305,"Very well, Mr. Dyk."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,963.173,970.161,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-741,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.571,1018.741,"Mr. Taranto, would you state again what everybody agrees 506(d) accomplishes?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1018.741,1027.949,"That if the claim secured by the lien has been partly or wholly disallowed, the lien is reduced to reflect the disallowance of the claim."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.949,1032.067,"Well, that's the United States' position, is that it?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1032.067,1034.435,It is also the Government's position that... that's right.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.221,1037.621,Yes.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1037.621,1039.757,The fact that--
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.757,1043.392,"Under your other position, what does 506(d) do?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1043.392,1045.575,--It reaches the identical result.
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.394,1151.227,"May I interrupt, to be sure I follow the argument."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1161.285,1161.968,--Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.968,1167.872,"And isn't it, in this case, the amount over the value of the property... that is not an allowed secured claim, is it?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1167.872,1169.188,"Well, I think that that would--"
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.188,1169.955,It's an unsecured claim.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1169.955,1176.894,"--I think the language could be read that way, and would not dispute the petitioner's reading is a permissible reading of that language, in isolation."
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.266,1187.749,Right.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1187.749,1192.153,Petitioner herself does not read that language in isolation or literally.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.073,1329.775,What about the 3 percent?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1329.775,1343.749,"--Well, in the 3 percent, there will either be... there will be a bifurcation of the claim, and (d) will then follow (a)."
1991.90-741,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.583,1371.933,That's Long against Bullard?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1371.933,1383.057,"That's Long against Bullard, as continued in the 1898 act by section 67(d), as explained by this Court in Louisville State... Joint State Bank against Radford."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.865,1398.983,"Okay, the secured creditor comes in and bifurcates the claim."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1401.602,1402.352,Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.352,1405.904,Then what does (d) to... (d) do to it?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1405.904,1409.875,"If the claim has been fully allowed, (d) is simply inapplicable."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.475,1417.361,"Well, the claim is that the... the claim... the claim has not been fully allowed as a secured claim."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1417.361,1423.515,"--No, but it has been fully allowed as a claim under 502, which is the provision for the allowance of claims."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.556,1439.31,"But then (d) has no application whatsoever, is that it?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1439.31,1440.377,--I'm... that's right.
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.212,1446.964,"Now that's the Solicitor General's argument, as I understand it."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1446.964,1455.82,"--Yes, and it's the second argument we presented in our brief, which we in fact think is the... the only affirmative function served by 506(d)."
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.82,1457.771,So you're in agreement with his interpretation?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1457.771,1458.405,Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.405,1463.092,"Well, let me just ask another question, because I'm a little dense on this."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1483.756,1498.765,"He's entitled to that $5,000 unless receiving that $5,000 plus the actual amount distributed on his unsecured claim would give him more than the... than the complete debt, unless he's getting paid--"
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.765,1511.99,"All right, but we'd assume that that wouldn't happen, that there's enough in the general... isn't that then saying that the lien continues to secure the unsecured portion of the total claim?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1519.096,1520.996,--It does in one sense.
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1647.529,1669.375,"Is it a plausible hypothetical that a creditor who is a lienholder would receive some distribution as a... from the general estate to the extent that his claim is undersecured, and that that would happen before there is a sale on the property and a foreclosure of the lien?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1669.375,1674.929,"Well we're... first of all, we're talking only about the 3 percent of cases out of half a million bankruptcy cases."
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.929,1677.314,"Well, within that 3 percent, is that a plausible hypothetical?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1677.314,1678.181,It is plausible.
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1678.181,1679.833,And what would happen then?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1690.308,1695.443,"Under State law, the amount of the lien follows the amount of the outstanding debt."
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.746,1712.554,"But this... then this is still, though, the same as Justice Stevens' question, to the extent that the amount of the foreclosure brings in more than the valuation of the property, he still takes that as a secured creditor?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1712.554,1731.349,"If he has already received a payment through the bankruptcy proceeding, before the foreclosure, then by the time of the foreclosure, the lien will have been reduced by that amount... not by the amount of the unsecured claim, but by the perhaps 10 percent, 5 percent that he is being paid on that claim."
1991.90-741,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.349,1738.92,"But to the extent that he is still undersecured, if the property does bring in more than anticipated, he still picks up the balance?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1738.92,1757.499,"Yes, because he is still, of course, owed money, the collateral has, in fact, produced money to repay his debt, what he bargained for was the right to proceed against that collateral... and it seems to us, simply to be a windfall to the debtor to pay that money to the debtor."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.958,1799.66,Was this same argument made in the court of appeals?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1799.66,1805.064,"--The case, in fact, was not argued in the court of appeals."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.282,1812.301,"Well, was it... was it brief... the same arguments made down in brief?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1812.301,1817.038,"Most of the supporting arguments, yes, indeed were."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.371,1822.59,I take it you're not defending the court of appeals' rationale here.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1822.59,1826.059,"--Basically, that's right."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.876,1841.486,"They had a... you don't defend the notion that the case can turn on whether or not the estate has an interest in the property, in abandoned property?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1841.486,1846.355,"--No, in fact, I think that that phrase is, in fact, something of a red herring."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.013,1860.031,So you want to... you want to affirm on another ground.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1860.031,1869.97,"For a different reason, on the same statutory ground, but yes, for a different reason, a different reading of the statute than the one that the Tenth Circuit relied on."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.502,1904.576,"And you think it's perfectly clear that under the... under the old code, the 1930... under the Chandler Act, that your client would have won?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1904.576,1907.445,"Yes, I don't think there's... there can be any doubt about that at all."
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.778,1910.897,I take it your colleague on the other side disagrees with you.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1910.897,1915.199,"--Well, I haven't, frankly, just seen any... any reason to doubt that."
1991.90-741,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.176,1960.461,"Well, what is the incentive for a creditor to bifurcate his claim?"
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1960.461,1963.763,If there is some money that will be distributed.
1991.90-741,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.763,1965.696,If the... for general creditors.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1965.696,1966.446,For general creditors.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.898,1988.192,"Well, I suppose if there is money to be distributed to general creditors, and he comes in, and he wants to share in it... and yet he also wants to... to have... he wants his lien to survive."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1988.192,1989.542,--Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.542,2004.702,"And so he gets his share of whatever is distributed to general creditors, to the extent he's got an unsecured claim, he gets to share in the distribution."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2004.702,2005.368,Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.368,2007.654,But then he also has his lien.
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2016.593,2018.693,"Right, he's bargained for more than other creditors."
1991.90-741,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2054.013,2060.503,"Yes, but in that case, would a valuation... as I read the statute, I thought the valuation generally would take place at the time of any proposed distribution."
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2066.322,2080.916,"This whole dispute arises in only two circumstances; either the petitioner is right that the value is of value as of the time of the filing of the petition, and there's appreciation... which, in fact, the majority rule is to the contrary, or the judge makes an error."
1991.90-741,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.639,2095.759,Mr. Taranto--
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2108.517,2109.217,Yes.
1991.90-741,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.217,2110.117,Why?
1991.90-741,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2110.117,2114.504,"Well, because I think the purposes are quite different."
1991.90-741,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.891,2150.427,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2153.212,2163.484,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-741,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2272.37,2279.524,"But in that case, there is a windfall, in some sense, in that he's received pro rata too much from the unsecured portion of the estate."
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2279.524,2280.49,That's correct.
1991.90-741,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.969,2335.591,"Isn't this all kind of... you give the impression, Mr. Mann, this is all kind of optional, that well maybe it could be, maybe it couldn't... the statute doesn't provide one way or the other?"
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2335.591,2337.859,The statute is very unclear on this.
1991.90-741,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.464,2384.535,Do you know enough about bankruptcy practice to know what sort of a hearing this initial valuation is?
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2391.272,2399.009,"I think it generally depends upon the value of the collateral, and the unlikeliness of an error, and the amount of money that's at stake."
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.291,2500.659,May I ask you a question about pre-code practice before you get into that?
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2515.003,2521.007,"Um, under pre-code practice, there were three options that a secured creditor had."
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.577,2529.044,Right.
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2529.044,2532.446,"Okay, he could just stay out of the bankruptcy proceeding, not get anything--"
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.446,2532.898,Right.
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2532.898,2538.183,"--and then after the bankruptcy proceeding eventually foreclose, but he wouldn't have any personal recourse against the debtor."
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.776,2559.798,"But did he... is one... was one of his options was to have the land protect his secured position to the value of the property, and be an unsecured creditor for the balance?"
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2559.798,2561.448,We think that that's fairly clear.
1991.90-741,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.231,2612.431,What case were you reading from?
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2612.431,2618.052,"That's from Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, at pages 582 and 583."
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.052,2623.722,"Yeah, but what you've read... what you've read I don't think addresses the precise question I asked."
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2623.722,2626.138,It doesn't address that precise question directly.
1991.90-741,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.562,2720.747,"Excuse me, go back over that last point for just a minute."
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2720.747,2727.568,"Petitioner's general submission is that the reference in section 506(d) to a claim that is not an allowed, secured claim--"
1991.90-741,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.568,2728.085,Right.
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2728.085,2733.054,--refers not only to claims that are secured but not allowed... with which we agree--
1991.90-741,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.054,2733.554,Right.
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2733.554,2736.84,--but also to claims that are allowed but not secured.
1991.90-741,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.529,2746.231,If I could ask you just one question?
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2760.972,2763.322,"If you read it that way, it would change the meaning of the statute."
1991.90-741,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.328,2774.863,--Had you finished the answer to my question?
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2774.863,2775.731,No.
1991.90-741,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.731,2776.581,I didn't think so.
1991.90-741,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2777.364,2781.283,I'm going to try and be as brief as possible.
1991.90-741,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.378,2826.578,"Thank you, Mr. Mann."
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2830.448,2838.185,"Justice Scalia, I had difficulty in following the United States argument in that respect, too."
1991.90-741,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.229,2862.55,"But, but may I just interrupt, because I'm trying to think through Justice Scalia's problem, too."
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2869.12,2878.243,"--Well, I don't think it can be read that way because 506(a) necessarily has to apply to abandoned property."
1991.90-741,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.345,2881.645,"Well, I'm not so sure about that."
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2897.889,2901.425,"--Right, the property in this case is abandoned to the debtor."
1991.90-741,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.159,2935.813,"But the purpose of that is to protect the creditor's interest to the extent it's unsecured, isn't that right?"
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2944.251,2945.401,--That is one purpose.
1991.90-741,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.441,2985.745,"But is it not right, though, that the problem only arises if the valuation is not made at the time of the disposition?"
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2985.745,2992.899,"The... well, I think the answer to that is no."
1991.90-741,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.531,3107.755,"That's almost built into the statute, that difficulty, from the way everybody says the initial valuation controls, even though the foreclosure sale produces a much different price."
1991.90-741,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3107.755,3111.624,"--Well, I think there are many ways around it."
