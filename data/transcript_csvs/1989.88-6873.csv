1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.726,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-6873, Chandler Clemons v. Mississippi."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,19.375,21.514,Thank you.
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.255,346.781,"Do you think that the court must do more than that, in order for... you say they didn't really reweigh."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,349.542,358.459,"Your Honor, it's Petitioner's contention in this case that the Mississippi Supreme Court does not have the authority under state law to reweigh, and--"
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.459,366.924,"Well, but if they say they have the authority under state law to reweigh, or they do in fact reweigh, that concludes that question, doesn't it?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,366.924,376.701,"--Your Honor, the only reweighing, it is Petitioner's... the reweighing that was spoken of in the proportionality review section of the opinion speaks only to proportionality."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.583,477.115,"Would the case be different here, constitutionally, in your view, if the supreme court of Mississippi had said in its opinion we have the authority to reweigh these factors, and we now reweigh them and find that the result is justified?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,477.115,479.985,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.822,504.392,"So the... no matter, even if they had said what I just said in this opinion, you would say, citing the earlier opinions in which they have said we don't have authority to find fact, that they were simply mistaken as to their authority under state law in this case?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,504.392,520.14,"--I don't believe, Your Honor, that they were mistaken as to their authority under state law in connection with their ability to look at the balance struck in this case and compare it as part of a proportionality review with other cases."
1989.88-6873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.407,529.53,"Mr. Resnick, why is that a question of fact?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,543.11,549.424,"--What the Mississippi Supreme Court has referred to in this case and other cases, is that it will not find facts on appeals."
1989.88-6873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.62,562.433,Was there a factual issue as to... as to any of the mitigating circumstances or the aggravating circumstances?
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,562.433,563.144,--In this case?
1989.88-6873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.144,563.495,Yes.
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,565.558,576.325,"Well, for example, Mr. Clemons testified in his own defense at this case, and part of his testimony was offered in mitigation, his expression of remorse, his background."
1989.88-6873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.861,615.124,"--You mean it makes the findings, it doesn't recite the findings."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,615.124,615.845,It doesn't... I am sorry.
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.098,647.296,"Well, the Fifth Circuit seems to agree that the Mississippi Supreme Court has the authority under state law to do just what it did in this case, the Skargy case, it seems to say so."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,647.296,650.248,"What the... excuse me, Your Honor."
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.815,674.805,"I know that, but this was no more than a... before Maynard the Mississippi courts were doing this, and the Fifth Circuit has more than once seemed to recognize it as a practice under Mississippi law."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,674.805,704.004,"--What the Fifth Circuit has said is that the Mississippi Supreme Court has from time to time, in dicta... it was never the holding of the court, because they had always found that the specially heinous aggravating circumstance was found... in dicta has said where one aggravating circumstance, or more aggravating circumstances, is invalid, either under state law or under the federal constitution, a remaining valid aggravating circumstance will be sufficient to uphold the death penalties."
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.004,716.452,"Well, it said that Mississippi... Mississippi law is clear, that one invalid aggravating circumstance will not suffice to a return."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,717.724,721.828,"That is what the Fifth Circuit said, and it is Petitioner's contention... I am sorry; excuse me."
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.828,723.628,There was a Mississippi judge on the panel.
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,723.628,763.437,"It's Petitioner's contention that when the Mississippi Supreme Court has applied this rule, in other words, where one aggravating circumstance does not outweigh... or, excuse me, where one aggravating circumstance, or insufficient or invalid aggravating circumstance, will not outweigh... I am sorry, will not invalidate the death sentence, it's Petitioner's contention that this is being applied in a mechanical fashion."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.575,775.475,"Well, why... why is that unconstitutional?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,775.475,794.59,"--The problem is... is that... the constitutional problem here is that, in this case, and under the Mississippi statutory scheme, aggravating circumstances play a very important role in guiding the discretion of the jury."
1989.88-6873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,917.136,924.732,"Mr. Resnick, did the court employ also a harmless error analysis, do you think, in its opinion?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,924.732,926.224,--The federal harmless error analysis?
1989.88-6873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,926.224,928.735,That met the Chapman standard.
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,934.78,945.705,"The court did state in its opinion that it found that the same result would occur had the jury not considered the especially heinous aggravating circumstance, and they found that beyond reasonable doubt."
1989.88-6873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.486,1033.654,"Well, you don't take the position that the Mississippi Supreme Court could not apply a harmless error standard to a sentencing error, do you?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1033.654,1048.073,"That's correct, as long as that harmless error analysis was consistent with this Court's expression of that standard in the cases such as Satterwhite and Johnson and Chapman, Your Honor."
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.055,1059.013,"Well, if it went, if it really carried that out in detail it would be probably exactly what they would do if they expressly reweighed."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1059.013,1066.087,"--Your Honor, I can't come to that conclusion for one particular reason."
1989.88-6873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.718,1072.552,"Well, it may be they would have had to do more on the harmless error than they would just by reweighing."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1072.552,1084.69,"--Your Honor, the problem with reweighing, the constitutional problem with reweighing, is that the Mississippi Supreme Court has already professed the fact that it is practically incapable of finding fact."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.198,1143.711,"Mr. Resnick, the Supreme Court of Mississippi, towards the end of the majority opinion at page 49 of the joint appendix, says that Mississippi law holds one invalidating... one invalidated aggravating circumstance will not suffice to overturn a death penalty where one or more valid aggravating circumstances remain."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1147.124,1159.441,"--That is precisely what the Mississippi Supreme Court is expressing, and it is Petitioner's contention that that construction of its own law is unconstitutional."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.441,1161.992,Under the federal constitution.
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1161.992,1162.423,Correct.
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.423,1164.036,"And why, again, is that?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1164.036,1166.527,For a number of reasons.
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.956,1187.494,"Well, but we have certainly held in other cases, in Spaziano, that the jury is not a necessary part of the sentencing phase of a death case."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1187.494,1188.583,--In... that's correct.
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.253,1208.448,"Well, in Cabana we said an appellate court could make findings in connection with sentencing."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1208.448,1217.543,"--In connection with proportionality analysis of the Edmund findings, that that is the type of appellate fact finding that would be permissible."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.543,1221.555,"Why is that... why is one type permissible and the other not, under the federal constitution?"
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1221.555,1238.257,"Because in this case what we are asking the sentencing authority to do is to make a moral judgment and factual finding with respect to multiple issues, with respect to multiple issues in aggravation."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.167,1245.4,"Well, any court that reweighs, like the Florida court, is going to make some sort of a moral judgment."
1989.88-6873,0,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,1254.857,1259.401,"That's correct, as long as it is a well-informed judgment."
1989.88-6873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.636,1489.448,"Very well, Mr. Resnick."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1491.4,1498.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.929,1528.985,"Does it have just a flat, automatic rule, so long as one aggravating circumstance remains, it will affirm a death penalty?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1528.985,1529.475,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1529.475,1530.407,No?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1530.407,1537.32,That has been most recently graphically pointed out in the remand in Johnson v. Mississippi.
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.04,1591.406,"But does it have an automatic rule that if there are two aggravating circumstances, and one drops out, that it will affirm--"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1591.406,1595.93,"--No, I don't think there is any automatic rule in effect here."
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.22,1601.884,"--You don't read the opinion as suggesting that's its rule, then?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1601.884,1602.344,--No.
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.873,1616.224,Do they say that in the opinion anywhere?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1617.035,1620.718,"--No, I don't think they said it in this particular opinion."
1989.88-6873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.718,1629.704,Is it plausible to read this opinion as resting on a harmless error analysis and not on a reweighing analysis?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1629.704,1650.269,"I think that, with the expression on page 50 of the joint appendix, of the Mississippi Supreme Court saying that, using a harmless error analysis, really, we likewise are of the opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's verdict would have been the same without, with or without the especially heinous, atrocious, cruel aggravating circumstance."
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1655.332,1656.842,Meeting the Chapman standard?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1656.842,1658.344,I think meeting the Chapman standard.
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.344,1660.947,Did they refer to that?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1660.947,1663.299,"They did not refer to it, but I think--"
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.299,1667.8,"How would we know that it did, because it isn't set forth, is it?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1667.8,1670.493,"--Just the citing, the citing of Chapman?"
1989.88-6873,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.493,1679.047,"Well, the factors are not set forth expressly in the opinion, so how do we know they followed the Chapman--"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1679.047,1683.692,"Other than the fact that they have said beyond a reasonable doubt, you may come to that conclusion."
1989.88-6873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.084,1695.032,--But in your view it is plausible to read this opinion as a harmless error analysis and not as a reweighing analysis?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1695.032,1701.186,"Well, I think... I think that there is not a great deal of difference between harmless error and reweighing."
1989.88-6873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.838,1705.35,"All right, then it is all the more plausible to read the opinion that way, correct?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1705.35,1705.51,--Yes.
1989.88-6873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1705.51,1716.719,"And, if the Mississippi court does not meet the Chapman standard, or if we disagree with the harmless error analysis, then the case has to be reversed, correct?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1716.719,1720.34,Unless... unless there is the reweighing.
1989.88-6873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.861,1727.245,"Well, you just conceded that a plausible way to read the opinion is to say there is no reweighing, that it is just harmless error."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1730.197,1734.591,"--Well, I would have to agree with you there, I guess, in that situation."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.408,1777.698,"May... before you get on, may I... may I ask you one question."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1817.715,1829.543,"--I think that they have, the court has not found the presence of an invalid, or an aggravating circumstance not supported by the evidence, prior to that time."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.543,1830.344,I see.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1830.344,1831.366,But the--
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.366,1836.548,"Then why would they... well then, why would they have said this if there's no precedent for this statement."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1837.717,1853.078,"--No, the... there is a long line of precedent in Mississippi of the court stating that... arguendo saying that the challenge has been made and they say, they address the, make the analysis of saying but even if this was invalid--"
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.078,1853.228,I see.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1856.5,1856.66,"--Yes, right."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.677,1863.187,--I see.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1879.647,1879.837,Right.
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.255,1923.147,"May I then follow up with this question If we put Johnson to one side, because I agree with you, that seems to be inconsistent... and assume this was the sole ground of decision for just a moment, that is not true, there are multiple grounds, but if they had relied on that ground alone, do you think that would be a constitutionally tenable position for the state court to take?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1931.382,1940.939,"--Well, I think that they probably... the analysis that they take there... I mean, they look at it under a, I think, a harmless error or reweighing--"
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.939,1944.301,But they have kind of a per se harmless error analysis is what it amounts to.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1944.301,1949.164,"--Well, that is similar to the one in Clausen on sentencing, I guess, in some regards."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.598,1957.93,Yeah.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1965.474,1966.315,That is right.
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.315,1971.769,"And, unless somebody does the weighing, they aren't following the statute."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1999.207,2001.628,That would be correct there.
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.609,2020.982,"But Zant was about Georgia, wasn't it?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2020.982,2021.152,--Right.
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.152,2022.284,And that is not a weighing state.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2022.284,2022.814,"No, it is not."
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.085,2025.235,Mississippi is.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2025.235,2028.629,"--weighing states... in Florida, where it was a weighing state."
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.585,2048.812,"Well, I suppose in Georgia, the... a rule of law is proffered, if there is one aggravating circumstance, even though there are two others invalidated."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2052.885,2058.259,"--That seems to be right, the way I read Zant, that the court can look at that again--"
1989.88-6873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.259,2060.467,The difference in Mississippi is that it is a weighing state.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2060.467,2061.67,--That is correct.
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.311,2344.034,Can you explain how they can do that reweighing without having any fact-finding power?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2344.034,2348.209,I dispute the fact that--
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.209,2354.162,"I mean, you can't reweigh unless you know what mitigating circumstances there are, and they have no idea what mitigating circumstances the jury found."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2354.162,2361.164,"--Well, I... the first respect of that, I would dispute the fact that the Mississippi Supreme Court has ever said that it cannot."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.919,2397.739,"If they reweigh, isn't that the function you perform when you are doing the sentencing?"
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2401.422,2403.445,"No, they could not have imposed a sentence themselves."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.445,2407.436,And isn't the reweighing necessarily a part of the process of sentencing?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2407.436,2413.511,"I think it is, but that's... the sentence has already imposed."
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.106,2431.984,"I can understand your saying that it is harmless error, after they study it all the way through, but I really am a little, little uncertain... I am not sure I exactly capture your position on what the reweighing process is."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2437.126,2437.497,--Yes.
1989.88-6873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.497,2440.689,"And it isn't a sentencing itself, because they have no power to do that."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2444.312,2448.345,Maybe it is a combination of all of it.
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.508,2510.416,Is it clear that the rebalancing that the Mississippi court made here was a rebalancing without taking into account the heinous and aggravating circumstances factor?
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2510.416,2524.646,"I don't know that it is absolutely clear that they did that, since they did say that, as an alternative ground, that they were applying it, their own limiting construction in finding this... the... that this was a properly submitted thing also--"
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.646,2526.698,That is what I find confusing.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2558.401,2558.651,--Right.
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.651,2561.863,--Then I would think they were balancing without the heinous factor.
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2575.184,2585.721,"Well, I think... I think that those are, maybe a separate analysis."
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.777,2596.63,"But that is not the one remaining aggravating factor that they are balancing, supposedly."
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2596.63,2597.632,No.
1989.88-6873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.032,2598.773,So what relevance--
1989.88-6873,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2598.773,2612.895,"Of course, then they go on, on the next page, talking about the, it is not too great when the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed against each other, and the death penalty will not be wantonly or freakishly imposed."
1989.88-6873,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.323,2670.984,"--Thank you, Mr. White."
1989.88-6873,2,33967,kenneth_s_resnick,,2712.331,2716.985,"Your Honor, there is a history to that, that provision, because that question occurred to me."
1989.88-6873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.583,2905.685,"Thank you, Mr. Resnick."
