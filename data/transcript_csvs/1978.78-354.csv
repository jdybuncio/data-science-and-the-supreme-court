1978.78-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.093,The case is submitted.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,64.748,68.648,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,617.882,622.707,Do you feel the North Carolina rule is rather isolated?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,622.707,623.634,I'm sorry?
1978.78-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.634,629.632,Do you feel the rule enunciated by your Supreme Court is rather isolated among other courts?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,629.632,632.214,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I do."
1978.78-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,632.214,635.4,Why do you think your Court takes that position?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,635.4,648.719,"I can only say, sir, that it -- in the four or five cases that our Court has had this question raised to them, they have strictly interpreted Miranda."
1978.78-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,667.2,669.955,Do you think they're throwing the ball of Miranda back here?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,675.234,682.587,"We -- Mr. Justice Blackmun, we are here, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.34,818.514,"Well, that's not the test of Miranda, is it?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,818.514,820.471,Sir?
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.471,832.81,"The test under Miranda is not whether the free will of the witness was overborne but, rather, whether the Miranda warnings were given and that's it."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,832.81,835.063,That's -- that is the position --
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.063,837.334,Miranda is not a voluntariness test.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,837.334,838.607,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.082,845.002,"Well, isn't it that -- what Miranda said and --"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,845.002,846.132,"That's what Miranda said, yes."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.132,852.128,What this Court has done in every case that has followed Miranda?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,852.128,852.957,"That's correct, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,905.084,918.545,I think that the respondents would take the position that the respondent doesn't mind to appraise his own position quietly and to himself but not before public office.
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,918.545,920.572,Without help from the prosecution.
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.572,924.532,And without help from the prosecution.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,933.618,933.663,I think --
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,933.663,935.083,You keep saying that.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,935.083,935.701,I think that any --
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,935.701,942.689,He was under detention in the FBI headquarters and he thinks out loud.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,944.659,945.615,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,945.615,946.523,"But, I misunderstood you to say --"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,946.523,947.274,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.219,949.66,I'm sorry.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,950.687,953.767,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.491,981.665,"Mr. Chalmers, I did understand you to be arguing that the rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court follows deprives the suspect of the opportunity to act intelligently in his own way."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,983.258,983.816,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.898,1013.195,That's right.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1013.195,1033.886,"Disregarding entirely any circumstance, any gesture, any words that the defendant uses to give to the trial judge at the trial level sufficient facts to find out exactly what --"
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.886,1042.944,Doesn't the rule that North Carolina Court follows have the advantage of a little more certainty than the finder of fact trying to interpret ambiguous conduct?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1042.944,1043.444,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.406,1095.139,And what would be wrong with that to be darn sure about what he intends to do?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1095.139,1097.975,Would that solve the question?
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.975,1099.793,"Sure, if the answer is yes, the issue is answered."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1099.793,1110.84,"Alright, sir, and, suppose, sir, the defendant at that time makes no statement but continues on talking?"
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.84,1113.732,"Well, suppose he talks before he gets the Miranda warnings at all."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1124.072,1124.639,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.639,1128.119,"And you know you can't commence, at least until you read him the form."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1128.119,1128.808,That's correct.
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.808,1135.2,"And the question is can you convince -- can you commence before he answers unequivocally, “I'm prepared to talk.”"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1135.2,1136.44,"Well, we say that --"
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.44,1142.601,"You say, “Yes, well, if we just kind of leave a little ambiguous, we'll take our chances on what the trial judge will find.”"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1142.601,1142.69,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.69,1150.192,"And if you require him unequivocally to say how he feels, well then, isn't it -- don't you remove one issue from the trials that follow?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1150.192,1157.631,"Yes, sir, except you are adding to the litany of Miranda and making --"
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1157.631,1159.824,But for the very reason that you have the Miranda warning.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1163.974,1164.511,That's correct.
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.117,1178.109,"And shouldn't there be a question in your mind when he says, “No, I won't sign the form”?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1178.109,1183.001,"No, sir, there's no question in my mind about that."
1978.78-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.001,1195.964,I suppose in your guilty plea cases where you have a set of things that the trial judge has to read to the person who's pleading guilty as to what he's giving up.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1211.746,1235.719,"No, sir, that -- and we face that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in North Carolina with respect to post conviction hearings and also habeas corpus hearings where the long line of questions asked of a defendant are repudiated at a later date in denying it."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.722,1258.542,"No, but you really don't have a problem if he signs the form, do you?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1258.542,1258.83,Not under--
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.83,1262.224,Isn't it standard practice to try and get him to sign the form.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1262.224,1262.58,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.403,1265.042,But it did here.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1265.042,1277.587,"We're dealing -- in the facts in this case, we're dealing with an FBI agent, a highly trained sophisticated law enforcement agent, and I can't say that --"
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.587,1280.974,"On the one side of the conversation, a highly sophisticated law enforcement agent."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1281.997,1282.549,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.453,1287.452,If he was unable to get him to sign a form saying that --
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1287.452,1287.775,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.959,1295.594,"Well, he asked him to, didn't he?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1295.594,1298.177,He handed him the form and asked him what he signed.
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.177,1298.835,Yes.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1298.835,1308.492,"Yes, sir, but I don't think, and I don't -- in fact, I'm certain that there's no -- there's nothing in the record or any other allegation about that then."
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1388.588,1391.229,That's what the FBI regulation says.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1391.229,1392.09,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1392.09,1392.583,To its agent?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1392.583,1403.693,"Yes, sir, and, Mr. Justice Marshall, let me say to you that we in law enforcement have no problem living with Miranda."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.723,1567.552,"Mr. Chalmers, you've said -- you repeated what you said earlier that each one of the Federal Circuits has expressed disagreement with North Carolina's rule."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1567.552,1568.033,"That's correct, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1568.033,1570.301,"At the time of your petition, I think it was 10 of the 11 circuits."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1570.301,1575.761,"At the time of our petition, we could not and did not find the Sixth Circuit."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.477,1589.862,I see.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1595.571,1604.886,"I believe that, in our petition for cert and in our brief, we stated that there were 20."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.886,1605.487,20?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1605.487,1606.001,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1606.001,1607.858,And are they identified in your brief?
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1607.858,1608.37,"Yes, sir, they are."
1978.78-354,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.37,1609.859,"Alright, thank you."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.696,1615.84,"Mr. Chalmers, before the Miranda case was decided, how many states had adopted the rule of the Miranda case?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1617.946,1622.829,Before Miranda was announced by Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice Warren?
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.829,1627.287,Yes.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1627.287,1644.316,"Mr. Justice Stevens, if you pardon a personal observation, I've been in the prosecution business for 25 years and I am not past let any -- (Voice Overlap) that any law enforcement agency outside the Federal Bureau of Investigation --"
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1644.316,1645.986,The FBI had won.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1653.261,1655.972,"As I say, pre-Miranda, I don't --"
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1655.972,1677.349,"No, in the same time the Miranda case was argued, the United States against Jackson was argued because a federal case and the one the two chapters were on referred to the FBI warning regulation was put in the Jackson case."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1677.349,1677.474,That contention --
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.474,1680.571,And it had been used by the FBI for many years.
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1680.571,1682.006,"Yes, sir, but --"
1978.78-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.006,1682.658,Many years.
1978.78-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.658,1687.914,"Hadn't you just told us, Mr. Chalmers, that the FBI had followed this practice before Miranda?"
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1687.914,1688.599,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.599,1689.338,But my point is that --
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1689.338,1691.666,"Yes, sir, I was -- to answer his question --"
1978.78-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.666,1694.547,"The state had not followed it, but the FBI had followed it."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1694.547,1703.288,"The FBI had the policy pre-Miranda, as appears on page 483-486, I believe, of Miranda."
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.288,1707.188,"But pre-Miranda, neither -- no state had it nor any Court of Appeals."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1707.188,1707.341,I --
1978.78-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.341,1709.805,"But, now, at least they've got North Carolina on this rule."
1978.78-354,0,34285,lester_v_chalmers_jr,,1717.578,1721.034,"I cannot take exception to that, sir."
1978.78-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1726.299,1728.931,Mr. Braswell.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1728.931,1733.118,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1775.115,1780.114,What's the significance that you attach to the hour of the day?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1780.114,1788.208,Because I say that is understandingly intelligently and knowingly waived any rights that he may have.
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.084,1800.163,"But how does that -- what -- that doesn't relate to six o'clock in the morning as it might at 2 o'clock in the morning in that sense, does it?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1800.163,1804.442,"Well, I think it does, depending upon -- it said that he was very quiet."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.011,1960.95,Exercise what rights?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1960.95,1974.759,"That -- to remain silent, not make any statement, or that he wants a counsel, or, words of that time, he states or he makes a statement, “I'm not going to sign anything.I will not sign the form.”"
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.027,1987.951,"But Mr. Braswell, there wasn't any signed statement involved in Miranda, was there?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1987.951,1989.882,"No, sir, there was not, Justice Marshall."
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.882,1994.202,"Well, where do you put all this on the signed statement and put it on Miranda?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,1994.202,2002.805,I think the interrogator set the tone of the interrogation.
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.182,2047.328,My only point is why the answer is on him not signing that.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2047.328,2049.885,"Because that's what the officer gave to him, Justice Marshall."
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.167,2069.643,Do you -- do you contend that he didn't understand what was printed on the material handed to him?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2069.643,2073.005,"I say the record is silent from that, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2075.911,2079.223,The record does show that he said he had an 11th Grade education.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2079.223,2081.244,"Right, he nodded his head, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.326,2102.204,"Normally, there's a presumption that somebody who's gone through 11 years of schooling knows how to read and right."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2102.204,2115.231,"I grant you that, sir, but at -- I'm saying that at this particular case that this man here did not ever acknowledged that he understood everything about it, except to say, “I will not sign anything.”"
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.231,2120.077,Doesn't the record also indicate that he was orally advised of his rights under the Miranda case?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2120.077,2121.76,"Sir, earlier, and he exercised --"
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.76,2123.576,"Now, there's no indication that he was deaf, is there?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2123.576,2124.355,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.299,2130.719,He exercised what?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2130.719,2132.822,He exercised his right to remain silent.
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.822,2133.822,"No, he talked."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2134.243,2134.519,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2134.519,2136.765,He expressed his willingness to talk and then he talked.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2136.765,2139.587,He did not talk after the oral advisory.
1978.78-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.023,2158.912,Mr. Braswell --
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.912,2162.725,Isn't that correct that he's not required to sign?
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2164.572,2166.7,Not in North Carolina.
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.7,2167.378,In the--
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2167.378,2168.504,I think you --
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2168.504,2172.064,"In Miranda -- under Miranda, is there any requirement that --"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2172.064,2172.619,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.588,2175.356,North Carolina has held that there is --
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2175.356,2175.551,Sir?
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2175.551,2176.787,-- in this case.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2177.897,2179.687,"North Carolina has now, what --"
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.687,2182.696,It has read Miranda to require an explicit waiver.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2182.696,2184.048,Expressed waiver.
1978.78-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.048,2184.102,Not necessarily in --
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2184.102,2189.415,"Either orally or written, not necessarily written but one of the other."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.555,2191.757,"Explicit, never implicit."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2191.757,2191.853,I've cited --
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.853,2196.621,Let me go back to my original question which has nothing to do with what North Carolina thinks about it.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2206.946,2208.544,"No, sir, there is nothing."
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2208.544,2210.864,That's all my question is about.
1978.78-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.864,2213.303,"Mr. Braswell, just so I have the sequence correct."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2222.105,2222.646,That's correct.
1978.78-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.646,2226.504,And then after he got to the -- and there was no confession after the oral advise.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2232.545,2233.618,Nothing.
1978.78-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.022,2341.742,But that wasn't the basis on which the Supreme Court of North Carolina excluded the test.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2341.742,2342.514,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2345.804,2360.843,"Right and, Mr. Braswell, the opinion of the Supreme Court of North Carolina which decided this case in your favor seems to be inconsistent in its statement of the facts with the answer you just gave to my Brother Stevens."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2405.385,2405.75,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.197,2413.231,"Yes, he was arrested and advised of his Miranda rights."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2419.319,2419.96,Well --
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.96,2422.395,That's what the North Carolina Supreme Court said.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2422.395,2424.182,"No, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.169,2446.218,Could you show me the -- where in the appendix?
1978.78-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.218,2447.596,On the top of 825.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2454.689,2468.135,"Okay, so page 85, starting with the first paragraph, “During the trip and I gave him a prov -- his advice of rights form in the room.”"
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2468.135,2470.823,"Well, there's no question that he did give him the advice of rights form."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2470.823,2471.719,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2471.719,2473.675,The question is that he orally advised him before that.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2473.675,2474.069,"Alright, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2502.693,2508.012,"So, the statement in the opinion of the North Carolina Supreme Court, you think, is erroneous."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2508.012,2509.102,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.102,2511.016,"Well, this is ambiguous."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2513.755,2514.5,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2514.5,2515.745,Mr. Braswell.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2515.745,2515.925,Sir?
1978.78-354,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2515.925,2518.875,Let me be sure as to what you're saying.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2531.062,2538.645,I disagree in as much as if it says that he was given them orally back in New Rochelle office.
1978.78-354,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2538.645,2548.086,"Because the -- what I've just read is from the petitioner's brief and, in your brief, you say that you rely on the statement of the case as set forth in the petitioner's brief --"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2548.086,2548.294,Yes.
1978.78-354,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2548.294,2552.284,With one exception which is not relevant to what I'm asking.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2552.284,2553.904,Right.
1978.78-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.606,2568.546,Oversight on whose part?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2568.546,2578.368,"An oversight at the time that the Court read that that we all took it from that as Mr. Justice Stewart did at that time, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.237,2599.818,"Well, you didn't cross-petition for a review of the findings of fact of the Supreme Court of North Carolina."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2599.818,2602.459,"No, sir, I did not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.459,2614.923,And is there any controversy about whether or not your client was asked if he understood his rights after reading the form and his reply that he did?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2614.923,2623.513,"Again, Mr. Justice Stewart, there appears that he indicated by nodding his head and that he said he did."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.513,2626.515,"Again, I'm just reading from the opinion of the Court of Appeals of North Carolina."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2626.515,2627.477,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.477,2627.679,"Which, as I say --"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2627.679,2627.995,Right.
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.995,2628.815,Decided in your favor.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2632.783,2635.341,"Not as this case relates, no, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.076,2657.572,"Well, do you -- does the question here make -- does the question you think is here, is it affected by whether or not he was advised orally a second time at the stationhouse?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2657.572,2658.868,"I think it does, yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.868,2660.535,But why is that?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2660.535,2663.054,"Because he said, “I will not sign anything."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.789,2678.97,"Yes, but what if he -- would the situation be different if the agent had orally advised him of his rights at the stationhouse?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2678.97,2680.368,"I believe it would have, yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.368,2681.343,Why is that?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2681.343,2688.388,"Well, on the occasion when he was orally advised of his rights, he made no statement."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.138,2702.556,"Well, I know, but are you suggesting that he did understand his rights from the paper, you say?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2708.583,2709.408,Right.
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.408,2712.437,"So, you think he was twice given his rights."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2712.437,2712.761,They could give him --
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.761,2715.644,"Twice advised of his rights, once in orally and once in writing."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2715.644,2715.795,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.795,2716.043,He understood it.
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.043,2718.429,And that he understood them both times?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2718.429,2720.471,"That is what he indicated, yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.471,2722.572,And you don't disagree with that.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2722.572,2727.272,"Well, I'm saying that is the agent's assumption of what he said."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.272,2729.436,And you don't disagree with that he was given his rights to --
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2729.436,2733.755,"No, sir, I do not disagree that he was orally given them, that he was writtenly given at the station."
1978.78-354,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.755,2736.875,Or that he understood them both times.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2736.875,2743.31,"I would disagree as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence to show that he understood them, yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2743.31,2751.625,"And how about -- is there any controversy over the fact that he said, “I will talk to you”?"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2751.625,2752.544,“I will talk to you?”
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2753.658,2755.101,You accept that as one of the findings?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2755.101,2760.792,"I will -- I accept that he said that after the agent made the statement to him, yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.792,2761.127,And after the --
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2761.127,2761.71,“It is not mandatory.”
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.71,2766.773,And after -- and after at least one oral and one written statement --
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2766.773,2767.067,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.067,2767.695,Advise of his rights.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2767.695,2768.184,Right.
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2774.138,2776.153,"And then he said, “I will talk to you.”"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2776.153,2777.817,"He said, “I will talk to you, but I won't sign anything.”"
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.817,2779.306,“I'm not signing any form.”
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2779.306,2781.503,Right.
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.503,2788.958,You are saying in fact that refusal to sign repudiates any kind of consent.
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2788.958,2790.943,I'm saying it should've stopped right there.
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2814.433,2818.537,"Wouldn't you decide to find if the agent asked him, “Do you waive your rights?”"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2818.537,2819.509,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.629,2820.849,Would that satisfy you?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2820.849,2829.551,"If he had have said to him and he had got an oral answer, “Yes, sir,” if he had said “Do you waive these rights?”"
1978.78-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2829.551,2830.946,That -- that'd be alright?
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.946,2831.072,"Well, --"
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2831.072,2831.169,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-354,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2831.169,2837.58,"-- probably, with today's education as you explain it to us, he wouldn't know what the word “waive” meant."
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2837.58,2839.624,"That's a very good point, Justice Stewart."
1978.78-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2852.097,2855.901,This man or some other people?
1978.78-354,1,38723,r_gene_braswell,,2855.901,2859.66,"I can't say for this man, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-354,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2859.66,2862.184,Does the record show how old he was?
