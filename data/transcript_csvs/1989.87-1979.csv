1989.87-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.343,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1979, Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company against Nancy J. Schwalb, and No. 88-127, Norfolk & Western Railroad Company v. Robert T. Goode."
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,22.235,22.956,Thank you.
1989.87-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.262,548.646,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Prince."
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,569.049,570.118,Thank you.
1989.87-1979,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,645.538,649.081,This is not the test that you are presenting?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,649.081,650.051,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.199,691.563,"An integral part of what, Mr. Prince?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,691.563,696.034,An integral part of the loading operation... of the longshoring.
1989.87-1979,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,708.115,713.589,"This would be so even though, parttime, he swept out the office?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,713.589,716.3,"Even if, parttime, they swept out the office."
1989.87-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,727.719,735.105,"Even though, in this instance, it were limited to cleaning the... the fallen coal?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,737.165,742.881,"If it was limited to cleaning out the fallen coal, because it was a... it was--"
1989.87-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.881,744.632,--That would be enough to bring them within coverage?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,744.632,766.897,"--That would be enough, because it was a factual finding that, if that coal was not cleaned out from under the conveyer belts, the conveyer belts would be damaged and would interfere with the loading so it was essential to get that coal cleaned, and therefore, those employees are involved in the longshoring operations."
1989.87-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.897,768.096,And this was all they did?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,768.096,771.618,"No, that was not all they did, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.618,772.839,What else did they do?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,772.839,793.174,"One of the other employees... well, they... one of the employees at the time of injury... and of course the time of injury is not the test, but one of the employees, Mrs. Schwalb, at the time of injury, was cleaning out coal from the trunnion rollers, which was necessary to allow the dumpers to operate."
1989.87-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.174,793.485,Sure.
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,802.501,807.956,They did some amount of cleaning of bathrooms and of offices.
1989.87-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.956,814.3,But the injury was... all of them were in the process of performing their loading duties?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,814.3,815.542,"That... that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,815.542,822.557,Did they do any repair work on damaged equipment or anything?
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,822.557,829.633,"Not Schwalb and McGlone, but the third employee, Robert Goode, actually worked up on the dumper."
1989.87-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,874.906,883.982,"Incidentally, did any of the three employees bring a... a Federal Employer Liability Act suit?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,883.982,885.184,"Your Honor, they all brought one."
1989.87-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.896,909.101,"Whereas damages, I gather, under the FELA are likely to be greater than the compensation under the Longshore Act?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,909.101,910.592,They would most likely be greater.
1989.87-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,916.645,928.644,"Mr. Prince, the limits of this so-called functional relationship test that you propose aren't entirely clear."
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,937.989,940.321,"That is true, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.321,954.32,"It has... the test you propose has the disadvantage of forcing the courts, in a case-by-case basis, to determine how essential and how integral the work is to the loading process."
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,954.32,958.914,"Your Honor, I don't... I don't think it's going to be a test of how essential."
1989.87-1979,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1014.142,1016.325,What about a machinist--
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,1016.325,1016.545,"So I don't think, Your Honor--"
1989.87-1979,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.545,1032.786,"--Mr. Prince, what about a machinist who... who works for the railroad only in downtown Norfolk who... who repairs, among other things, one of these trunnions that's essential for the movement of coal?"
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,1032.786,1045.776,"Under the rulings of the Pfeiffer and Caputo, if he spends part of his time in repairing ship-loading equipment, he would be covered all the time."
1989.87-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.776,1049.239,"Yes, but this is... it would not satisfy the situs requirement."
1989.87-1979,0,45886,william_t_prince,,1049.239,1053.542,"--He wouldn't... oh, I beg your pardon."
1989.87-1979,1,19196,christine_a_desan_husson,,1203.836,1205.896,Desan-Husson.
1989.87-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.896,1207.038,Desan-Husson.
1989.87-1979,1,19196,christine_a_desan_husson,,1208.67,1215.163,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1363.479,1372.412,What about the problem of the occasional visit to the situs and the injury occurring there?
1989.87-1979,1,19196,christine_a_desan_husson,,1372.412,1376.917,It would depend on how often the worker was on the situs.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,1840.491,1843.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.757,2024.495,"On your approach, then, would any of the railroad's employees engaged in this operation be covered by the Longshoreman's Act?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2024.495,2027.606,Not those that were engaged in these functions here.
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.817,2030.969,That isn't what I asked you.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2041.657,2044.108,"--Your Honor, it depends on where you draw the line."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.141,2065.402,"He unloaded it into a ship, didn't he?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2065.402,2085.117,"Well, he unloaded it onto a system of conveyer belts, which we would suggest, and we argued in our brief, that those conveyer belts, once the coal is unloaded onto the belt, they could take the coal to a power plant or a steel mill or any other type of facility that uses a lot of coal."
1989.87-1979,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.117,2086.585,But they weren't doing it here.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2089.777,2091.159,Eventually it got to a ship.
1989.87-1979,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.63,2093.163,It wasn't eventually; it was the next stop.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2095.817,2106.052,"It had to go through a system, sir, where it... the direction of the coal actually changed, and up until that time it's our position that he could have been involved in just merely unloading a railroad car."
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.052,2109.786,"Of course, you could say the same thing about the people that were operating the conveyer belt, too."
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2116.781,2120.484,"Again, it depends on where the conveyer belt is located and where the--"
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.484,2121.594,"Well, we know where it was located."
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2134.504,2140.337,"--It goes to the question of what is the situs, what is the location here, which is part of the statute."
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.337,2140.477,Right.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2144.732,2148.495,I would have to maintain the same thing.
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.057,2154.061,So that leaves you nobody.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2157.812,2160.455,"Well, originally, that's what the act said."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.779,2182.511,"Does it just turn on who employed them, or not?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2182.511,2184.863,"If it did, we wouldn't be here."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.367,2192.8,So you're saying none of the railroad employees moving this coal to the ship would be covered by the Longshoreman's Act?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2192.8,2193.21,"No, sir."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.942,2197.314,Tell me one that would be covered.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2197.314,2205.219,"--Well, if for example... and I know there's a... there's a federal case law, the Harmon case."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.108,2225.444,"Wasn't this movement from... from the railroad car to the ship continuous, when the conveyer belt ran from the car to the ship?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2225.444,2229.405,It did in the sense that it went--
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.405,2230.046,It didn't stop anywhere.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2230.637,2231.969,"--That's right, but it--"
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.969,2235.792,It's sort of like that chute that you just mentioned.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2235.792,2241.854,"--Well, if you follow that, if it... the railroad then could make the same argument, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.309,2265.491,"Well, I suppose then... suppose the railroad said we don't want to do this with our own employees."
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2281.586,2284.798,"Your Honor, my understanding is that, in fact, is what's happened."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.89,2290.123,Would they... would they be covered under the Longshoremen's Act?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2290.123,2292.285,"Again, you have to focus on what they're doing."
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.315,2294.456,I know.
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2314.77,2323.827,--They would be covered from the point that it's actually being loaded onto the ships.
1989.87-1979,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.904,2338.609,"Well then, if you have doubts about that, why, I don't know why you don't have the same doubts about the railroad employees."
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2351.747,2366.406,"I understand your question, Your Honor, and it depends... for example, in Robert Goode's case you would have to examine what those individuals were working on at the time."
1989.87-1979,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2405.586,2423.709,"Mr. Wilcox, do you recognize that most of the federal courts considering these questions have adopted the test that the Solicitor General's Office suggests, rather than the one adopted by the Supreme Court of Virginia?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2423.709,2443.363,"That's true to some extent, but I believe that if the Court reviews the cases... for example, in the Dravo case, which is a 3rd Circuit case, it's very similar to the situation for McGlone and Schwalb."
1989.87-1979,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.311,2515.784,"Well, Perini had language in it rejecting the test adopted by the Virginia Supreme Court, didn't it?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2515.784,2541.733,"It may have, but it did review the purposes of expansion, or the amendments, and as Your Honor well recalls, having written the opinion, the purposes were to expand coverage, to extend it to longshoring workers and it recognized the changing nature of the industry."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.388,2640.419,Are you suggesting that its optional?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2640.419,2644.383,"--No, I'm not suggesting that it's optional."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.383,2648.116,"Well, why is that relevant, that none of them filed claims?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2648.116,2664.788,"Well, because if the purpose for amending the act was to improve their benefits, these workers here, these railroad workers, all... already have a perfectly suitable source of compensation through the Federal Employers Liability Act."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.991,2693.218,"So, we should disregard the language of the statute and go back and see whether the sponsors, or so to speak, the lobbyists, have this in mind?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2693.218,2712.571,"Well, as... as the Court's well aware by the questions here this afternoon, the question of coverage and who it applies to and who it doesn't apply to is... provokes lots of questions, and we would suggest that the intent of the Congress was to expand the coverage to benefit workers."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.702,2733.298,How about the fellow you spoke about who was actually pouring coal into the hold of the ship and was a rail... railroad worker?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2738.062,2750.621,"--Yes sir, I did, and if you look at what he's actually doing at the time he's hurt, he's loading a ship, and that's... fits within the definition of the status test."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.621,2756.434,"So all railroad workers aren't excluded, even though any of them could sue under the FELA?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2756.434,2773.045,"Yes sir, that's correct, and the Court here this afternoon could make a policy decision that there's already an act sufficient and adequate for railroad workers and rule as... draw an arbitrary bright line as to who the act applies to and who it doesn't apply to."
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.045,2777.148,We... we can make that policy decision?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2779.461,2780.11,"Yes, sir."
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.936,2792.858,"You're not suggesting we repeat that, are you?"
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2792.858,2793.509,"No, I'm not."
1989.87-1979,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.582,2834.387,"Mr. Wilcox, we're dealing with a statute that feels it necessary to specifically except from the term ""employee"" under the act, individuals who are, one, employed by suppliers, transporters or vendors; two, are temporarily doing business; and, three, are not engaged in work normally performed by employees of that employer under this chapter, and... and a lot of other specific exceptions, which would be unnecessary if your interpretation of the act were the interpretation that Congress accepted and intended."
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2850.743,2862.988,"Although we didn't... sir, we didn't mention in our brief, but if you look at the specific language in the act in 33 U.S.C.A. Section 902(3), which contains what an employee's--"
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2862.988,2863.919,What page?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2865.9,2868.994,--I'm... from the joint appendix on page 47.
1989.87-1979,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.994,2870.016,What page?
1989.87-1979,2,18161,bruce_a_wilcox,,2870.016,2871.518,"47, Your Honor."
1989.87-1979,3,45886,william_t_prince,,3544.834,3554.261,I would like to respond to Justice Stevens as to why not... Congress may not have excluded people who repair and maintain equipment.
1989.87-1979,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3589.475,3595.961,"But the difference, I suppose, is they were engaged in work that one could say was part of the loading or unloading operation, as opposed to people that--"
1989.87-1979,3,45886,william_t_prince,,3595.961,3598.712,--This Court said they were involved in intermediate steps.
1989.87-1979,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3598.712,3599.99,--In the loading operation.
1989.87-1979,3,45886,william_t_prince,,3599.99,3602.792,In the loading or unloading operation.
1989.87-1979,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3602.792,3610.559,"But I... I'm not suggesting it's necessarily right, but one could... could draw a distinction between that kind of work and merely repairing or maintaining equipment."
1989.87-1979,3,45886,william_t_prince,,3610.559,3614.67,The... all the circuits have held that.
1989.87-1979,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3614.67,3614.96,I know that.
1989.87-1979,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3615.981,3617.664,"Thank you, Mr. Prince."
