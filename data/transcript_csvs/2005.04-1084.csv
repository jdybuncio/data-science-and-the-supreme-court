2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.914,We'll hear argument next in Gonzales versus O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.824,13.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.834,58.544,May I address a preliminary inquiry that I have?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,67.024,68.302,"Yes, a preliminary injunction."
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.302,74.922,"And we have to find that, for the trial court to have issued it, it was an abuse of discretion?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,74.922,80.975,"Well, with respect to certain aspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes."
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.963,88.129,You know--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,88.129,88.513,But--
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,88.513,99.881,"--the court found evidence in equipoise and so on and so forth, so I just wondered, at the bottom line, what our legal standard is here."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,99.881,100.409,--Yes.
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.452,107.88,Abused its discretion.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,107.88,113.339,"--Well, abused... a court always abuses its discretion if it... if it commits a legal error."
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,116.01,128.616,It seems to me your position is that you must... we must give controlling determinative weight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,155.415,156.231,Well--
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,156.231,156.675,The--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,156.675,163.068,"--first of all, our principal submission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is sufficient unto itself."
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.335,239.029,Mr. Kneedler--
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.029,246.81,"--Well, but part of the statute is Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we have to apply to its acts here."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,246.81,247.393,--Right.
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.626,266.026,--Mr.--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,266.026,266.376,--exemptions.
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.376,279.5,"--Mr. Kneedler, I think everyone would concede that there is a compelling interest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled Substances Act on that level, yes."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,327.207,333.428,"Well, the argument is not that the Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA."
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.328,376.437,I would understand that if the Government had acted uniformly.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,392.899,401.147,"In the peyote exception, Congress was acting under its distinct constitutionally recognized authority with respect to Indian tribes."
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.256,407.006,It's--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,407.006,407.434,--as--
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.434,424.062,"--But it still shows... whatever power they were... they were proceeding under, it still shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able to use a substance banned by category 1."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,425.239,425.656,"--Well, I--"
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.656,430.966,"--whatever power it was under, it's a demonstration that you can make an exception without the sky falling."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,430.966,440.868,"--Well, I, in no way, think that Congress believed that by enacting the special provision for Indian tribes, it was thereby opening the Controlled Substances Act to individualized--"
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.868,441.151,Well--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,441.151,441.951,--religious exceptions.
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,441.951,443.379,--maybe Congress didn't assume that.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,447.077,475.636,"Well, I think what's wrong with the argument is that what Congress did with respect to Indian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and conclude that, for a variety of reasons... and, particularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an independent Indian tribe to control its internal affairs this exception applies only to members of recognized Indian tribes... that, in that context, balancing all of the relevant considerations... not the sort of balance under RFRA--"
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,475.636,476.246,But it--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,476.246,479.928,"--but balancing all the considerations under the... its Indian power, concluded there was--"
2005.04-1084,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.928,486.815,"But Justice Scalia's point is, no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,497.818,503.194,"--But that was... that was a specific judgment made by Congress itself, looking at--"
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.194,503.877,"But, Mr. Kneedler, may I--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,503.877,503.96,--all the factors.
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.96,504.577,--may I stop you--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,504.577,504.86,Yes.
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.86,505.243,--there?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,517.839,532.802,"That... that's correct, but that was understood at the... at... back in 1970, or back, actually, in '65, when that was first adopted, to have been consistent with Congress's original intent in passing the statute, and the Controlled Substances Act, which carried forward the schedules."
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.231,566.486,"But if you take it that the Government was right... before Congress passed the law, the Government was right to give the exemption to allow that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later than Congress's is saying,"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,578.582,578.932,"Yes, and--"
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,578.932,579.843,--congressional statute.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,579.843,591.429,"--the statute actually, you know, now gives some firm statutory basis for that exception, which may not really have existed so comfortably after this Court's decision in Smith."
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.516,612.75,"--Yes, but--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,612.75,612.833,--an exception--
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.833,615.094,--isn't that exactly the... what the Act does?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,615.538,615.954,--No--
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,615.954,617.032,--why they passed it.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,617.032,618.292,--With all respect--
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.292,620.736,"And that's why we came out the other way in Smith, by the way."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,620.736,621.502,--But--
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.692,635.326,"Well, it didn't--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,635.326,636.036,--Substances Act--
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,636.036,636.864,"--say that, did it?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,653.076,666.189,"--But it... but that was the test that the Court was applying, as Congress understood it, prior to Smith, in which, I repeat, the Court said there were certain statutes that categorical judgments could be made about."
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.57,674.42,I want you--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,674.42,674.931,--where the Court--
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.931,679.796,"--to stay on this point, because it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2 substance, would your argument be the same?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,679.796,697.085,"--Our argument would be the same, but for an additional reason there, and that is that even where Congress has... or even where a substance may be distributed and used, it is only for medical purposes, which is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the health and safety purposes of the statute."
2005.04-1084,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.525,730.053,But suppose we--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,730.053,730.469,--in Raich.
2005.04-1084,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.469,734.468,--I grant you that administrative considerations are relevant.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,753.035,768.664,"Well, if I could go back to the way the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on individualized determinations made by individual Federal District Courts making their own judgment about how serious the risk is."
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.565,798.849,But--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,798.849,800.327,--that something may be so.
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.327,802.088,--RFRA overrides all that.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,802.088,802.448,No.
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.898,823.769,"I understand RFRA to be... to say there can be an exception to all Federal statutes where someone makes a religious objection to compliance and, in the judgment of the court, there's not a compelling State interest in the Government going ahead with the statute."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,830.656,853.255,"--We're not saying it's not subject to the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling interest applies under the statute... just as under the First Amendment itself, before RFRA was passed, and the one is to replicate the other... the court... there were certain statutes, when the court looked at the way they operated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the court said that individualized exceptions would not be feasible."
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,857.287,858.437,"Well, when you talk about--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,858.437,859.764,--that Congress meant to put that to one side.
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.764,864.258,"--reasons to believe and disbelieve, we don't have to make a once and for all determination, do we?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,893.215,895.003,I have several responses to that.
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.905,926.305,But that--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,926.305,931.032,--that would be... but that would... that... the... a court would be in a judgment about... in saying that that--
2005.04-1084,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.032,932.043,--Couldn't have said it better.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,941.884,944.906,"--No, what... it did not seek, under the judgment in Smith."
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.436,975.624,But your... but your approach is totally categorical.
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,990.175,990.586,Our--
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,990.586,993.957,"--even applying RFRA, which sets forth a compelling interest test."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,993.957,996.212,--our principal position would be the same.
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1015.112,1017.467,"But Congress disagreed, ultimately."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1019.661,1021.499,And that's an important point.
2005.04-1084,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1028.801,1029.152,It makes--
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.152,1029.652,Mr. Kneedler--
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1029.652,1029.902,"No, but in--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1029.902,1030.579,--a specialized judgment.
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.579,1051.24,"--may Congress, consistent with the Establishment Clause, say that we will create an exception for peyote, but not for this other church, which has far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been found to be a genuine religion?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1073.111,1084.213,"Well, we think that... we think that's critical, because what... just as in this Court's decision in Laurel, what Congress has done is to act to respect the autonomous, independent institutions of the tribe."
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1113.948,1118.297,--May I... may I ask you one question about the procedural posture of this case?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1155.269,1155.653,"--Well, I--"
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.653,1156.43,--you've been debating?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.43,1174.236,"--I... on that limited point, if the Court applied the usual standards for the granting of a preliminary injunction, I think that the Court could quite readily reverse the preliminary injunction here, because that requires a clear showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, plus that the other factors be decided."
2005.04-1084,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.367,1201.467,But they were--
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.467,1201.733,Do--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1201.733,1202.217,--in drugs.
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.217,1202.3,--do your briefs--
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1202.3,1202.767,--Well--
2005.04-1084,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.767,1211.214,"--indicate, or does the record indicate, that the Government was foreclosed from presenting any evidence it wanted to present?"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1221.7,1229.348,"Well, in... as far as our position is concerned on our submission so far, we don't think the Court needs any further evidence."
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1239.85,1243.054,"Counsel, I was a little unclear about your position on the Convention."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1253.291,1253.374,"--No, it--"
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.374,1253.991,--there an independent--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1253.991,1254.074,"--No, it--"
2005.04-1084,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.074,1254.691,--argument?
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1254.691,1264.682,"--No, we believe that complying with an international Convention designed to prohibit trafficking in drugs is, itself, a compelling interest."
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1268.941,1269.608,--How--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1269.608,1270.635,--that would be incorporated in RFRA.
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1282.799,1283.149,"--Well, it--"
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1283.149,1286.248,--by facilitating the importation of drugs from outside the country.
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.248,1291.874,"--Well, what do you... here's the problem that I have, particularly at the stage of the preliminary injunction, with that argument."
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1314.212,1316.223,"No, that exception is--"
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1316.223,1318.827,Let me... let me... let me just finish my... let me get to my... let me get to my question--
2005.04-1084,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1318.827,1319.338,--Sorry.
2005.04-1084,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1319.338,1320.765,--before you answer it.

2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2312.156,2314.51,"Yes, it can, Your Honor."
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.604,2317.115,"So, compliance--"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2317.115,2317.482,--correct.
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.482,2319.97,--with a Treaty is not necessarily a compelling State interest.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2319.97,2320.87,It is not.
2005.04-1084,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.044,2330.805,"But, surely--"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2330.805,2331.122,--the--
2005.04-1084,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2331.122,2338.786,--surely RFRA doesn't say that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in determining what's a compelling interest.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2338.786,2339.452,--No.
2005.04-1084,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.824,2358.186,And getting back to the first question that Justice Breyer asked... and then we got off on what the Treaty really means... but assuming that the Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance... assuming that... is there any evidence that the District Court thought that this was a compelling interest?
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2358.186,2361.041,"--Well, the... no, the District Court--"
2005.04-1084,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.041,2362.485,None at all.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2362.485,2370.793,"--analyzed the Treaty differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to hoasca, for all the reasons that are... that are in his opinion in our brief."
2005.04-1084,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.309,2382.89,"So, if we disagree with you on the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't really even address the point whether or not this and/or the statute, together, can be a compelling interest."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2382.89,2384.65,--That's correct.
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.454,2393.381,I don't know if there isn't a factual question here.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2420.606,2421.206,--That's true.
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.706,2424.044,"And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2448.998,2454.957,"--The response to that, Your Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case."
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.172,2465.875,"Well, it has to be extracted at some point to be... to get into... I'm right here... to get into the tea, right?"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2468.647,2469.991,"--No, Mr. Chief--"
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2469.991,2472.168,"The plants are not... the plants are not imported, right?"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2473.28,2474.44,--The tea is imported.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2474.99,2475.618,Okay.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2475.618,2482.338,"--but the tea is made just like you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and then--"
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2482.338,2482.688,Right.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2482.688,2483.448,--and then you took the leaves out.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.965,2484.692,Right.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2484.692,2488.808,--in that tea is a collection of a tremendous number of alkaloids.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2498.632,2500.41,I guess I... if I could just go back to the point.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2507.031,2507.458,--That--
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2507.458,2513.167,--importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2513.167,2514.578,--That's correct.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.347,2544.514,"So, under your--"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2544.514,2545.174,--of the drug.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2545.174,2548.529,"--theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the Treaty."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2548.529,2549.973,Not by this Treaty.
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2556.926,2560.208,"Yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2567.939,2574.577,"Well, the difference, for example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961 Treaty, it says"
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.586,2624.989,"About commentary or travaux, I don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't contradict the Treaty."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2635.142,2637.086,--Not to my--
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.086,2639.724,"And that's what, it seems to me, is going on here."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2639.724,2678.818,"--No, Your Honor, it's not contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a definition of it, for this litigation only, that is contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by this executive, which means that the executive's position here is really entitled to no deference; because, otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church, the peyote tea, would also be covered."
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.818,2680.328,"But, as... I understand the Treaty."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2689.486,2690.036,That's--
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2690.036,2691.924,"It says DMT> [""]."
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2722.227,2724.515,"Well, except that you don't import the plants, right?"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2724.515,2725.692,--That's correct.
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2736.628,2738.472,"--You're in trouble. That's harder, then, if it's--"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2738.472,2741.093,--It was... it's clear--
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.093,2745.875,"--But, of course, the reason you import it is because it contains this particular substance."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2746.386,2748.38,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.156,2772.523,I don't know what you mean by that.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2773.273,2773.489,Least--
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.489,2773.739,Could you explain that again?
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2776.26,2776.343,To the person.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2777.226,2778.52,--To the aggrieved person.
2005.04-1084,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2780.131,2783.813,--Isn't the compelling interest in enforcing it against the aggrieved person.
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.907,2785.073,Right.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2785.073,2785.657,--That's right.
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.434,2787.517,"Oh, okay."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2787.517,2801.957,"--but RFRA also requires that the Government prove, if it proves a compelling interest, to enforce it against the person, and if it gets there, it also must prove that it is furthering that compelling interest by the least restrictive means."
2005.04-1084,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2802.551,2809.522,"But if the interest is defined, as Mr. Kneedler did... that is, these drugs are ""No, absolutely prohibited""."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2835.819,2838.508,"--Well, I disagree, Your Honor."
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.063,2857.49,What about--
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2857.49,2857.94,And--
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.94,2869.076,"--I worry about the general proposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one narrow exception is not a... doesn't contravene a compelling State interest."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2899.755,2900.766,--Well--
2005.04-1084,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.766,2902.344,At least for now.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2903.188,2906.376,--Until they reproduce.
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.949,2962.842,"May I ask you a question... tangential just a little, but going back to the Chief Justice's question earlier about diversion?"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2978.288,2979.038,Well--
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2979.038,2981.226,"What does the word ""diversion"" mean in this context?"
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2981.226,2983.403,"--""Diversion"", Your Honor, is a term of art here."
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.267,2995.76,"Well, but then, getting more members to... converted to the religion would not be diversion."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,2995.76,2997.104,"--No, it would not be diversion."
2005.04-1084,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.393,3000.993,Okay.
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,3000.993,3003.314,--that there was some diversion outside.
2005.04-1084,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.135,3043.135,"--Yes, but--"

2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,3077.169,3092.603,"Well, the... what the commentary says is that it is not a covered preparation, that an infusion or tea made from the roots of a plant is not a covered preparation, and that--"
2005.04-1084,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3092.603,3097.063,"Ms. Hollander, may I just, on this point... it's the same question I raised with Mr. Kneedler."
2005.04-1084,1,37155,nancy_hollander,,3148.57,3152.852,"--Well, we certainly have a great deal of more evidence, Your Honor, that we can put in."
2005.04-1084,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3279.852,3280.619,"Thank you, Ms. Hollander."

2005.04-1084,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3325.8,3328.322,But what... but what does that benefit you?
2005.04-1084,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3340.418,3343.939,"--Well, I don't think RFRA does override it."
2005.04-1084,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3355.569,3359.651,You think the Treaty gives you a more compelling governmental interest than the Controlled Substances Act?
2005.04-1084,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3359.651,3360.412,--I certainly do.
2005.04-1084,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3369.576,3370.242,More than doubly.
2005.04-1084,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3375.291,3384.532,"--But Congress itself, in the statute implementing this Convention, said it is essential to have international cooperation in the protection of the... of the drugs covered by the statute."
2005.04-1084,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.414,3395.963,"So, we have to agree with you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area have, sort of, a zero tolerance approach to enforcing the Treaty."

2005.04-1084,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3458.889,3459.299,--Well--
