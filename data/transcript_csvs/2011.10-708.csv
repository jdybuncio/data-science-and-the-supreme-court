2011.10-708,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-708, First American Financial Corporation v. Edwards."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,9.106,11.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-708,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,38.458,55.468,"Let me just get -- use an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, really: I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning and try to sell them something, okay?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,77.333,78.65,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,101.949,117.375,"In other words, if the FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of the people it hurts, and there is some kind of automatic recovery, $500 anybody who bought the substance because it wasn't supposed to be sold, and she's one of the 2 percent that it helped--"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,117.375,118.76,"Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-708,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,118.76,119.86,--you can't sue?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,119.86,128.533,"--In the case -- in the case in which someone is exposed to a substance that has -- that is illegal, they might well suffer a harm, and the harm might be the exposure to the substance."
2011.10-708,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,137.372,146.81,"Well, here she was exposed, or the plaintiff was exposed, to the kind of transaction that Congress said was harmful as a general matter, just like the example you gave."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,146.81,147.929,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,162.706,164.089,"But, counsel, going back--"
2011.10-708,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.089,164.906,I'm sorry.
2011.10-708,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.641,180.668,"Because she can't prove it at the early stage, and the problem that Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell until the house is going to be sold in the end how adequate the title insurance was."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,202.564,211.603,"--Your Honor, with respect to unjust enrichment cases, those cases reflect circumstances where there is a benefit received at the expense of the plaintiff."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.225,284.551,"--Counsel, are you taking a very broad position that this is an unusual State, it appears, with three or four others, where the States mandate that title insurance be at a fixed price."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,304.215,305.699,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,315.487,316.022,"No, no."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,336.603,352.195,"--If the -- I want to -- I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question, but if the question is, there were various rates available and the Plaintiff alleges an overcharge, that they purchased a -- a policy and there was a cheaper policy available, and as a result of the violation--"
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.195,362.651,"So you are in fact arguing very broadly that there is no presumption of -- of injury in these cases, that the plaintiff still has to come in and prove--"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,362.651,364.837,--Your -- Your Honor--
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,364.837,369.324,--that in fact they would have gotten a cheaper -- a cheaper policy?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,369.324,375.395,"--Your Honor, the -- the plaintiff would have to allege in the complaint and then eventually show that there was some injury."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,377.095,379.763,Same thing with nominal damages and statutory damages?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,382.299,396.824,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because again the question for purposes of standing, the question for purposes of the ability of a plaintiff to come into court, is to show that they have some injury in fact, that there is some harm, some way in which they were made worse off."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.774,398.926,That's not so extraordinary.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,412.901,413.52,--That's true.
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.805,432.481,"I was going to ask you, along that line, are there any trust cases that -- that Respondents or the government could cite in which a party can go into court alleging that the market has been distorted, even though that person has no damage?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,435.899,444.219,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure -- I did not see any of the cases that they cited involving the trust -- the trust circumstance--"
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.219,444.519,Yes.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,444.519,446.621,--where there was that sort of vague allegation.
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.611,454.411,Right.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,454.411,468.536,"But the trust cases involve a circumstance, the -- I think that the plaintiff here kind of gives the game away by, in the -- when talking about the Michoud case, using the phrase ""the plaintiff may sue"", and of course that's not what the case says."
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.848,491.45,There is not automatic disgorgement in those--
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,491.45,493.152,"--There could be automatic disgorgement, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.555,500.155,"Well, but--"
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,500.155,501.091,"Mr. Panner, I thought--"
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.091,509.78,--let -- let's assume that a trustee acts on its own interest and -- and sells property.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,519.886,527.057,"--Well, the injury to the beneficiary in that circumstance, Your Honor, is that the trustee would have misappropriated an opportunity that belonged to the beneficiary."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,565.867,591.649,"So what more does this plaintiff have to allege other than, if I had been told that this was a prearranged, tied product between the mortgage and the title company, but that I had a right to get an untied product even at the same price, and I would have exercised that right if I had known -- would that be enough?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,591.649,592.767,"That might be enough, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.717,602.14,"Would that be enough in -- in Justice Breyer's example, of someone who says, I received a call at midnight and it bothered me?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,602.14,605.409,"Yes, I think that certainly would be enough, absolutely."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,621.768,632.909,So you go back to your position that Congress has no power to give a cause of action on the basis of a statutory violation in which it is presuming injury?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,632.909,635.511,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,658.46,660.345,"Well, certainly you couldn't -- you couldn't sue."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,669.351,676.255,"--Well, Your Honor, you paid money -- in this case the plaintiff paid money for a title insurance policy which she received."
2011.10-708,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,683.075,684.194,Could I ask you to clarify something?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,692.717,701.655,"--Well, certainly if a plaintiff said that the -- that the manner in which the title insurance was provided had delayed her closing or that there were procedures that were--"
2011.10-708,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,701.655,702.822,"No, what could be done -- okay."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,703.288,716.832,"--that there was something about the service that she received as a result of the -- the referral to a particular title insurer, again, assuming that this is a violation, which we don't -- we don't think it is."
2011.10-708,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,718.332,724.819,So you could -- the plaintiff could allege some kind defective service at the time when the title insurance was purchased?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,727.538,729.39,"--Actually, most--"
2011.10-708,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,729.39,737.662,You get a title insurance policy and that's it; and you don't know whether -- you don't know what will happen if there is some problem alleged with the title at some point down the road.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,737.662,747.101,"--Well, that's really -- the -- the risk of that is really on the title insurer, which is why the title insurer has no incentive whatsoever to encourage poor service by a title insurance agent."
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.101,749.267,"--Well, that -- that leads me to this point."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,807.723,809.342,"Well, Your Honor, that--"
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.342,811.092,"Now, she didn't allege that."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,811.992,818.364,"--She didn't allege it, and I think that's critical, because the -- the issue is not whether it's conceivable that an injury could occur from the violation."
2011.10-708,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.217,866.594,"Suppose Congress makes a finding; this is the finding: We think that lawyers or whoever is engaged in these who hire title insurance companies should hire the best one on the merits, not on the basis of which one will give them the biggest kickback."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,933.489,948.015,"The Constitution, Article III, as this Court has interpreted it, requires that a plaintiff that comes into court must have suffered an injury in fact, and Congress cannot create that injury legislatively."
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,957.604,977.768,"--Mr. Panner, suppose there were a contract between Ms. Edwards and Tower and the contract had a no-kickback clause, not one that suggested that Ms. Edwards had to show any kind of injury, greater cost or lesser service, but just you can't have any kickbacks."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,979.602,1000.615,"Well, if it was a negotiated agreement and it was -- it was one where the parties had given value for that assurance, then that would represent something that there had been a judgment in advance by this particular individual that that was something that was a performance that she was willing to pay for and a promise that meant something to her, and so that would potentially be a different case."
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.615,1007.454,And now suppose that Congress passes a law and says every contract of this kind has to have such a provision in it.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1007.454,1008.521,Right.
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1008.521,1009.454,Would she now have standing?
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1009.454,1012.775,"Most likely not, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.044,1044.827,But it's a different case.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1080.919,1084.471,"Well, I think that Congress could potentially create a trust relationship."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.471,1094.143,"And if it did, would the violation of that trust relationship constitute injury for -- for Article III purposes?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1094.143,1096.179,"Well, it would depend, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.451,1109.169,"We don't require injury in fact for most breaches of trust, do we?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1109.169,1110.788,"--You do, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.26,1155.4,"Well, I understand, but I'm just saying that that concrete interest can be created by Congress instead of being created by contract."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1170.06,1172.179,--I don't -- I don't think the situation would change.
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.96,1205.316,"Mr. Panner, in response to Justice Scalia's questions and my questions, you are suggesting that there is a difference depending on what the source of the law is."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1223.962,1226.647,"I certainly didn't mean to say that, Your Honor, so let me try to clarify."
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1311.669,1313.469,I'm not sure that that's the right understanding of her complaint.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1333.249,1338.337,"Again, I don't think that the trust cases can be fairly read to say that, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1350.811,1371.541,"Suppose she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a well-respected economist that says: Congress was right; these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect on the people who are purchasing title insurance, and goes through all kinds of analyses that show that."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1374.16,1375.862,"--Well, at the pleading stage it might be, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1441.554,1444.256,"Counsel, I'm still having problems."
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.256,1465.753,"Just following up Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with economists and concludes there is a reasonable probability that if there were no kickbacks there would be a more competitive market, there would be lower prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the collateral fees in addition to the title insurance."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1478.693,1486.999,"Well, Your Honor, there has to be a connection between the violation alleged and the harm that ensues, and so a general understanding that--"
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.999,1495.522,"Well, the person alleges: And I was in this market and I might have -- there is a reasonable probability that I could have had a lower price, according to economic theory."
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1495.522,1499.224,"--Well -- well, again, that wasn't alleged here."
2011.10-708,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1499.926,1501.476,I'm assuming it's alleged.
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1501.476,1502.559,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1537.863,1546.267,"If the plaintiff went further and alleged some harm particular to her, wouldn't that be even more speculative, some economic harm particular to her?"
2011.10-708,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1547.885,1548.702,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.426,1562.028,"Thank you, Mr. Panner."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1563.661,1568.465,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.283,1598.068,You speak of a duty of loyalty.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1628.921,1633.491,"--Congress could have made them, the agent, could have, as you pointed out, could have made them a full-fledged fiduciary."
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.479,1640.029,We'd have a different -- we'd have a different case then.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1640.929,1656.69,"--Congress actually elevated one component of that by giving you a right to -- freedom from a particular conflict of interest, and that is the kickbacks that undermine their incentive to serve your best interest, that undermine their incentive to choose the insurer that provides the best quality and the best service."
2011.10-708,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1656.69,1664.594,"Well, this is where I have problems with your argument, because this doesn't seem to me to be a fiduciary relationship and I don't see where the duty of loyalty comes from."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1705.27,1708.389,"Well, you might have an interest in getting an honest opinion."
2011.10-708,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1714.043,1714.293,I know.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1731.754,1741.11,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, Congress is entitled to elevate your interest in obtaining honest judgments or conflict-free advice to legal protection."
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.299,1753.834,"Well, the issue isn't whether they can afford it legal protection."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1769.777,1770.762,Right.
2011.10-708,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.805,1795.095,"Could you tell me, just with Justice Alito's automobile hypothetical, just as a matter of agency law -- I'm a little rusty on this one."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1814.056,1815.991,If they are acting--
2011.10-708,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.991,1818.61,"And he doesn't know, they haven't been informed--"
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1818.61,1826.549,"--If that is an agency duty, and we assume that that's an agent; they are acting as agent for the person with the broken car -- the answer is absolutely, without having to show any loss."
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.024,1841.409,"If I take my car to an auto mechanic, he's not my agent."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1845.76,1847.645,That's exactly why I said--
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.645,1849.997,"And it's not an agency relation here, either."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1855.216,1866.357,--Congress imposed one component of the duty that applies to agents and fiduciaries across the board and that is: Don't take kickbacks that undermine the incentive to obtain the best deal offered a consumer.
2011.10-708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.357,1868.893,It wasn't agents and fiduciaries across the board.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1888.539,1893.658,"Well, the law has a number of contexts where you don't have to show financial losses."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.764,1904.149,"Well, that gets to a point that I am having trouble getting my arms around."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1932.834,1940.638,I think our argument is that the invasion of your statutory right to a conflict-free service is itself an injury in fact--
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1940.638,1941.257,"Okay, statutory right."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1941.257,1942.34,--But it also has--
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.34,1942.74,Could I?
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1969.407,1972.943,"--It's injury in fact in the following two senses, Judge -- Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1981.482,1981.815,Okay.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1996.975,2009.984,"I think the answer is so long as Congress has entitled you to something of potential value that isn't being denied to every other member of the public in an undifferentiated way, that is sufficient to be injury in fact."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.984,2011.801,Potential value.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2011.801,2013.02,Potential value.

2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.588,2039.638,So that is injury in fact?
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2039.638,2042.29,"--That is injury in fact, and there is another way in which it's injury in fact."

2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2051.645,2054.18,"Well, she proved that she got something less valuable."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2056.013,2062.703,"But I thought -- and maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio says this is going to cost you the same no matter what you do."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2062.703,2065.036,"--That is actually quite incorrect, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.036,2065.688,Okay.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2069.273,2076.861,"Well, the injury in fact is getting something that is potentially -- not getting something to which the law entitles you, which has potential value to you."

2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2121.408,2122.425,--No.
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2126.594,2129.229,Now we in point -- now we are at level two: It's hard to prove.

2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.349,2134.965,Okay.

2011.10-708,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.773,2149.409,What is the -- I think this is very interesting and informative to me.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2219.155,2222.44,"--Justice Breyer, the breach of contract, in some sense, is precisely that pariah."

2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2222.923,2223.923,A breach of contract.
2011.10-708,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.998,2244.937,"You mean you can sue in court even if what you come in and you say, they breached my contract, and as a result, I made $10,000 I wouldn't have otherwise made?"
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2249.505,2251.341,"--I would like $1 more, Your Your Honor."
2011.10-708,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.357,2253.407,And you can do that?
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2253.407,2257.244,"--Or -- or -- so, if there are stipulated liquidated damages, you are entitled to those as well."
2011.10-708,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.144,2259.527,No liquidated--
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2261.627,2263.912,--So that is -- that is precisely the context.
2011.10-708,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2264.629,2265.362,Counsel--
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.362,2266.947,So you would accept $1 in this case?
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2266.947,2270.133,"--Well, Your Honor, we are in -- I think that that is--"
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2274.37,2281.857,"Well, no, that -- that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets to the question of whether or not you have to actually show injury-in-fact."

2011.10-708,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.563,2292.082,Is that--
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2292.082,2293.799,--it doesn't evaporate just because you want to get--
2011.10-708,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.799,2296.2,"--Mr. Lamken, you are not seeking damages."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2300.502,2301.687,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2305.472,2306.055,So it's not that you have to prove--
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2306.055,2306.672,--for our protection.
2011.10-708,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.672,2310.876,--any other damages because the statute has specified what the recovery is.
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2310.876,2311.343,Exactly right.
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2311.343,2312.826,Do you want -- I'm sorry.

2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.533,2324.766,Do you want to get out of this deal?
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2324.766,2328.587,"Your Honor, I don't know whether or not Ms. Edwards would want to get out of the deal or not."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2336.741,2351.953,"I didn't see -- I didn't see an allegation for a decision or -- or -- so you are perfectly happy as far as we know from the complaint with this deal, you just want the extra $500 per class member without showing any injury--"
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2351.953,2372.081,"--I think this -- I think this brings me back to the question you were asking me before, which is indeed, we think it's like that there is -- that there are diminution in quality and paying excessive price, but the law says we don't have to prove that because the law's elevated our right to a conflict-free transaction to legally protect its status."
2011.10-708,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2388.826,2393.197,"--Counsel, maybe I'm just looking at this too simply."
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2398.982,2399.651,--Yes.
2011.10-708,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2399.651,2410.039,"She is claiming that she paid that money on the statutory assumption that the agent would disclose to her any kickbacks, correct?"
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2410.039,2415.776,It's not a disclosure duty but on the statutory basis that she was entitled to a conflict-free referral.

2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2429.886,2431.988,That's exactly right.
2011.10-708,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2431.988,2433.188,"--referral, and that's not what I got?"
2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2433.188,2442.761,"Like an aggrieved trust beneficiary, she is seeking to get back something that belonged to her, $455 that she parted company with in a conflicted transaction."

2011.10-708,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2462.341,2467.078,"Not necessarily so, Your Honor, because Ohio does not preclude price competition."
2011.10-708,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2467.911,2468.378,Okay.

2011.10-708,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.359,2940.061,How much of a connection is -- is necessary?
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2970.547,2972.365,It's unclear.
2011.10-708,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.257,3022.298,"--So even though I've installed my own safety harness, which I always do when I buy a car, I can sue because this car that they sold me didn't have the safety harness."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3023.382,3023.965,That's correct.
2011.10-708,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.709,3065.042,But Justice Scalia has a point.
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3095.763,3097.346,I think it's more than prudential standing.
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3116.142,3116.677,Why do--
2011.10-708,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.677,3119.127,"What is the specific -- I'm sorry, Chief, go ahead."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.127,3122.046,--What -- why do we always say injury in fact then?
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3137.287,3140.155,"--Well, your cases actually say an injury in fact."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.296,3152.581,Because -- they also go on to say that it has to be concrete.
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3152.581,3153.348,--Right.
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3153.348,3155.866,"Real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3155.866,3156.7,That's right.
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.322,3171.126,"So that all of our cases, we could have left ""in fact"" out of all of them."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3175.245,3178.214,"--Well, I -- I don't know if you could have left it out."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3182.684,3187.053,"The difference between legal harm, though -- isn't that -- I guess I'm just repeating myself."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3191.456,3207.899,"--Well, an injury in fact is not simply a legal injury in the sense of any violation of the law, it is an invasion of a legally protected interest with respect to this particular individual, the particular plaintiff."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3207.899,3211.085,"The two elements, that's the particularized requirement, and I understand that."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3215.739,3218.024,"No, no, no, no."
2011.10-708,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3268.374,3270.057,I'm not sure about trespass.
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3287.601,3289.537,--And why you have that is--
2011.10-708,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3289.537,3293.739,And there -- there is an injury to that right.
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3295.457,3297.809,--But if the right's threatened--
2011.10-708,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3297.809,3304.88,--you want to say that Congress can say that you have a right to buy a conflict-free title insurance policy.
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3307.515,3318.139,"--Well, going back to your hypothetical, the reason you have that interest, the reason you have the right to exclude this space is solely by operation of the law."
2011.10-708,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3332.38,3337.184,"Well, but it's essential to my -- it's essential to my feeling of security and dignity and privacy."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3343.172,3352.711,--I don't -- I don't think the -- any common law court has inquired whether the invasion of -- the trespass somehow made you insecure--
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.711,3360.347,"Trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because you are talking about a property right, and you can sell a property right."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3390.486,3394.604,"--Well, anything can be monetized."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.604,3396.889,"No, this one -- that's my point."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3401.558,3402.793,Well--
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.793,3405.328,"It's not really a question, but you can answer."
2011.10-708,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3405.945,3411.649,"--Well, it is -- it's kind of a statement, although you know in this -- this is specific transaction, this is a transaction involving the plaintiff."
2011.10-708,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3421.522,3422.455,"Thank you, Mr. Yang."
2011.10-708,3,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3424.474,3428.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-708,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3438.533,3439.566,Not yours and his?
2011.10-708,3,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3440.751,3444.803,"--That of the -- that of the plaintiff and that of the government, Your Honor."
2011.10-708,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3546.669,3554.759,"What about a -- I'm sorry to interrupt your -- your concluding marks, but I am troubled by the dollar nominal damages for breach of contract."
2011.10-708,3,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3555.794,3575.338,"Well, Your Honor, in -- in a circumstance in which there is a bargain for performance, and it may well be that there is a recognition that there is value that was assigned to that performance that may be hard to measure, and therefore there is a concrete injury that is hard to measure, and the therefore nominal damages is awarded."
2011.10-708,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3601.905,3604.524,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
