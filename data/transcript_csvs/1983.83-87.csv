1983.83-87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.389,We will hear arguments first this morning in Board of Education of Paris Union School District against Vail.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,14.524,18.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.83-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,245.024,251.695,Could the board dismiss in the middle of the first year for no cause?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,251.695,254.413,"In my judgment, yes, it could."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.139,275.893,"Well, I would think you would apply to a tenured teacher."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,275.893,289.97,"It would, except for the statutory provision found in Section 24.12 which specifically says that a tenured teacher must be dismissed for specific cause."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.97,298.776,"Well then, what about the provision that says you may dismiss a probationary teacher if you give him 60 days notice before the end of his first year?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,298.776,306.581,"That provision, of course, I think has been interpreted to mean the nonrenewal aspect of a probationary teacher's contract."
1983.83-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.124,322.574,Right.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,326.826,331.23,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-87,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.23,338.55,Am I correct in recalling that none of the three judges on the Court of Appeals agreed with your analysis of state law?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,338.55,346.056,I think that can be gleaned from the fact that the dissenting justice did not discuss that in his dissent.
1983.83-87,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,346.056,349.708,He assumed there was some kind of a contractual right?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,349.708,351.46,That's correct.
1983.83-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.697,465.516,You have said you were commenting on the district court's findings.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,470.303,473.089,Yes.
1983.83-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.592,536.094,Do you disagree with that first finding or conclusion of law by the district court?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,536.094,537.629,"I do, and I will address that."
1983.83-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.629,552.171,"You have a fairly tough row to hoe in this Court, I suppose you realize, because, you know, the district judge is obviously formerly an Illinois lawyer and three judges of the Court of Appeals did not take issue with that finding."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,552.171,574.435,"This is true, except I think that this Court has the opportunity to take a look at Illinois law in this case because of the fact that not one Illinois court has ever interpreted this particular provision, that being Section 24-11."
1983.83-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.337,588.545,"Do you really think that's why we would grant certiorari in a case like this, in order to look at Illinois law and see if it were properly applied by a district court and affirmed by a Court of Appeals?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,588.545,593.43,I think that the state law issue certainly does come into play when we get into--
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.43,595.865,"You certainly don't need to win on that to win this case, do you?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,595.865,598.717,"--No, I don't believe I do."
1983.83-87,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.388,674.565,"Well, Mr. Miller, what if the board had given Vail the initial one-year contract, but at the same time had given him the statutory notice that he'd be re-employed for another year at the end of the first year?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,677.783,688.991,"Justice O'Connor, there is no statutory requirement that notice be given to the first year probationary teacher that his employment would be renewed."
1983.83-87,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.991,695.728,"Well, the point is just that it doesn't seem inconsistent with the provisions of the statute as they're set out."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,703.584,729.402,"Well, the history of the Illinois Supreme Court in interpreting the tenure provisions has been that the court has strictly construed those provisions dealing with nontenured teachers and in fact has given a tremendous amount of flexibility to boards of education in dealing with the nontenured teachers."
1983.83-87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.402,735.538,"Mr. Miller, you've used up more than a third of your time and you haven't really gotten to the heart of your case yet."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,735.538,744.577,"As I would suggest to the Court, there are four points on which I think this Court can reverse this case."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.927,817.09,"This is only slightly different from your first argument, it seems to me, because you're really saying that if he had sued in state court he would be met with your point that there was no breach of contract because we can fire for no cause at all."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,817.09,817.575,That's correct.
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.575,824.446,And that seems to me to be contrary to the state law finding by the district judge and the Court of Appeals.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,824.446,830.017,I separate the issue of whether you can have a two-year contract--
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.017,836.737,"I know you're talking about it in two different paragraphs, but it sounds like almost the same argument."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,837.771,872.51,"--Well, the important point here I think is that this Court's decisions place a great deal of importance on state law interpretation, and in this case we have not had the benefit of that analysis because we have not had a state court, whether it be an appellate court or the supreme court, address either the issue of the legality of a two-year term probationary contract nor whether, if that is authorized, that term contract constitutes property within the meaning of the Constitution."
1983.83-87,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.212,958.566,Would you feel differently about that if the contract were specifically enforceable under Illinois law?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,962.418,974.142,--That would be akin to the provisions in Section 24-12 which allow for reinstatement of a tenured teacher who would be discharged and found that the discharge was not appropriate.
1983.83-87,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,974.142,976.328,Would that be a protectable property interest?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,976.328,978.694,In my judgment it would be.
1983.83-87,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.694,982.079,Let me ask you about your deprivation argument.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1002.14,1016.633,"That's our analysis of the deprivation issue, is that his deprivation takes place if the state were to foreclose him from bringing an action for the collection of that salary that is due him in a breach of contract case."
1983.83-87,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.633,1020.351,That sounds more like an argument that he's got adequate process available.
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1032.926,1054.672,"I must grant that the deprivation concept dovetails into the due process analysis also, because one of the tests that this Court has set forth when you must determine whether there has been a violation of due process or due process without law is if the deprivation is final."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.951,1124.1,"You're saying that if they notified him that he was terminated, he was being terminated, and said, if you have any objection to this we'd be glad to give you a hearing in the local courts, we will be glad to litigate with you in the local courts, you think that is a satisfactory enough provision for a hearing?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1124.1,1132.005,"I do, because of the fact that under our law, as I've stated, he has no right to specific performance."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.005,1133.538,When was his notice given?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1133.538,1136.557,Notice was given on March 3rd.
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.557,1140.611,How far before the end of the school year?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1141.461,1142.278,Yes.
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.448,1149.634,"Well, he then knew he was terminated."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1149.634,1150.2,Yes.
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.2,1168.945,"He could have, I suppose, brought suit in the state court right then, and I suppose, although you perhaps don't get specific performance, could the local courts... suppose they didn't get around to trying the case until after June."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1177.551,1182.955,The notice that terminated his services said that the effective date was June the 15th.
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.955,1185.157,"Well, so he had 60 days to bring the suit."
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1185.157,1185.723,"Yes, he did."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1198.548,1200.5,You mean they couldn't have enjoined the board of education?
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1200.5,1210.105,"That's correct, because under Illinois law he has an adequate remedy for damages, and that is the appropriate remedy for a breach of contract."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.105,1213.307,"And the only remedy of a probationary teacher, you say?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1213.307,1214.576,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.396,1223.432,"You never got around to your fourth point, did you?"
1983.83-87,0,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,1223.432,1244.862,"My fourth point, Justice White, was a combination of the deprivation and due process analysis and, as I've suggested to the Court, because of the state law remedy there has been no denial of due process without law."
1983.83-87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.862,1256.586,Mr. Ansel.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1256.586,1259.955,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.17,1320.595,"Mr. Ansel, what elements of your client's case other than the final constitutional framing of it come from any place other than Illinois law?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1320.595,1328.182,"In fact, none of the elements of the protectable interest come from any place but Illinois law."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.182,1331.401,So it's really a diversity case without diversity.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1331.401,1341.776,"Well, it is more than a diversity case, only because of the question of whether he was entitled to a hearing or some type of pre-deprivation process under the Constitution."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.362,1359.737,"But all of the analysis that goes into deciding whether he has what you refer to as a protectable property interest depends entirely on Illinois contract law, doesn't it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1359.737,1377.099,"I think for the purposes of this case I can rely on the findings of the two lower courts and say that it does, because that is all that is necessary to reach the heart of this case, which is what process is actually due, given a protectable interest."
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.186,1423.394,"Well, Mr. Ansel, do you agree that the only remedy provided under Illinois law for a breach is a damages action--"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1423.394,1423.913,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1423.913,1425.362,--for a non-tenured teacher?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1425.362,1427.797,That is the only remedy provided by Illinois law.
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1427.797,1439.272,And you also agree that Illinois law did not provide for a hearing before the notice of termination as a matter of state law?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1439.272,1440.972,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1440.972,1450.48,Do you think that that affects the reasonableness of the reliance by a probationary teacher on those processes?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1459.603,1468.608,I think that the absence of an explicit provision in Illinois law for a hearing does not mean that a hearing could not be provided.
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.432,1500.311,"Well, isn't it possible at least that the notion of a property interest protectable under the Fourteenth Amendment should turn at least in part on the reasonableness of the owner's reliance on whatever entitlement he has?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1500.311,1509.435,"Yes, I think it should, and in this case the reliance, based on every fact in the record, would be a reasonable reliance."
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.435,1516.355,"Well, but if under state law he's not entitled to a hearing, why is it reasonable to expect it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1516.355,1529.58,"It's reasonable to expect a hearing because hearings are provided for all teachers that are terminated in the middle of their terms, because cause is an element of that termination."
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1545.375,1553.278,"Well, you're arguing that as a matter of constitutional law that's so, but certainly not as a matter of state law."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1553.278,1555.764,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.628,1580.365,"Mr. Ansel, a moment ago you said that Illinois gave no adequate remedy to your client."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1584.5,1588.469,I believe that he would have had a damages remedy under Illinois law.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.469,1596.641,"Well, since that's all that the district court gave him, was damages, why wasn't his remedy under Illinois law every bit as adequate as it was in the district court?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1596.641,1608.782,I think our choice not to appeal the award of damages for failure to provide additional elements should not be taken as an indication by us that those are adequate.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.782,1613.253,So really you feel your remedy in the district court wasn't adequate either?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1613.253,1620.023,"I think that that is true, and the reason is more complicated than might first appear."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.234,1683.697,"If damages is all he could get, I suppose any public employer can illegally fire a person, can fire a person in breach of contract."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1689.351,1690.601,"Well, I think that--"
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.601,1691.717,--isn't that right?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1693.819,1700.39,"--No, I do not concede that compensatory damages in a breach of contract claim are an adequate remedy."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.39,1703.759,"Well, I know, but how about under Illinois law?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1705.96,1709.862,"That is correct, but I do not concede that that is adequate."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.862,1713.449,You mean the Constitution requires more?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1713.449,1722.655,"I think that the Constitution requires more in terms of the deprivation process, because the remedy is so inadequate under Illinois law."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.12,1752.691,Are you contending he had a federal constitutional right to reinstatement?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1752.691,1759.361,"I'm contending that, if he had a protectable interest, the Civil Rights Act does provide that as one remedy."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.361,1762.313,"Well, I understand that, but that's not my question."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1777.34,1781.377,I am not contending that there's a federal constitutional right to get the job back.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.786,1803.64,"I thought your argument at least was, one of your arguments was, that until he had a pre-deprivation hearing he was entitled to stay on the job."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1803.64,1805.242,I think that is my argument.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.242,1821.586,"And that on that basis if they'd have given him a pre-deprivation hearing they would have to at the end of that hearing have complied with Illinois law, and he may have stayed on the job throughout his second year."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1821.586,1829.741,I am not contending that the reinstatement remedy alone would provide him with due process.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.741,1837.38,But you say he was entitled to stay on the job and receive his weekly pay or monthly pay until they give him a hearing.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1837.38,1838.363,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1838.363,1843.701,"I gather he lost his job by a 3-2 vote, didn't he?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1843.701,1847.736,I think that that was the vote when he was terminated.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1847.736,1854.323,And I take it your position is that if he had a hearing the 3-2 might have come out the other way?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1854.323,1858.877,That is in my opinion the very essence of procedural process.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.494,1861.263,And then he would not have lost his job at all.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1861.263,1862.846,--That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.07,1879.29,"Now, tell us again, where does that right to a hearing come from?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1881.226,1889.496,--The right to a hearing comes from the Civil Rights Act if state law provides a protectable interest.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.505,1933.359,"Well, you had 60 days to bring a suit in state court before the termination of his first year."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1933.359,1935.294,We did bring suit within 60 days.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.294,1936.344,In the state court?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1936.344,1936.761,"No, sir."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.979,1938.496,"Well, I know."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1946.335,1946.902,The only remedy--
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.902,1954.088,How do you know what... you might have been able to get an injunction.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1954.088,1959.492,--I don't think there is any authority in Illinois law for an injunction under these circumstances.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1961.761,1965.979,"No, but you could have brought your 1983 suit in the state courts, couldn't you?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1965.979,1967.579,"Yes, I could have brought my 1983--"
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.579,1971.133,"And then I take it the state court would have to apply federal law, wouldn't it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1971.133,1971.967,--That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.967,1975.335,And if federal law entitled you to an injunction you might have gotten it.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1975.335,1976.352,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.352,1980.323,Even though if you had a count for a state remedy you can only get damages.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,1980.323,1981.139,That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.21,2016.746,You might have faced a malpractice suit.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2016.746,2020.448,"Among other things, I might have faced a malpractice suit, that is true."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.448,2029.655,Why would Edgar County be so unsympathetic when all of your substantive rights are based on Illinois law?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2033.873,2057.389,"I am saying that there is a real question, when you get into litigation in the state courts, of all of the vagaries of the statute of frauds and parole evidence and even findings of fact and statements made in the record, and I believe that one of the purposes of allowing dual jurisdiction in the case of civil rights is to be able to avoid some of the passion and personal prejudice that might exist in state courts."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.389,2065.828,"That reason has certainly been traditionally advanced, the idea being that federal courts may be more sympathetic to federal law claims."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2072.248,2081.788,"In fact, the only thing that arises from Illinois case law is the interest or the claim of entitlement that we seek to protect in this case."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.233,2110.957,"Well, of course you say Illinois law is inadequate, but in a sense Illinois is perfectly capable of defining its rights and assigning what procedures all he available to enforce them, isn't it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2110.957,2117.044,"--Yes, they are, but the question of adequacy of those procedures is one of constitutional dimensions."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.979,2119.863,Recently.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2119.863,2122.498,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.633,2126.833,Do you rely on Logan for that purpose?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2126.833,2128.116,--That is Logan.
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.672,2221.695,Would you consider Judge Posner's argument about the paperclip contract?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2234.185,2238.406,"--It would... the analysis would apply, but I believe the result would be different."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.022,2263.055,But what if he isn't?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2273.912,2288.939,"I think that if the interest at stake, the private interest at stake were truly substantial, as the hypothetical you might prescribe, then perhaps an ear should be given to whether that interest is substantial enough to require a simple explanation."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.939,2292.757,"Well, turn the case around and assume your client was a millionaire."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2296.359,2312.37,"I think that he may very well have a claim, because the difference between... the impact on him is a more tangential question than evaluating the private interest of employment."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.626,2323.643,"Well, maybe he likes to coach."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2323.643,2330.849,"--Well, I think he does, and I think he likes to teach, and I think that therein lies the difference between the paperclip and teaching."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.695,2360.951,"Well, then the federal remedy must have been a great disappointment to him, just as the state remedy was, since it was only... it would have been, just because it was only damages."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2360.951,2379.663,"I think the disappointment that my client had was in how long it took us to be able to generate the evidence necessary to seek relief and, with the one year that he had remaining as an expectancy, the realities of federal litigation and the limits of his interest made it impossible to go for reinstatement."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.262,2404.247,Did you try for a preliminary injunction?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2404.247,2422.792,"I did not try for a preliminary injunction until I could determine what was going to be said by the school board members, and that was easily found out because I was told right at the very beginning that two board members were going to say that the promise was made by all of them and four board members were going to deny that that promise was made."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.792,2426.761,But that all could have come out at the preliminary injunction hearing.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2426.761,2435.966,"I think it could have, and I think at that point in time we might very well have had a hearing that would have indicated the likelihood of prevailing on the merits."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.378,2479.978,May I ask one other question.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2490.119,2496.457,"In fact, I am arguing less than that, because the case doesn't require me to say that."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.248,2512.366,"In other words, it's kind of a notice requirement rather than a hearing requirement."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2512.366,2515.784,It's a notice of reason and an opportunity to respond.
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.784,2518.27,But would it be adequate of the response was in writing?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2524.357,2531.596,"I think that if the opportunity to respond were provided in writing, and depending upon what the reasons were it might be--"
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.596,2533.413,You lost too many football games.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2533.413,2545.504,"--I think under those circumstances a real opportunity to change their minds is what is required, and I might question, when it could be as easily provided that they could have a conference as writing a letter--"
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.504,2553.109,"Is it correct, then, that the particular procedure that the Constitution commands depends pretty much on the facts of the particular controversy?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2553.109,2568.969,"--Well, I think that that is correct, because certain reasons for termination... if the reason was only that the football record was not a good enough record, then perhaps that reason wouldn't be sufficient to generate a full-blown adversarial hearing."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.813,2609.046,"Well, suppose the board had said to him, look, it's 60 days until the end of the term, we'll see you in court and we'll make all the explanation we have, we'll put the evidence on the record, and if we've breached our contract you'll get a remedy, I suppose, and they said also, we'll guarantee that the hearing in state court will be concluded within 60 days."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2609.046,2615.6,--This would not be adequate because the opportunity to work has still been taken away.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.6,2616.2,"No, it hasn't yet."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2617.219,2623.023,"But if he goes to court and wins within 60 days, the only thing he gets is money damages."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.908,2627.408,"--Well, I know."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2641.751,2642.367,"--Yes, he is."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.105,2651.773,"Well, that is--"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2662.665,2666.45,"I think that that would be the best opportunity, and in light of this--"
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2666.45,2676.424,"Well, I don't understand why you're willing to settle for anything less than a hearing of some kind before the five of them so that maybe you can change the minds of one of the three."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2676.424,2677.79,--I am not.
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2686.796,2688.548,You don't want him to lose it.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2688.548,2695.752,I want an opportunity to determine the rightful or wrongful nature of the deprivation before its lost.
1983.83-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.752,2702.642,"And you concede that the state law doesn't provide for any such hearing, but that the Constitution mandates it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2702.642,2718.501,"I concede that state law does not provide it and, considering how easy it would be to provide him with reasons and considering how much risk there is of a wrongful deprivation when he could be terminated with no reasons, that the Constitution requires it."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.501,2734.377,"What if Illinois followed their common law rule of Lumley against Wagner and said contracts for personal services simply are not enforceable, specifically enforceable, and they applied that to private contractors and also to public contractors like the school district here."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2742.283,2747.437,I don't think that the due process law prevents Illinois from following its own remedies.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.377,2780.158,"And would you say that in a case where Illinois followed the rule that contracts for personal services are not specifically enforceable, that 1983 and the due process clause says then a federal court or a state court acting under the federal Constitution may specifically enforce contracts for personal services?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2780.158,2781.841,I think that is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.841,2784.126,When did that change occur?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2784.126,2788.112,I'm not sure I understand what change you're talking about?
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.112,2798.219,"Well, I think most courts had felt that Lumley against Wagner was quite a viable rule, not just for 150 years, but right up until today."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2798.219,2802.171,The Lumley rule is the one that states that federal courts can provide no addition--
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.171,2810.36,"No, the Lumley rule, it's a rule of contracts that says contracts for personal services generally are not specifically enforceable."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2817.014,2819.299,--And this is a principle of federal law?
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.299,2823.518,"No, I believe it's a well-recognized... did you take contracts in law school?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2823.518,2824.537,"Yes, I did."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.537,2826.253,"Well, maybe they didn't treat it there."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2834.643,2838.011,And I think this is the rule of Illinois law.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.116,2855.389,"Well, so what case from this Court has changed it so that state courts can no longer apply Lumley against Wagner?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2855.389,2860.61,The state courts can apply it unless the Civil Rights Act is the basis for the cause of action.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.745,2875.203,"Well, what case says that a federal court may grant specific performance of a contract for personal services where the state followed a rule that you could not have specific performance?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2875.203,2878.071,This is the meaning and the intent of the Civil Rights Act.
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.071,2883.825,"Well, do you have a case in this Court that says that is the meaning and intent of the Civil Rights Act?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2883.825,2890.729,"I have nothing more than the remedies provided by the legislature, by the Congress when they granted, the Civil Rights Act passed."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.729,2899.001,"Did Congress say, you shall have in federal court under 1983 a right to specific performance of a contract for personal services?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2899.001,2901.453,"Yes, in effect they did."
1983.83-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2901.937,2908.224,"Well now, when you say 1983?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2908.224,2923.633,"--Yes, they did, when they said that the equitable powers that were granted by the Civil Rights Act would empower any court in which such a proceeding was brought to use those equitable remedies."
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2923.633,2939.562,"Well, until this minute I had understood all you were complaining about is that you didn't get a pre-deprivation hearing, meanwhile hanging onto the job with the hope that at the hearing you could charge somebody's mind."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2943.514,2949.268,"I'm not after specific performance, but I'm after the opportunity to remain whole--"
1983.83-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2949.268,2952.886,"But all you want's a hearing, a pre-deprivation hearing, wasn't it?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2952.886,2953.853,--That is correct.
1983.83-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2953.853,2957.024,What would you do about that hearing if you got it now?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2957.024,2965.11,"If we got it now, we have already lost the opportunity to work and it would no longer be adequate."
1983.83-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2965.11,2968.679,So damages is the only available remedy?
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,2968.679,2985.205,"In my case, under these circumstances, where the expectancy was only one more year, I think that by the time we get to the Supreme Court on appeal it is no longer practical to expect reinstatement on the part of either Petitioners or the Respondent."
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.98,3039.022,"What would you have done if when you got the notice of termination, when your client got the notice of termination, the board had said: Should you care to have a hearing before us, please show up next Monday night at 6:00 o'clock."
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,3058.469,3066.609,--I think that under the procedural due process analysis that we make here that process would have satisfied due process.
1983.83-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.299,3085.003,"Well, did he ever, as a matter of fact did he ever ask why he was fired?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,3085.003,3089.355,"Yes, he did, and he was told: We don't have to give you any reasons."
1983.83-87,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3119.224,3130.432,"But Mr. Ansel, even if he had had the hearing the school board would not have been required to give him their reasons, would they?"
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,3130.432,3140.44,"If he was not provided with reasons, then he had no meaningful opportunity at a meaningful time and there would be a violation of due process."
1983.83-87,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.581,3154.448,May I ask just one question.
1983.83-87,1,35367,marc_j_ansel,,3171.475,3196.777,"I understand that the due process elements would not be applied in a situation of private employment, and I understand that the due process clause was intended to have the government interact with the citizens on a higher level or on a fundamentally fair level, maybe one that isn't used often enough in private business."
1983.83-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.729,3202.129,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Miller?"
1983.83-87,2,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,3202.129,3205.382,"I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-87,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.142,3274.377,"But Mr. Miller, if the law were perfectly clear, and I don't suggest it is, that the Constitution required a public employer to give a pre-termination hearing... say that was clearly the law... and you fired a man without giving him such a hearing, he promptly went into federal court and asked for an injunction, saying I want that hearing before the discharge becomes effective, are you saying a federal court would not in those circumstances have power to enter a temporary restraining order?"
1983.83-87,2,43007,thomas_reed_miller,,3274.377,3281.547,"No, I do not believe that... I believe that the federal court has that power to certainly issue that injunction."
