1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,44.597,"Number 85, United States, Appellant, versus Charles Jackson et al."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,45.639,48.615,Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.
1967.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.899,335.611,Is this what had happened just in any criminal case or is this under the statute?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,335.611,337.415,"Well, I think there would be no --"
1967.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.415,342.538,I mean under all of the statutes that provides for jury provision in the sense.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,342.538,346.469,"Well that's a very limited number insofar as the federal scheme is concerned, Your Honor."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.469,348.193,"It's in the district though, isn't it?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,348.193,348.661,Pardon me sir.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,348.661,352.381,Isn't this true of some statutes in the district?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,352.381,358.322,"There is a somewhat similar statute in the district on rape, yes, on rape (Voice Overlap)."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.322,359.858,Is that also true do you think --
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,359.858,360.331,Pardon sir.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,360.331,373.204,Is that true in the district that even if a jury on a rape conviction was not to make a recommendation and therefore death ordinarily will follow but the judge nevertheless may impose life.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,373.204,378.273,"No, I'm adverting to the case where there is no jury trial."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.273,379.589,None at all?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,379.589,383.483,"On the issue of guilt, whether the judge in that circumstance, and that's from being the jury (Voice Overlap)."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,383.483,385.607,"Yes, I'm anticipating you."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,389.701,390.926,"No, no."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.926,398.635,Isn't there also a question here of what happens in the circumstance where the jury does in fact make no recommendations?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,399.583,408.301,"No, I think where its common ground that there is no recommendation, the maximum penalty is imprisonment."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.301,413.571,Right and suppose it does make a recommendation of death because that's what I'm going to --
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,413.571,422.381,Then we have a question as to which there is a difference of views between the parties as to whether the judge is bound to follow that recommendation.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.381,424.739,"Yes, and the Government's position that he is not?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,424.739,425.842,That he is not.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.842,429.323,And why?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,429.323,434.742,"Well, because the statute itself doesn't make it binding to begin with that and that's how we interpret the statute."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,445.882,450.674,"Well I take it as -- if you're right in the way you read it, there's not a constitutional question here at all."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,450.674,464.638,"I think that, if we are right in the way we read it, that the claim that there is a substantial disparity of risk whether you demand the jury trial or whether you seek to waive it, drops out."
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,465.968,472.405,But does a statute itself provide what the judge may on a panel jury for the penalty?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,472.405,473.871,"No, it does not --"
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,473.871,477.726,Where does that strain from -- the power strained above the rule?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,477.726,498.908,The -- one Court that specifically analyzed that question started with the proposition that Congress certainly could not have intended that the man who acknowledges his guilt by pleading guilty should be in a better position than the man who contests his guilt.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.721,587.499,"Now, going beyond that Mr. Spritzer, any of those cases where there's been a plea and then a jury has been convened on the issue of punishment, had there been death sentences recommended which recommendations have been rejected by sentencing judges?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,587.499,590.025,Where a jury was convened on the issue of punishment?
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,590.025,594.337,Yes.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,594.337,613.2,"There is a case in Kentucky, the Robinson case which we have also cited, which expresses the opinion contrary to that adopted by Judge Timbers that a Court would not be bound by such a recommendation."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,634.865,643.852,"Well, I suppose your footnote to that Court, supposed convening of juries after guilty pleas."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,646.29,651.962,Those are in at least five cases where a Court accepted a guilty plea.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,654.644,659.573,"Now, in any of those -- in any of those cases, do we know whether the jury recommended death and that --"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,659.573,664.489,It did in five cases and the judge acted on the recommendation.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.489,667.252,No instance of a rejection on the jury recommendation?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,667.252,670.397,"No, there were 10 cases in all of --"
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,670.397,684.185,Well have you have any experience either statistically or considered by any federal court of a jury recommendation of death in any case where the judge rejected the jury recommendation.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,684.185,686.523,"No, I think the judge has accepted it."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,710.87,714.074,Do we have any experience of that of any kind in the federal system?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,714.074,714.984,In the federal system?
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,714.984,716.537,Yes.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,717.105,724.284,"No, these are the only two statutes under which we've had experienced with under a provision --"
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.284,728.002,"Well, it has been experienced under the district rape statute, isn't it?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,728.002,735.898,"Yes, though in that case, I don't think there'd been any death sentences executed for something like 20 years."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,735.898,743.853,I know but do we know of any experience of -- when there was a recommendation of the death sentence that the judge rejected it?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,743.853,750.747,I do -- there are only three cases as I understand it in the District of Columbia statute where death was imposed.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,759.21,766.205,Were any of those appellants actually excluded whether an advisory jury?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,766.205,766.351,Yes.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,766.351,767.297,In the federal system?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,767.297,767.99,Yes.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,767.99,768.609,There were?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,768.609,769.19,Yes.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,769.19,777.911,"Now, may I ask Mr. Spritzer, if you look at the arguments of the judge on that one case that you've told me --"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,777.911,778.1,Yes sir.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,778.1,782.747,"-- what you're talking about, is that the argument of the government or do you put it on another ground?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,782.747,789.513,"We -- no, we make the same argument that the judge accepted in the Robinson case."
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,789.513,790.061,I see.
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,790.061,805.878,"That under this statute, a fair reading would permit the Court to hold and we think it's the desirable as well as the permissible interpretation that the judge is not bound by the jury recommendation."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,879.062,887.79,"And I supposed, it's not imposed the last words of this section suggest imposition by the judge."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,887.79,890.269,"Yes, its' the judge who imposes a sentence."
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1277.532,1280.494,Am I right Mr. Spritzer on waiver of jury trial?
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1289.997,1290.49,That's right.
1967.85,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.678,1331.66,"Well, it's in the hands of the prosecution if I guess it would be."
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1335.993,1348.024,"Yes, of course, there still remains the question of a plea of guilty which is discretionary with the judge but in which the prosecution does not play a role."
1967.85,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1403.685,1417.789,"Is there any room for an argument that if the defendant waive a jury trial, he also waives with respect to penalty and gives the judge the right to impose of death sentence?"
1967.85,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1417.789,1436.762,I would not -- we do not urge that argument (Voice Overlap) I would have difficulty with that argument because it seems to me that the congressional scheme contemplates that the death penalty may be imposed only if a jury immediately reaches that conclusion.
1967.85,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1704.924,1706.075,Mr. Duke
1967.85,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1706.075,1710.565,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
