1972.72-493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.76,"-- number 72-493, Vlandis against Kline and others."
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,10.226,11.099,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,141.576,148.159,"In Dunn v. Blumstein even if he is there, over the period of time he is not eligible to vote?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,148.159,148.948,"That is correct Your Honor, that is --"
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,148.948,152.946,If he -- how long has he stayed in college in Connecticut?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,155.347,156.016,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,157.846,173.341,"If the person enrolls in the University and the next day he becomes a citizen, and the next year votes, he is still a non-resident for seven years so far as University is concerned?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,173.341,175.588,"Well, Your Honor, that is the way it's been interpreted."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,192.962,197.107,"If he gets elected the Mayor of Town of New Haven, he is still a non-resident?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,197.107,198.283,That is correct Your Honor.
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,198.283,201.028,And how in the world do you justify that?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,201.028,204.144,"Your Honor, I justify that on this basis."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.365,289.415,"You just told us, but you're not saying that's helpful, but on the other hand, unless I'm mistaken, your brothers on the other side are not saying either that a state university may not charge a differential, a higher tuition of non-residents and than it does to residents."
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,292.797,294.656,"Well, I think it's a little more than that Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.846,314.991,"Well, a non-married student would have to live for a solid year in Connecticut before applying?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,314.991,315.734,That is correct Your Honor.
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.734,322.206,As I understand your definition and a married student would have to be in Connecticut at the time he or she applied?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,322.206,326.339,"That's correct and I don't think that present any particular hardship, what that means --"
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,326.339,333.428,"That's concerned at your argument, I know, but I just saw and I can understand the issue because it's not that clear to me."
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,348.24,349.069,They do not.
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.069,360.494,"But they do attack, the presumption that once a non-resident, always a non-resident and the inability of anybody to prove that he actually is a bona fide resident of Connecticut at some stage of the game, isn't that it?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,360.494,365.552,That's right and they should have the opportunity to show a changed circumstance.
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.552,367.032,Yes.
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,367.032,385.852,"And what I'm arguing is that under the “rational basis” test, this -- what amounts to a one year waiting period is a rational approach for the state to take to help finance the system of higher education, because we're not talking about even the out of state person deferring the entire cost of his education."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.679,407.856,How is it reasonable to say that the Mayor of New Haven is not a resident?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,407.856,411.392,"He is not a resident for tuition purposes, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,414.65,424.935,"Well, assume that in my hypothetical the Mayor of New Haven is also multi-million dollar's millionaire and he's paying his taxes regularly?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,424.935,427.33,"Well, I think the argument Mr. Chief Justice is that --"
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,427.33,431.131,"You say this is rational, I want to see how rational it is?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,437.896,448.574,"What's rational is that the state is seeking to support higher education and it in effect divides the students into two classes, out of state and in-state and it does say --"
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.574,450.744,I respectfully disagree.
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,466.71,467.525,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.444,477.949,"Discriminate between the person who has matriculated as resident for one day, is that right?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,477.949,479.639,"Yeah, while a person taking the example --"
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,479.639,482.961,Against those who have been resident for years?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,482.961,484.423,That is correct.
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,484.423,486.967,What rationalization is there with that?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,486.967,496.894,"Because the legislature wanted to draw a line, it chose to draw was this one-year residence duration."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.117,505.412,Could that be rational for one year's tuition or rational for seven years of tuition?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,505.412,522.515,"Well, my point is Your Honor any time this person wants to us -- anytime Mayor of New Haven wants to establish residency for tuition purposes, all he has to do is withdraw from the university and that indicates that he is not in the state purely for purposes of getting state education."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.593,549.639,"But your rationalization have to be year, whether he is in the state or out of the state is not a rationalization, then I can understand?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,549.639,550.97,"Well, let me try it a different way."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.97,559.224,I can understand that for the one year he can be -- he is a non-resident for that one year?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,559.224,578.178,"Well -- what the statute really operates on Your Honor, if I can read the legislative intent correctly, is that there is a presumption that the person who comes into the state and attends an institution of higher education is here not to become a bona fide resident of the state, but to secure advantages and public eduction."
1972.72-493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.178,584.68,"Don't you think the State of Connecticut, thinks that that's such a wonderful state and if I want to stay then?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,584.68,613.739,"Well, Your Honor I would hope they would think that, but I think, what I'm arguing here is what I think was the intent of the legislature in passing this Act and I think that was the design of it, not to necessarily discourage people from coming in, but saying they will not be subsidized, recently arrived students will not receive the same subsidy as those who have had been in the state for longer period of time and --"
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.739,652.36,"That's I think really a constitutional analysis that this might be promoted if we forget about residents and nonresidents and just the question is whether or not the state can create categories that you have just described, that a person who when he applies and has admitted to a state university in Connecticut is a nonresident, can Connecticut say that no matter whether or not, he later becomes a bona fide resident for every other purpose, nonetheless, for this purpose we categorize him as a person who has to pay higher tuition?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,652.36,653.379,"That is the issue, Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.379,654.234,"That's really is, isn't it?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,654.234,655.737,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the issue."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,655.737,664.462,"And I think maybe when we talk about residents for other purposes, we get -- cloud the analysis a little bit?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,664.462,665.739,"Very well, and I won't talk about residents for other purpose."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.739,669.783,"No, I am just suggesting it and for me at least it helps to --"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,669.783,678.018,Alright then I will zone in any particular question that we have here and that is for educational purposes only.
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.09,823.038,"How much, do have any idea how much of the cost of education in Connecticut public institutions apply on them, is financed by the federal government?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,823.038,823.939,"No, I don't Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.657,826.435,"10 %, 20%?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,826.435,827.273,It varies.
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.891,831.322,25%?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,831.322,834.003,"It could well be 25%, that is correct."
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.003,846.357,"What about the justification of, foreclosing the federal subsidies to (Inaudible)?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,846.357,851.269,"Well, they would have the benefit of that subsidy at whatever -- where they qualify."
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.269,854.833,(Inaudible).
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,854.833,857.235,"I am afraid, I don't understand your question Mr. Justice."
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.235,870.931,"Let assume that all of the subsidy that you say is -- just assume that all of the subsidy you say that students get at the University of Connecticut were furnished by the federal government, assume that all of them?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,870.931,875.977,"That it all then I would have a very difficult argument I think, but that is not case --"
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.977,878.749,But the Columbus isn't camp of this.
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,878.749,888.671,I think I have figures here in my brief where I cite that even the out of state student is subsidized more than half of the cost of its education even under the --
1972.72-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.671,891.759,The fact that that is a perhaps federal government money?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,891.759,897.338,"Some of that may well be federal government money in the form of all sorts of grants, that is correct."
1972.72-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.338,919.052,"But Mr. Hill, I understand one of your or what I thought your response to Justice White's first question to be that say if a student from Colorado goes to Connecticut, the Connecticut rule may deny him the benefit of this federally subsidized Connecticut education, but presumably the state education in Colorado is also subsidized by the federal government, so this state in Colorado --"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,919.052,921.354,"Oh, yes this was really – that was the answer."
1972.72-493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.787,1012.253,"Suppose the student went to Connecticut and enrolled in a private college, attended that college for one year maintaining his residence there of course, then he meets the eligibility standard of the Connecticut statute to move to a state university the next year?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1012.253,1013.782,"He certainly would, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1029.964,1048.198,That -- you know that in hypothetical case that person might or might not if were son of parents living in Chicago who were paying all his expenses and if he is driving a car with the Chicago license plate and went back for every vacation and spent the summers back home in Illinois he wouldn't have become eligible --
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1048.198,1049.831,"Of course not, and he shouldn't."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1049.831,1053.333,"Well, isn't that more or less a typical student at least at one side?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1053.333,1055.835,"Oh, I don't think so today Your Honor."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1057.873,1062.591,Most of them have living parents and who go home for vacations and they will retain their --
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1062.591,1066.422,"Well, a good number of them don't."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1066.422,1073.751,"Isn't it therefore a question of fact in each case, whether a person has actually become a resident of the place where he has going to college?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1073.751,1077.775,"Under the example of the Chief Justice gave, that would be a question of fact."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.211,1084.175,And went home for Christmas.
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1084.175,1084.885,"Right, he would not."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1084.885,1088.795,"Consider that home back in Chicago, he wouldn't be able to be resident of Connecticut."
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1088.795,1092.704,"He would not have established the bona-fide is necessary, that's correct."
1972.72-493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1092.704,1107.936,"Your response to my hypothetical, then included the proposition that in attending the Yale or some other private school in Connecticut, he had also taken all the other steps to establish legal residence?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1107.936,1109.675,"Yes, that's correct Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1109.675,1120.409,And probably I suppose it'd be fair to say that most of the students who come to a university like Yale do not establish a residence for other purposes?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1120.409,1125.601,"Most of the undergraduates do not, most of the graduates students do interestingly enough."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1169.054,1170.284,Has it ever been overcome in that case?
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1170.284,1172.027,"Not to my knowledge, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.027,1177.867,"-- where the Court begins by saying that we must find a compelling state interest, has the state ever won a case?"
1972.72-493,0,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,1177.867,1183.121,"Not that I know off and that's why I didn't pursue that argument, I wouldn't take up the Court's time with it."
1972.72-493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.326,1188.363,Thank you Mr. Hill.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1196.33,1200.844,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.651,1248.58,"Well, the statute talks in terms of legal address, legal address."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1259.724,1266.013,"Yes, if that was not under the statute, Mr. Justice Stewart that would not be a factual inquiry."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.23,1283.116,"But the test is legal address, whatever that may mean?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1283.116,1290.321,Whatever that may mean and I assume that under the statute whatever is asserted will be accepted.
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.963,1339.88,"Connecticut says we're not interested in the test, in the ordinary conventional, traditional, legal test of domicile or residence."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1384.729,1385.765,"No, I really don't think so, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1385.765,1386.841,Why not?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1388.516,1395.074,"Because in the proper justifications by the state for adopting that statute, they cite two reasons."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.367,1431.479,We may make a presumption that an applicant from out of state probably has not been contributing to the tax basis of Connecticut until he -- before that time.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1439.459,1440.932,"I don't think so, because as a result of --"
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.932,1441.799,As the question --
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1441.799,1443.722,As a result of that presumption --
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.722,1445.125,Isn't that the question?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1445.125,1447.011,"No, I still don't think that's the question."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.414,1459.993,"You're answering the question, but what I'm asking is, what is the question in this case?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1473.687,1485.172,"Yes, I think that maybe the issue, but I think that the reasons the state says it needs this law, and what it is trying to accomplish by having this law have to be taken into consideration."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.079,1549.507,Is gasoline tax restricted to the roads?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1549.507,1550.476,As a highway tax?
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1550.476,1550.984,Yeah.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1550.984,1552.358,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.358,1553.875,So what's it got to do with this case?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1553.875,1582.71,"I'm putting into perspective merely in showing the Court that in the total operating budget, and in the amount of money that would cost inversely, one of the arguments proffered by the state and also in terms of cost equalization, anyone who is in Connecticut, who is either driving a car or buying merchandised is in fact contributing to the cost and to the tax basis --"
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.71,1599.64,"Mr. Dziamba, do you attack the basic constitutional right of the state of Connecticut's universities and colleges to charge a higher tuition to bona fide non-residents and they do the bona fide residents?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1599.64,1600.796,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.796,1610.219,"Well then, that's all it's about, because the bona fide a non-resident certainly while he is in the state uses the roads and pays gasoline taxes and so on."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1611.992,1612.724,No I'm not.
1972.72-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1650.99,1663.196,Mr. Dziamba would you concede that the State of Connecticut could restrict its state supported institutions to residents of the state?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1663.196,1667.477,"Are you indicating citizens, bona fide residents?"
1972.72-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1667.477,1669.731,"No, not necessarily, residents of the state?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1669.731,1712.366,"I think that's a very difficult question and the one that is first of all not presented by the facts of this case and I think that it would have to be analyzed in terms of the standards already set down by this Court and that is, the state may have a special public interest it wants to protect, but as the amicus points out in its table one a lot of that money comes from federal funds -- that would have to be a clear showing, I think in the record first of all, as to what evil the state is trying to protect itself against by limiting a state benefit only to residents of that state."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.366,1720.106,"It might not be wanting to protect itself against any evil, it's just what purpose is the state trying to accomplish and that would be very obvious."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1725.935,1728.649,"But it's the determination of who is a resident, which is a --"
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.649,1730.228,"No, that's quite a different question."
1972.72-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.93,1733.489,Mr. Dziamba?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1733.489,1734.613,Yes sir.
1972.72-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.613,1764.715,"The classical case of the legislature is saying, from the existence of fact 'a' the existence of fact 'b' will be conclusively presumed and when you're discussing the constitutionality of that you don't discuss necessarily fact 'b' or the relation between fact 'b' and fact 'a' you discuss whether or not the legislature can properly require the existence of fact 'a' because it's said that one file is from the other."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1767.565,1773.815,"Well, I think that the legislative presumption that has no basis of fact is one that would not be allowed."
1972.72-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.815,1785.04,"No, but you're there -- you meet that by saying what the legislature has in fact required is unconstitutional."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1795.342,1800.638,"Well, I again come back to responding to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, but I think that that is the point."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.512,1819.332,"Well, getting back to the whether or not, they have to admit, or whether they could exclude nonresidents."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1837.996,1846.802,"Well, I think first of all, Mr. Justice Marshall, those are not the facts presented in this case, but the question then would be first of all how do you establish residency?"
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1847.561,1851.442,"Well, I want to know what constitutional points are you talking about?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1856.993,1858.394,As a nonresident?
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1858.394,1860.468,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1862.36,1867.137,I think Your Honor that that is a different legislative judgment on a one made here.
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.08,1887.101,Then you agree that maybe Connecticut could do that?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1887.101,1899.502,"I would not say, I said that you'd have to look at the circumstances, at the amount of discrimination against whom they were trying to keep out, why."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.498,1918.356,You say that this regulation is unreasonable.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1920.951,1930.997,The present regulation is unreasonable in that it does not allow change in status.
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.997,1946.016,"But if Connecticut could exclude all people, except its own residents, in other words did not follow that it can allow nonresidents to come in on any terms that Connecticut wants to establish?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1946.016,1951.238,I think Mr Chief Justice that --
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.238,1960.514,"You don't seriously question to Connecticut could exclude all nonresidents from attendance on any terms, do you?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1960.514,1966.289,"I think Mr. Chief Justice the question is how do you determine residents, and is that determination irrational?"
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1966.289,1968.463,"Well, that's a factual question."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1982.808,1983.24,No I don't concede that.
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1983.24,1983.392,Oh!
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1983.87,1984.296,"No, I don't."
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1993.948,1999.803,What provision of the constitution would prohibit Connecticut from excluding all nonresidents?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,1999.803,2013.499,"I think that the privileges in the Immunities Clause would prohibit them from excluding all nonresidents unless they show -- unless they could show particular reason why, and substantiate it on the basis in fact on the record."
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.118,2060.952,"That is the standard, that's the new standard --"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2060.952,2061.405,The new standard.
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2061.405,2062.632,-- since the decision --
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2062.632,2063.395,Since the decision.
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.395,2064.288,-- of a district court.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2064.288,2064.572,Of the district court.
1972.72-493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.572,2065.185,Right.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2066.63,2124.809,"The Attorney General opinion, yes, and that's a relevant criteria for determining that status in-state or out of state, resident or nonresident a or b, include year on residents, voter registration, place of filling tax returns, property ownership, driver's license, Connecticut registration, marital status, vacation and employment plan and not only the present system, a student comes in and fills out and affidavit, you may ask him, what is your parent's address, who has custody of you if your parents are separated, what is your age, what is your address, what is your marital status, all high schools and colleges that you have attended with their addresses, military service, periods and other service, voter registration, driver's license, automobile registration, and provides that falsification for this to be grounds for expulsion."
1972.72-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.29,2192.04,But when you have an irrebuttable presumption you are no longer dealing with a method of proving something else.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2221.9,2228.593,"Yes, when I think that those requirements are unconstitutional that in that they affect a penalty on the right to travel."
1972.72-493,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2231.373,2234.493,May I ask a question in that connection?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2261.153,2268.082,"If that person, excuse me, if that person does not intend to become a resident per se, bona fide nonresident, yes."
1972.72-493,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2268.082,2285.97,"So let's assume for the moment a bona fide nonresident, but the day arrives is confronted by a very wide differential in fee, say 5 times as high, the day he arrives, he says I want to become a citizen of Connecticut from there on."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2285.97,2286.717,A resident.
1972.72-493,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2286.717,2289.821,"A resident, yes."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2308.385,2312.706,Then I think that the individual increase and one that's going to bring out this --
1972.72-493,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2312.706,2318.477,"But you come back basically to whether or not there is a restriction on the right to travel, that's your constitutional basis?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2318.477,2319.029,Yes.
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.287,2371.997,"But Connecticut says, you can do everything, including becoming the Mayor of Hartford."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2375.388,2376.029,Well I think --
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.029,2385.365,"You can become a resident and you get a right to vote and a right to run for public office and incidentally a right to pay taxes, you get all those rights."
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2385.365,2389.27,And you don't get any reduction in that obligation either.
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.27,2392.807,I don't see whether your argument covers that.
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2395.243,2402.295,"Well, he is also bearing all of the burdens, in that is he doesn't get a reduction in his sales and use tax."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.295,2409.961,"Well Connecticut interferes with my right to travel at least twice a year, I have pay gasoline tax when I go through there, but I mean that's --"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2409.961,2412.407,"Well, that is going through that is not staying there and live."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.407,2413.947,Well I stay there sometimes?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2413.947,2416.376,But you do not consider Connecticut your home.
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.376,2421.25,"I am wondering about that you are putting all of your eggs in the right to travel basket, that is what I am worried about?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2421.25,2428.094,"No I thank you to statute is in firm even under rational basis test, given the proffered purposes by the State."
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.094,2435.025,"Well, are you going to get to the unreasonable and the irrational point any time in your argument?"
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2435.025,2447.526,I thought I covered that Mr. Justice Marshall by saying that the state has put forth the reasons why.
1972.72-493,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.943,2455.976,That's the states interest point but what is the unreasonable point?
1972.72-493,1,29939,john_a_dziamba,,2455.976,2485.962,"The unreasonable point I think you said there is no way of establishing residency for a particular purpose and I think that, that is unreasonable that if you are bona fide resident of state Connecticut for any and all purposes and you are paying all the benefits, you are paying all the burdens of taxation, why that particular benefit, why not exclude you from the hospitals, why not exclude you from this state highways, why not exclude you from the public libraries?"
1972.72-493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.746,2506.258,"Mr. Hill, do you have anything further?"
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2506.258,2518.974,"I will just make one brief comment Your Honor and it is really I am not re-arguing the legal points in this, I think some of the questions pointed out some of the seriousness of this problem and the affects of it."
1972.72-493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2544.326,2547.797,(Inaudible)
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2547.797,2550.067,I do not think any has exactly the same but.
1972.72-493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2550.067,2555.85,(Inaudible)
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2555.85,2560.34,I think most state do have durational requirements Mr. Justice.
1972.72-493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.939,2572.193,(Inaudible)
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2572.193,2579.044,It applies as long as they are taking -- the student is taking less than six credits at the state institution.

1972.72-493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.079,2605.158,Those are the states have statute –-
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2605.158,2610.92,It can never be changed as long as the student is in attendance at the institution and taking a certain number of credits.

1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2613.064,2614.19,"Yes, Your Honor I think it was."
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.471,2631.422,Let us suppose a family moves to Connecticut.
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2667.657,2668.42,That is correct.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.42,2673.92,Now tell me that what is the explanation between those two just under the Equal Protection Clause?
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2673.92,2679.95,You have put your finger specifically on the part of the statute where there are problems raised.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.433,2686.427,Everything --
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2686.427,2688.314,Any classification you have --
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.314,2690.434,But how about the constitutionality?
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2690.434,2696.717,I think its constitutional on the ground that this is a reasonable method for classification.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.786,2719.995,"Well this is a, the one in this case is a woman who is married to a Connecticut man, is that right?"
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2726.67,2731.827,She would have had no hardship except she was caught while a law was in period of flex.
1972.72-493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.077,2753.932,"Though she applied as a single woman, from out of state and then almost very soon they are after marriage moved to Connecticut?"
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2753.932,2754.387,That's correct.
1972.72-493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.387,2758.466,In fact it is a very similar case to Justice White's hypothetical case?
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2758.466,2761.58,But had she married before moving to Connecticut that would have been no problem.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.542,2779.922,"But the woman who married the other couple who were married before they move there, that woman gets in-state fees, right?"
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2779.922,2782.358,I am sorry Your Honor.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.906,2787.782,"Mrs. Linus (ph) does not get in-state tuition because she applied as a single woman, is it that?"
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2787.782,2789.488,"No, no, no."
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.488,2791.514,Because she applied as a single woman?
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2791.514,2792.889,No this is what interesting Your Honor.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.345,2818.975,But if she had married and moved to Connecticut before she applied --
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2818.975,2819.633,She would have been alright.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.633,2820.818,Been there one day.
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2820.818,2821.84,That is correct.
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.84,2823.4,But she applied from out of state.
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2823.4,2825.88,"That is correct, but you see --"
1972.72-493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.88,2826.981,That is --
1972.72-493,2,31019,john_g_hill_jr,,2826.981,2829.228,"Well, that is not so bad you see if you stopped to think."
