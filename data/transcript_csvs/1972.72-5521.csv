1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.043,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-5521, Strunk against the United States."
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,32.56,36.292,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,186.108,189.24,How long after the indictment did that occur?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,189.24,190.04,This is pre-indictment.
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,190.04,190.682,This is pre-indictment.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,190.682,197.623,This is pre-indictment Mr. Chief Justice Wright and we are raising no issue as to pre-indictment delay but I want to give a broad statement of facts.
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,311.024,324.152,Is it correct that an about 2-1/2 months more or less was delayed by reason of this discussion of plea of nolo contendere?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,324.152,325.156,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.731,381.596,May I just add.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,388.61,391.154,It is suggested in their brief Your Honor and --
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.154,395.414,I thought all they were saying was the assuming arguendo.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,398.359,403.012,The challenge Your Honor I find in their brief.
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.012,405.542,That they have -- they didn’t cross-petition.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,405.542,406.655,They did not cross-petition Your Honor.
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.655,411.687,I don’t read their question presented as suggesting that they challenge our holding.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,411.687,438.574,"However, I got an impression on page 12 Your Honor in their brief at footnote 10 where I will quote “If this Court should conclude on a balance of the four factors in Barker that the present circumstances and explain 10 months delay resulting in virtually no prejudice do not establish a speedy trial violation etcetera” that struck me as -- I was impressed at that point Your Honor that they were urging re-examination of those issues and --"
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.574,440.343,I just don’t see how they can.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,440.343,441.135,"I don’t either, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.135,442.095,No cross-petition.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,446.727,449.011,"The argument is not very long at all, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,485.14,488.906,And were they referring to Nebraska’s incarceration of him?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,488.906,492.793,"No the federal incarceration, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,495.358,500.067,"He was in the Nebraska State Penitentiary awaiting trial, was he not?"
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,500.067,501.828,"No, he was in the penitentiary."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.909,505.235,Yes but he was in Nebraska’s custody.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,505.235,507.371,"He was in Nebraska’s custody, yes."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,507.371,513.606,Now did the Court of Appeals think this was an oppressive custody on him.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,513.606,517.404,"They view this as oppressive incarceration yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.404,522.707,But did that rest on an independent conviction in the State of Nebraska in the state courts?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,522.707,527.368,"No, it rested on the language in Smith versus Hooey, in that --"
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,527.368,539.453,"No, I’m speaking of the custody -- Nebraska’s custody of this man before trial was based upon a conviction in Nebraska for a state defense in the state courts or have I misread the record?"
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,539.453,542.507,"No, that is correct Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,542.507,547.943,But the Court of Appeals viewed that as an oppressive custody in the context of the federal case.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,547.943,559.931,"They did Your Honor, in the sense that, although he was lawfully imprisoned he was running the risk of losing substantial concurrent time."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.312,568.428,"That would be on an assumption that sentence was going to be concurrent, wouldn’t it?"
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,568.428,569.734,"Yes, it would be Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.862,571.742,But no one knew that there is a chance.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,571.742,582.41,There would be no way to know and I submit that the language in Smith versus Hooey where it points out that the possibility of loss of concurrent time is what the court really meant in that respect.
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,864.694,896.031,With your -- in your view if in fact the prosecutor assigned a higher priority to take their terms to people who were being held in custody without bond waiting trial would you consider that an invalid priority assignment as compared with this man in a state prison under conviction in another charge.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,896.031,916.737,"Your Honor, I find -- I’m sorry a system of priorities in this area to be totally repugnant and I submit this because it work such a gross unfairness to a defendant to have his case relegated to a low priority."
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.737,927.164,"Well, I’m just asking you whether in your view it would the – any priority would be invalid at all."
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,927.164,943.444,"I am not saying that -- what I think I’m trying to say, Your Honor is that and I’m not avoiding your question, is that we have a problem today that all of us recognize in terms of the effective administration of criminal justice."
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,983.555,992.527,"Mr. Wideikis, you have repeatedly referred to undue and oppressive incarceration."
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,996.554,997.674,Oppressive.
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,997.674,1000.906,Incarceration anymore oppressive than anybody in the other person.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1000.906,1006.419,I think the language I have used Mr. Justice Blackmun comes from the decision in Smith versus Hooey.
1972.72-5521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.145,1055.213,You’re talking about the passage quoted at here on top of page 11 of your brief I assume.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1055.213,1055.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1055.699,1064.22,"Which in Smith against Hooey quoted that language, I think, from the Ewell case if I’m not mistaken undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial?"
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1064.22,1065.978,"That came from Ewell, yes Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.636,1071.918,Right.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1071.918,1083.028,Now while the remedy of absolute discharge is severe it is no more severe than what a finding of a denial of a speedy trial right asserts.
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1120.24,1126.166,And yet we’ve always spoken of prejudice in connection with the speedy trial.
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1133.171,1135.685,Nothing more than that Your Honor that was it.
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1135.685,1141.978,And did not the Seventh Circuit result to render on to him that denial?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1141.978,1145.402,Exactly what the Government take it the court can give it back.
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1226.616,1231.099,Do you feel that you’re not attacking endlessly Mr. Barker against Wingo in anyway?
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1231.099,1231.292,Oh!
1972.72-5521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1234.778,1237.448,"Precisely, in fact on that case?"
1972.72-5521,0,33427,john_r_wideikis,,1237.448,1237.988,Oh!
1972.72-5521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1272.833,1273.864,Thank you.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1275.73,1279.843,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1290.222,1291.23,Excuse me Mr. Reynolds.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1297.586,1300.236,"Your Honor, I think that this Court could appropriately --"
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1300.236,1302.448,Do you think we took the case for that purpose.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1302.448,1304.485,I don’t believe you didn’t take the case for that purposes.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.161,1311.362,"If we want it -- you mean, if we want to avoid deciding the issue for which we took it."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1311.362,1312.12,That’s correct.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.12,1315.741,And you responsibly never suggested that to the petition for certiorari.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1315.741,1316.422,"No that’s, that’s --"
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1316.422,1318.894,And you never filed any cross-petition.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1318.894,1320.671,"We didn’t -- that’s, that’s true we did not file."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1320.671,1326.407,And while you are doing you’re just saying we don’t have to decide the question because they were wrong anyway on the holding.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1326.407,1329.172,I think that this Court could properly make that decision.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1329.172,1332.055,"Well, you’re urging us to do it, aren’t you?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1332.055,1339.099,"Well, we do address ourselves in our main brief to the principal issue and we did not as you might now."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1339.099,1344.116,Why would we have taken the case if that was the disposition we made of it?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1344.116,1349.635,"Well, Your Honor, I’m not sure that we can anticipate the disposition that the Court’s going to make."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1351.728,1355.595,"We have enough things to do, I should suggest."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1355.595,1362.4,"Well, I planned to address myself to the issue of the remedy."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.896,1858.956,"Mr. Reynolds, this -- what you’re saying is that very rational justification for the action of the Court of Appeals in this case but of course as Justice, my brother Brennan has indicated when we grant certiorari in a case genteelly under the -- if our rules were taken seriously its because the issue has emanations beyond the four corners of the particular case."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1882.644,1887.717,I’m -- I am saying Your Honor that in appropriate cases that may well be appropriate relief.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.191,1922.203,"Well, you can’t see all of those factors until after a trial and yet Barker against Wingo as you and I both know is at the basic remedy for denial of a speedy trial is not going to be any trial."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1922.203,1926.784,"Well, of course the determination in Barker versus Wingo is also before a trial."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.126,1945.169,I just read the motion here and I suppose it was prepared by the -- was it prepared pro se?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1945.169,1946.392,"I believe that was counsel, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.392,1946.761,"Well, you say --"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1946.761,1947.477,It was prepared by counsel.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.477,1954.918,"What I thought, maybe I think it was pres – prepared pros se was he said he didn’t have access to Smith against Hooey."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1960.885,1964.752,It had been -- if this motion was prepared by a counsel.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.752,1966.008,By counsel.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1967.41,1969.047,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1969.047,1981.861,But he sets out all sorts of reasons in support of his claim that to try this man would be to deny his right to a speedy trial and he asked that the indictment therefore be dismissed.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2028.26,2056.556,"Your Honor, I think a district court is able to look at the various factors such as prejudice such as what the reasons for the delay was and including a personal prejudice as discussed in Marian and Wingo and to assess on the basis of what is claimed whether or not you can appropriately cure the prejudice by granting relief less drastic then dismissal that I think."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.556,2063.583,The denial was of a constitutional right and then you’re -- you have a right not to be tried except on a speedy trial.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2064.328,2065.525,"That, that is correct."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.525,2076.712,"And how can a district judge agreeing with the defendant’s claim that to try him would be a denial of a speedy trial, how can he deny the motion and that’s what your telling us he ought to do."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2076.712,2085.572,"Your Honor, I think that district judges often when you have a denial of a constitutional right allow a case to go to trial and they remedy it by other means."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.518,2099.995,"Do you think double jeopardy would be the same that if a district judge agreed that to try her again would to be to put you twice in jeopardy, you should nonetheless let you be tried and see how it comes out?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2099.995,2121.996,No because I think that you’re talking about the type of prejudice in that situation or right to counsel or coerce -- let me have exclude coerce confession because that’s a little different situation but there you’re talking about a situation where your prejudice is directly to whether or not the defendant can obtain a fair trial.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.467,2127.877,Although jeopardy has nothing to do with the fair trial at all.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2127.877,2137.74,"Well, it’s whether or not it would whether fundamental fairness would permit putting this man to trial a second time for the same offense."
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.156,2158.927,I’m still puzzled as to what District Courts are going to do if your --
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2158.927,2167.281,But we’re not talking about some broad expensive exemption to the remedy of the dismissal.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.373,2216.733,"Well, Mr. Reynolds, tell me what happens if a motion is made to dismiss the indictment in the grounds of denial of speedy trial?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2229.517,2230.917,"No, Your Honor, what we are suggesting --"
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2230.917,2235.298,"Well, just take what’s likely to be ordinary situation."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2254.745,2261.445,"Well, I think that that would be impermissible under the rule that we’re suggesting here."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2278.731,2283.207,"Well, what happen in my -- how in my situation I put this."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2283.207,2283.617,Well I think the courts can --
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2283.617,2285.101,What can the district judge do?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2285.101,2294.779,"A district judge, just can I believe to further question of speedy trial until after trial if there’s some question on the prejudicial question that’s been done before and then rule it on there."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.779,2301.209,"I don’t know, I don’t know, but my hypothesis is if he finds there’s been a denial of speedy trial."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2307.856,2310.822,And he does not feel that that they can be sure --
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2310.822,2313.21,An inside value have been denied a speedy trial but I think you’re going to trial anyway.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2313.21,2314.964,But I’m going to disregard it.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2319.177,2320.242,"Well, let’s see."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2336.781,2343.051,"No, it’s relevant as to what the basis for the determination of a speedy trial violation is."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.683,2353.762,"All right, let’s take this very case because in this case the indictment was not dismissed by the trial judge he went to trial for it."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2353.762,2359.865,I think that the trial judge in this case could have affected the same remedy that the Court of Appeals did here.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2359.865,2366.466,"Well, he could have only done it though could he not by holding it there was no denial of speedy trial"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2366.466,2369.848,"No, I think that he could have held that we will allow this case to go to trial."
1972.72-5521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.706,2411.874,I could understand Mr. Reynolds your position if your were saying that the district judge reach the conclusion that this is a very close question and I can’t -- he says to himself “I can’t decide it right now I’m going to let it go to trial and if I conclude that there was no denial that there was a problem about the case perhaps deal with this remedial device.”
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2425.321,2432.949,Well that basic constitutional question is going to be decided the same way as this Court suggested in Barker versus Wingo.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.949,2437.838,"Well, what is the constitutional right -- I’m sorry I apologize."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2437.954,2440.449,"Well, I -- I think --"
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.449,2443.602,"No, you finish I’ve interrupted you and I apologize."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2443.602,2457.718,My answer is I think that the court just as a court if it finds a violation under the Forth Amendment that the District Court can cure that violation by excluding the evidence and allowing the case to go to trial.
1972.72-5521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2468.719,2478.368,But that assumes that are multiple remedies for the denial of a speedy trial and not just one remedy.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2478.368,2483.416,That’s right Your Honor appropriate cases there can be a remedy other than dismissal.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2490.763,2501.31,But Mr. Reynolds what possible remedy can there be other than dismissal except some kind of amelioration of the penalty imposed if there’s a conviction.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2503.636,2505.751,"Well, here is a remedy that."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.751,2511.893,Well I know but what -- take what’s going to be the usual situation not the peculiar facts of this case?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2524.868,2527.325,And there’s going to be a factual hearing on that on the basis.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2527.325,2530.923,And there’s going to be determination for the denial of a speedy trial.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2550.435,2553.313,In this case the court takes care of it.
1972.72-5521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.268,2567.655,"Well, why don’t just say that the judge could say “there’s been no prejudice to your trial, to your defense but you’ve been denied the right to conquer it, and there’s been a denial."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2571.837,2578.112,That’s what I’ve been trying to say but I understand Mr. Justice Brennan I was trying to get away from this case.
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.112,2584.008,"You can’t say that if the constitutional right is a right not be trialed, isn’t that correct?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2584.008,2591.357,"Well, I think that that’s if there is an -- if the speedy trial right means and absolutely nobody can be tried and there must be --"
1972.72-5521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.357,2608.955,Except by -- except in a speedy trial and isn’t that the constitutional right the basic right and if it is what choice does the district judge have if he is convinced that too much time and pressures has taken place since the indictment except to dismiss if the right is a right not to be tried?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2608.955,2614.846,But I don’t think Your Honor that the constitutional right is an absolute one that requires dismissal of the indictment whenever a violation is found.
1972.72-5521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.846,2626.647,"Well, Mr. Reynolds part of the purpose of the -- hasn’t the part of the purpose though have been defined to prevent oppressive incarceration."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2626.647,2629.827,"I think that that’s right, oppressive or undue pretrial incarceration."
1972.72-5521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.827,2633.352,[Voice Overlap] is to prevent an unfair trial.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2633.352,2637.638,That’s right but if you have near those situations in law.
1972.72-5521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.638,2644.558,"But what if you have one of them, oppressive incarceration but no proof of any prejudice to a fair trial?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2644.558,2657.685,"Well, I think in those circumstances if you have for example if you have a demand by the accused and it was not adhered to, the dismissal would be perhaps the appropriate remedy in that situation."
1972.72-5521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.685,2678.821,"Well, are you are saying that since the only prejudice that could conceivably result in a Smith-Hooey type or this type of case goes to the length of confinement that in that particular case, you carve out a special remedy and you deal with the delay by the special remedy, is that your argument?"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2678.821,2694.871,"That – yes, Your Honor, that’s what we’re saying that in that factual situation that this remedy is an appropriate one and that it does cure the prejudice resulting from the delay."
1972.72-5521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2694.871,2705.235,"Perhaps, you can inherent in your position as the idea that there may be some delays which are not quite constitutional but ought to be remedied."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2709.284,2728.767,Well we -- and that of course goes back to why we did present the argument of Mr. Justice Brennan that this factual situation was one where I think that prior to Barker versus Wingo that the courts would not have found a speedy trial violation on the facts of this case.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2736.304,2745.581,"It’s not, Mr. Reynolds, I forgot does your brief cite us any cases where there having been a finding of a denial of speedy trial."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2748.804,2750.024,"No Your Honor, it does not."
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2750.024,2752.177,This is the first time [Voice Overlap].
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2752.177,2759.574,I do not know of any and I think that at the Barker versus Wingo is one of the main reasons why we have this development.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2759.574,2779.927,"You know other things that concerns me is if what you’re proposing whether become the rule, what happens in the most in Metropolitan Districts where motions are heard by one judge and he finds a denial of a speedy trial but the trial itself was before another judge, he don’t have to sentence."
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2779.927,2791.938,I think that the -- if the judge who hears the motion for instance in this particular case had ordered that there would be credit given that the sentencing judge would have to adhere with that order.
1972.72-5521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2791.938,2798.215,Would he be bound by order.
1972.72-5521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2798.215,2802.76,How could one judge give a motion by the trial judge?
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2802.76,2815.11,"Well, because he’s ruled as matter of constitutional law that the way to redress the speedy trial violation and the only appropriate way is to give him credit on the sentence."
1972.72-5521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.482,2836.69,So how different from interfering with a trial judge’s discretion to sentence.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2839.474,2842.374,"Well, I -- but I don’t think that, I think here you got a ruling --"
1972.72-5521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.374,2846.268,"I think the technicality of it, I just don’t I mean I just can’t --"
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2846.268,2853.26,I think they would be bound by the prior constitutional ruling of district judge who heard the motion.
1972.72-5521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.26,2865.677,Can we really be sure that this remedy and right business is as watertight as some of the discussions indicated as a practical matter if the Seventh Circuit hadn’t thought it to had this discretion.
1972.72-5521,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2869.837,2881.968,"Well, it indicates that that’s one of the dangers that the courts are feeling that the remedy is so severe might be inclined not defined a speedy trial violation."
1972.72-5521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.729,2903.934,Thank you Mr. Reynolds.
