1967.158,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,58.393,"Number 158, Fleming Smith, Petitioner, versus Illinois."
1967.158,0,25409,gerald_w_getty,,61.476,66.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1573.277,1576.991,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1753.416,1753.729,Just suppose you could --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1753.729,1756.896,"Mr. O'Toole, may I --"
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1756.896,1764.319,"Suppose you put him on the stand and put a mask, a hood on his head, is that alright?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1764.319,1765.775,"No, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1765.775,1767.227,What's the difference?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1767.227,1769.166,I think there's a big difference.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1769.166,1770.492,"That's what I want to know, what's that big difference?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1770.492,1772.222,Alright.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1779.481,1781.744,(Inaudible)
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1781.744,1783.233,The defendant?
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1783.233,1784.868,That he came in contact with.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1784.868,1789.907,That he came in contact with (Inaudible) -- on a controlled sale of narcotics.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1792.456,1806.904,"But suppose you didn't see him at all.Suppose the transaction was such in which he just passed the money through a crack in the door or the window, and the narcotics was passed to him, then it'd be alright."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1809.923,1818.166,"I think this -- that if gestational features are not necessary for the defense of the defendant, yes, I think you could put a mask."
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1818.166,1837.559,"Could it be alright to have in the Courts of the United States or state courts, persons taking the witness stand wearing a black hood with holes except for their eyes and a hole kept for his mouth and so he testifies in that fashion, do you really take that position?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1837.559,1841.677,"No, I can't really take that position Mr. Justice, right."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1841.677,1845.728,"Mr. O'Toole, let me ask you this question."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1863.027,1863.083,Oh!
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1863.083,1872.853,"-- or are you asking us for (Inaudible) of that in your case, you'd still be here?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1872.853,1886.924,We think that this is a very important factor in this case to point out and emphasize the fact that it was not necessary in this case for the state to divulge in the present address and true identity of this informant.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1888.917,1895.86,"Well, let me ask you then if it's important in this case, let me ask you."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1902.56,1905.166,"Yes, I don't think -- that is a controlling factor."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1905.166,1911.6,You don't' think it makes any difference constitutionally whether he knew him or not?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1911.6,1914.879,"Oh, I think it adds great weight to our argument --"
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1914.879,1915.059,But --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1915.059,1915.385,-- but I think --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1915.385,1931.338,"But you wanted -- you want an opinion from this Court to the effect that not with -- that even if the counsel had not known this man at all, that you would still have had the right to do what you did in this case?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1931.338,1952.967,"Yes, we do not contend that together with the fact of his destroyed credibility, the corroboration of his testimony and the fact that the attorney knew him, all three of these add to it but we can take away to one and we still have sufficient reason to say --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.967,1961.237,"Well, why do you want to -- what interest does the state got in this?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1961.237,1967.501,"The interest of the State of Illinois is, one, to protect the informant's situation and the informant --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.501,1970.267,But wasn't he still known as Jordan?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1970.267,1971.557,That was an alias.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.557,1976.004,"Oh, I know but wasn't he known as Jordan up and down the street?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1976.004,1977.189,This I can't say.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.911,1982.941,When he testified (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1982.941,1984.132,And he testified that this was his name.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.132,1986.445,"In other cases as Jordan, isn't it?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1986.445,1988.986,He did not say that he testified under that same name.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.986,1991.224,"Well, he must have been known like something up and down the street?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1991.471,1992.577,"Oh, they know who he was."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.932,1996.09,"Well, but, what name was he known by?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2006.155,2006.593,Right.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.593,2012.747,Once you -- and that's usually why you store up to 20 cases before you put them on the stand.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2012.747,2013.06,"Well, this is --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.06,2025.617,"And once he comes out, then the people who know it and especially if he testifies under a name that he's known by up and down the street, that's -- I don't know what the --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2025.617,2025.916,Well --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.916,2027.576,I wonder how much interest the states (Voice Overlap)?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2027.576,2038.886,"Let me say this that as far as the informant's situation goes, that once an individual does expose himself in court, he is open for retaliation."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.437,2077.286,But don't you think the witness should be forced whether he's an informer or not to give his address?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2077.286,2080.368,"If it's necessary for the defense, yes."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.735,2087.303,"Yes, but that's (Voice Overlap) -- if automatically if a state's witness was asked his address."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2098.1,2101.064,"Under normal circumstances, I would say perfectly right."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.064,2102.685,How about this circumstance?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2102.685,2105.943,"In this circumstance, I'd say definitely no."
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2105.943,2106.199,Do you think a --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.199,2107.138,You could say --
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2107.138,2108.753,I beg your pardon.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.753,2117.797,"You could say that -- what you could really say is that this fellow, you shouldn't have to give any name whatsoever?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2117.797,2119.786,I think an alias.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2120.121,2121.008,What is your answer to that?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2121.008,2122.228,Excuse me.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2122.228,2125.238,What is your answer to what Justice White just said?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2125.238,2127.236,I haven't answered it yet Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.236,2127.793,"Well, your case --"
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2127.793,2129.764,"You said something, I just (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.764,2143.554,"-- you would -- I gather that you would say that when a state puts on a witness and that they don't need to ask him his name and if he's asked his name on a cross-examination, he doesn't need to give any at all, nor his address?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2143.554,2148.061,Unless it was necessary for the defense -- for the defendant.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.871,2160.609,"Well, that -- is that enough to be -- to make it necessary that the defense would like to know who he is so that they could check on his criminal record --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2160.609,2160.886,And I say that --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.886,2166.72,"-- under his right name, is it enough that they could check on his reputation in the neighborhood?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2166.72,2168.171,For truth and veracity?
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.171,2168.676,Yes.
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.676,2168.81,Is it the --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2168.81,2169.962,Here is a man (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.962,2173.904,Is that enough to make it necessary for the defense?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2173.904,2176.048,But it depends upon the circumstances
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.048,2176.333,And he --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2176.333,2176.575,He not --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2176.575,2180.112,"I know, but you don't want to bring in these other things now."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.946,2203.872,Can he say John Doe (Voice Overlap)?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2203.872,2207.809,But he also justifies that I'm a convicted felon.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.87,2209.312,Yes.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2211.27,2212.725,I am presently under indictment.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.183,2229.909,"You might found that, you might find out that -- you might find out that he had a lot of fights with this defendant and was out to get him."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2233.613,2239.829,I think we had a lot of fights with the defendant was that the defendant can tell us the answer.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2239.829,2239.918,Let me --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2239.918,2240.718,(Inaudible) he may have some --
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2240.718,2244.715,"-- will you assume for a moment, (Inaudible)."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2244.715,2245.238,Go ahead.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2245.238,2264.672,"Will you assume for a moment that you are a counsel for Mr. Smith in this criminal case, regardless of what you might know about a witness, is it or is it not your duty as a lawyer to make an investigation of that witness?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2264.672,2265.516,"Yes, that's --"
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2265.516,2284.262,"Now how can you make that investigate -- if that is so that the fact that this lawyer knew something is immaterial, how can a lawyer discharge his duty to his client to make an investigation if he doesn't know the witness' name?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2284.262,2300.849,"The point that is in this case is that the name and address can lead to only one thing, destruction of credibility and that in this instance, it was not necessary because its credibility was shattered as far as it could possibly go."
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2300.849,2304.263,"Well, that -- lawyers don't operate that way."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2327.269,2331.991,"There are rules, and privileges, and rights that exist with the people too."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.624,2356.392,Even after you produce him in court?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2356.392,2357.673,"Yes, I'd say."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.448,2361.476,"Well, why didn't --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2361.476,2362.999,-- the system is going to breakdown.
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.999,2372.235,"Do you go for a system that would say you put the witness on the stand and he says, “My name is John Doe.”"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2372.235,2374.765,"Yes, if --"
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.765,2375.594,And do you say that this --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2375.594,2377.894,"His true name is not necessary for his defense, I submit (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.894,2382.216,You say that his credibility couldn't be further destroyed?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2382.501,2385.016,"Oh, I think it would be cumulative -- any evidence that was (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.016,2394.613,"Well, what about they get his right name and they found he's been convicted of perjury, that would hurt a little more, wouldn't it?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2394.613,2397.877,"I think that'll hurt a little bit more but it's cumulative, really."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.487,2407.189,"Well, I think if you --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2407.189,2409.025,We're trying to protect the system.
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.025,2420.674,"I would respectfully suggest that if you're balancing rights, when you first put him on the stand, you should have told the Court that this man's name is not James Jordan."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2420.674,2425.367,"I agree with you that its -- that if perhaps it was an alias, I can see no harm in it at all."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.367,2428.42,But don't you think your duty bound to do that?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2434.301,2435.017,"Yes, I agree."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.775,2444.605,"I mean, you're balancing these things and then you balance them all under the (Inaudible)."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2444.605,2457.345,A situation that is similarly akin to this is a situation of where a person might invoke the right of self-incrimination in a trial.
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2489.953,2494.299,You don't really mean that there's no distinction between two of those cases?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2494.299,2495.528,"Oh, I think there's a little distinction there."
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2495.528,2496.48,A little --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2496.48,2496.612,I think that --
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2496.612,2497.343,A little.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2497.343,2498.668,I think that --
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2498.668,2500.122,"Oh, heavens."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2500.122,2503.336,I think that there's a corollary between the two.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.86,2508.945,"I think that's quite a difference, isn't it?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2508.945,2509.583,Right.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2527.8,2543.57,Are there not cases where a defendant or a witness on the stand rather has been convicted of contempt and put into jail for refusing to tell what his name is or where he lives?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2543.57,2544.82,There are.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2544.82,2548.546,Then how do you distinguish those cases from this?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2550.852,2556.353,Even though he claims -- the situation is not the same.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2558.393,2560.9,"Why not, a witness is a witness, isn't he?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2560.9,2561.663,That's right Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2561.663,2568.37,"And whether he's a witness for the government or a witness for the defendant, isn't that right?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2568.37,2568.582,That's right Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2568.582,2575.343,"And whether he's an informant or whether he's just an observer, he's a witness, as a witness, --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2575.343,2575.365,Right.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.365,2576.278,-- isn't he?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2576.278,2576.344,Right.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2576.344,2578.317,"Alright then, what's the distinction?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2578.317,2596.907,The distinction is here is that you and I and the other 200 million people in this country collectively have a privilege to protect the informant's situation unless it is necessary for the defense of this individual defendant.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.907,2597.922,How do you prove that?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2614.531,2616.612,What has -- the defendant here --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.612,2623.435,"I suppose, if you could make that showing, why, your answer would be, “Well, you don't need to cross-examine him anyway”."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2624.599,2625.978,No.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.608,2658.692,"Well, if --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2658.692,2666.305,"The Court said this, “We believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable”."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.821,2711.832,What's wrong with --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2711.832,2714.646,"And anything that he do, it just pile more to it."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.646,2718.28,But nobody has unfettered cross-examination rights anyway.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2718.28,2722.858,"Well, I'm -- excuse me for going beyond the realm."
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.42,2757.627,But you don't want a rule then -- it says that an informant never has to give his name (Inaudible).
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2757.627,2758.087,No.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.691,2802.256,"Well, why shouldn't the states -- why shouldn't -- it should be on the other foot, if the states are going to serve this -- an informant and put him on the bench, so why shouldn't the state have to come up and give some pretty solid reason if it wants to interfere with what -- what the words would be cross-examination, “What's your name and where do you live?”"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2816.239,2825.008,"Oh, I -- oh, perhaps I assumed too much but I thought this Court was well-aware of the fact that what does happen --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.008,2825.506,"Well, I'm well informed."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2837.991,2838.161,Correct.
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.161,2838.687,-- give his name.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2838.687,2839.247,I agree with --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.247,2841.766,I think you -- going to have to explain that a little bit as to why --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2841.766,2842.961,I agree with your point but (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.961,2851.529,But -- what -- how the hazard is enhanced when you make him give his name very especially when the --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2851.529,2852.593,All that --
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.593,2861.699,"-- when the fellow is obviously using a name by which he -- and gives a name by which he's known as up and down the street, Jordan."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2861.699,2864.072,Let's give him every break we can.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2865.457,2867.389,(Inaudible)
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2867.389,2872.294,"Oh, I mean try to hide his identity and his present whereabouts, let's do that --"
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.294,2872.832,Wherever he is (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2872.832,2874.17,(Inaudible)
1967.158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.17,2876.226,Everybody knows where he is.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2876.226,2881.372,"Well, he's in the courtroom now, but where is he's going to be at 5 o'clock or 10 o'clock tonight."
1967.158,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2894.887,2903.247,"He changed it when he testified three or four times, he just makes a habit of testifying?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2903.247,2906.531,"I don't think he could buy an insurance policy Your Honor, that's for sure."
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2930.593,2941.976,What about a prosecutor who puts a person on the stand and permits him to give a false -- a name that is false in which the prosecutor knows it's false?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2941.976,2944.028,I think he should divulge in the Court.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2944.028,2946.736,"That wasn't done here, was it?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2946.736,2947.834,I know.
1967.158,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2947.834,2948.466,Sir?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2948.466,2949.744,I know that Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.363,2958.385,Do you mean that (Inaudible) of the prosecutor was brought out?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2958.385,2958.688,"No, no."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2959.725,2966.287,"Well, wasn't it (Inaudible) if they put a man on the stand and have him say that his name was Jordan but it wasn't Jordan."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2966.287,2969.97,Maybe the prosecutor thought that was his real name.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2975.221,2976.05,And if he thought it was --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2976.05,2976.177,-- he has to prosecute --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2976.177,2987.408,"-- his true name, -- if he thought it was his true name, why would he object to the defense asking him what his true name is?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2987.408,2991.415,Because to protect the identity of the informant.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2991.415,2998.153,"But if he thought it was his true name, why wouldn't he let him say, “Yes my true name is Jordan”."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2998.153,3006.408,He probably didn't want the petitioner to know who this man really was.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3006.408,3007.274,Do you --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3007.274,3007.443,I --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3007.443,3007.823,Alright.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3007.823,3018.416,"I know, Your Honor, it's -- I mean, here's the point, if were the prosecutor and the witness might tell me his name is James Jordan."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3023.668,3024.326,"Well, then you have --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3024.326,3025.972,-- especially an addict.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3025.972,3038.744,"By the same reasoning, you have no reason to believe that this man didn't tell the counsel for the defense that his name was Jordan when he represented him on a prior case?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3038.744,3051.961,I think we have to assume that Mr. Martwick conducted himself as a proper attorney in that -- therefore I have to assume at least that the -- he didn't know that James Jordan was not his actual name.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3051.961,3061.505,Then don't you assume also -- do you assume also that the counsel for the defense probably thought his name was Jordan too?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3061.505,3064.656,Counsel for the defense knew him.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3069.86,3070.773,Yes.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3070.939,3071.399,It's the fact (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3071.399,3092.952,"Is this another prosecutor really represent him when he was a paid agent, and an ex-convict charged with -- also charged with narcotics violations, and he in this preparation of the case wouldn't he know him just as well as the defense counsel would know him in representing him when he was charged with the crime?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3092.952,3095.394,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3106.835,3108.947,"Some lawyers do that too, --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3108.947,3108.989,In the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3108.989,3110.07,-- from police courts.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3113.386,3113.965,(Inaudible)
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3113.965,3118.225,They take them right out of this room and represent them and --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3118.225,3119.204,Right.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3163.235,3165.836,You're also vouching for the truth and what you're saying --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3165.836,3165.977,Right.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3165.977,3167.856,"-- so far is you know it, aren't his name?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3167.856,3169.003,That is right Your Honor.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3169.003,3169.918,Yes.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3176.874,3178.01,I think it affects his credibility.
1967.158,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3178.01,3178.041,The informant --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3178.041,3205.637,"Can I -- irrespective of the question of credibility, why isn't this man on the question of guilt or innocence entitled to know whether this man is Jordan and where he lives, and what his contact has been so far as this case is concerned?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3208.447,3210.331,"If it's going to help him, yes, he isn't."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3210.331,3211.29,I beg your pardon.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3211.29,3216.403,"If it is going to be of aid to the defendant, yes."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3230.509,3250.76,"Well, let's just suppose that there are two gangs of narcotics federation in Chicago, I guess that he is at that time, and suppose this man belong to one and this witness, Jordan belong to another."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3267.03,3267.954,"I think so Your Honor, but I think there's --"
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3267.954,3268.957,"Well, why (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3268.957,3271.235,I think there's only one --
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3271.235,3271.715,Let's --
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3271.715,3273.176,-- source of narcotics.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3273.176,3275.593,One source of narcotics in Chicago?
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3275.593,3276.32,I think so.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3276.32,3280.384,"Do you mean all -- it falls, all of it comes from one source --"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3280.384,3283.157,The seller on the street is normally an addict.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3294.375,3309.754,"You too, don't you know that it's not uncommon for one narcotics operator to even murder the other operators in the same business?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3309.754,3310.31,Yes.
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3310.31,3314.967,Or -- who are trying to takeover or who do have the major control of it.
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3318.448,3326.157,"Oh, I think it is -- I think the syndicate is the sole -- real supplier of narcotics."

1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3334.288,3335.985,"Yes, well, this is a small man."
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3340.91,3349.024,"This man was selling narcotics because he was supporting a habit and that's exactly why he was selling narcotics, Fleming Smith."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3349.024,3351.337,"A very, very small operator?"
1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3351.337,3355.555,"Right, I agree."

1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3405.212,3407.368,"Oh, I think the state would always take the position."
1967.158,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3410.597,3411.872,I didn't ask you that.

1967.158,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,3429.612,3433.495,I don't think it lies totally with the defense or with the prosecution.
