2001.00-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.574,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-1853, Akos Swierkiewicz v. Sorema."
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,14.992,42.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings up for review a fairly straightforward but nonetheless essential question as it applies to Federal practice and procedure, namely, whether or not notice pleading is sufficient with compliance with Rule 8(a)(2), or whether or not the rule requires some element of fact pleading to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss."
2001.00-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.214,144.56,"You don't deny that some facts have to be stated, do you?"
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,144.56,145.083,I do not.
2001.00-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.083,153.723,"I mean, can I come in just with a complaint that says, I have been unlawfully discriminated against by my employer, who is... and I name the employer."
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,153.723,166.336,"I think if you did not identify the adverse action, there would not be sufficient information alleged to be able to sustain a motion for dismissal."
2001.00-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.408,168.544,That was contained here?
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,169.008,170.123,--Absolutely.
2001.00-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.123,177.104,"--You would have to also allege, wouldn't you, that you were discriminated against because of your race, or because of your nationality?"
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,177.104,178.203,Absolutely.
2001.00-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.203,180.176,And you again say that was done here.
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,180.176,182.832,Five times in the complaint.
2001.00-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.894,272.027,"Mr. Goodman, why do you start with Conley v. Gibson rather than Dioguardi v. Durning."
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,273.942,284.518,"--Dioguardi is my favorite case, simply because it has been authored by then Judge and later Chief Judge Clark, who was the reporter for this Court's advisory committee."
2001.00-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.112,333.734,That's the leading case?
2001.00-1853,0,27109,harold_i_goodman,,336.944,337.2,--Well--
2001.00-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.2,337.2,--as opposed to one from the Second Circuit.
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1160.992,1179.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals in this case clearly erred in ruling that the pleadings, in this case the complaint, were insufficient."
2001.00-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.875,1197.056,"It was nine pages long, wasn't it?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1197.056,1197.931,"Yes, it was."
2001.00-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.931,1200.288,Can you necessarily say that's a short statement?
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1200.288,1215.414,"Well, obviously the length of the complaint will vary on the degree of complexity of the case, but I think that simply underscores the fact that this complaint was more than ample in setting forth the necessary elements of a complaint."
2001.00-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.331,1305.371,"Suppose a person simply feels... he's been fired, and he thinks his work was good, and the employer said it was bad, so he thinks, they couldn't have fired me because my work was bad."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1338.384,1340.304,You certainly do not automatically--
2001.00-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.304,1344.24,How could a judge refuse discovery on that... on these--
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1344.24,1349.691,"--Very simply, the complaint in this situation presents an issue of fact."
2001.00-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.31,1361.766,--But we're talking about discovery.
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1365.174,1380.816,"--It may be that a complete refusal of discovery is not appropriate, but what's important here is that Rule 16, which deals with pretrial conference, coupled with Rule 26, regulating discovery, and Rule 56, dealing with--"
2001.00-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.816,1395.734,"So then, what the Second Circuit is actually saying is, since the judge can't refuse discovery in my case, let's go back and look and see what the cause of action is, and the cause of action is such that my case doesn't really fall within it."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1402.278,1415.462,"--Well, I think that the problem the Second Circuit discerned is, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's very easy to allege discrimination and, in fact, it can sometimes be very difficult to prove it as well."
2001.00-1853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.963,1437.099,"Does the complaint, Mr. Minear, require you under the Federal rules to put in all the elements of a cause of action in order to survive a 12(b)(6) motion?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1437.099,1451.067,"--Your Honor, no, it does not, and in fact this was one of the aims of the advisory committee in 1938, when we revised the rule, to get away from the code practice of requiring the facts of the cause of action all be pleaded."
2001.00-1853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.947,1455.771,That's why these rules religiously avoid determining cause of action.
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1458.219,1463.595,"--That is exactly right, and I think that principle is clearly enough established to be Hornbook law."
2001.00-1853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.275,1468.96,May I ask you one question?
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1502.32,1528.171,"Well, if I can break down this question and answer it in several parts, first of all we agree it may well have been abuse of discretion for the district court to have considered this memorandum rather than converting the motion to summary judgment where questions of fact and... rather than having to take all the inferences, giving all of the inferences to the plaintiff, the facts could be waived with regard to the meaning of that memorandum."
2001.00-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.03,1557.995,"You'd have to allow discovery anyway before you could rule under 12(b)(6), right?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1557.995,1566.667,"Under the circumstances of considering this memorandum, I think it makes it very difficult not being included in discovery, and I that means that it should be converted to a summary judgment motion under Rule 12(b)(6)."
2001.00-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.667,1567.062,Yes.
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1584.454,1586.273,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2001.00-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.273,1611.089,"That's exactly what I meant, that you couldn't get rid of the case on the basis of summary judgment without allowing discovery, so there's basically no way to prevent being subjected to discovery on the basis of a claim by somebody who just suspects, with no reason to suspect, that he has been fired because he's Hungarian."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1611.089,1625.302,"I think that's not, strictly speaking, true in this sense, that the way Rule 56 is structured is that if the defendant makes the motion for summary judgment the plaintiff is under an obligation to come forward with the facts sufficient to indicate there's a triable issue."
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1629.75,1641.425,"Well, what is it that... how would you describe the standard that's binding on the plaintiff and his attorney for firing the complaint, going back to Justice Breyer's question?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1646.299,1648.145,"No, I don't think it's enough."
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.145,1649.937,It has to be well-founded suspicion.
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1657.537,1662.326,I think the benchmark for the complaint is whether it provides the employer fair notice of the action.
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.11,1672.406,"What is the standard of confidence, the standard of belief that the plaintiff and the attorney must have before starting the action?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1672.406,1675.766,"--I think that's set forth in Rule 11, and that requires a good faith belief--"
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1675.766,1677.302,A good faith belief?
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1677.302,1680.395,"--Yes, a good faith belief that there are facts to support the action."
2001.00-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.187,1685.302,"Well, you could have a good faith belief that is entirely erroneous."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1694.55,1700.641,"--Well, this is the important role that the lawyer and the officer of the court plays in policing these efforts."
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1703.185,1716.086,"Well, doesn't he have to investigate the state of mind of the plaintiff to determine is bona fides, or does he... is there some objective standard implicit in the good faith, there have to be some objective basis for the good faith belief?"
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1716.086,1720.689,"Well, I'm not sure if we can fine-tune the standard here to that degree."
2001.00-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1746.577,1751.761,"Your client says, you know, I can tell by looking at people whether they're lying or not, and I think the employer lied to me."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1753.499,1758.699,"--For a lawyer, I think that would be an insufficient basis on which to go forward."
2001.00-1853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1758.699,1776.235,"Mr. Minear, what is the status in today's trial where... it's a long time ago, but we used to make... see a lot of complaints where facts were alleged on information and belief, and therefore they would set them out very particularly but not necessarily conclusively, but I don't see any information and belief allegations in this complaint."
2001.00-1853,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1778.71,1780.15,"It continues to be used, Your Honor."
2001.00-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.843,1782.369,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1784.87,1800.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question of whether a plaintiff must allege an inference of discrimination in order to stay the claim under title VII in the Age Discrimination and Employment Act."
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.633,1833.819,"May I ask you right at the outset, because I want to get to... if the complaint itself, without illumination from the memorandum that you put in, was sufficient, would he lose because you create a different atmosphere from looking at the memorandum?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1833.819,1835.462,"--Your Honor, no."
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.774,1839.249,So we can look at the case without looking at the memorandum?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1839.249,1849.702,"--You can look at the case without looking at the memorandum, because the complaint alleges that the memorandum outlined the petitioner's grievances with the company and requested a severance package."
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.163,1864.833,"31 is not enough by itself, but there are other allegations in there to at least raise an inference, I think."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1864.833,1868.171,--There are no other allegations in this complaint that raise an inference.
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.566,1885.126,"No, paragraph 37 alleges plaintiff's age and national origin were motivating factors in Sorema's decision to terminate his employment."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1886.321,1888.593,"--Justice Stevens, that's conclusion."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.694,1911.409,"Well, why isn't that fair notice, Ms. Brody?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1916.945,1923.318,"--Yes, he does, Your Honor, but that's... Mr. Chief Justice, but that's a conclusion, and that is not sufficient under Federal rules."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.318,1925.297,What do you mean by saying it's a conclusion?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1925.297,1936.358,"It's a conclusion that does not set forth what Rule 8 requires, and Rule 8 says that you have to indicate what the grounds on which the claim is based--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.358,1943.862,"Ms. Brody, why is it any more or less of a conclusion, any different from negligently drove?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,1971.051,1980.913,"--Your Honor, if you look at that complaint, that Form 9 complaint, which alleges negligence, it sets forth all the elements of the claim."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1990.63,1997.27,"I don't see that... what you added maybe so, but the form doesn't say that."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2001.35,2008.443,--Those are reasonably inferences that can be drawn from a very simple negligence action.
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.443,2012.641,"Well, surely the same inferences could be drawn here, couldn't they?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2020.961,2032.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that's the case, because in the negligence action when an individual drives a car into another individual, it can be inferred that negligence was involved in that."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.779,2035.121,You don't have to infer it.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2035.633,2043.574,"It does say it, Your Honor, but in an employment situation, when an individual is terminated, individuals are terminated every day."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.574,2048.817,"Yes, but here he alleged that he was terminated because of his nationality and because of his age."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2048.817,2056.362,There is nothing that connects his nationality and his age with the termination of his employment.
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.362,2059.525,"Well, he... but he says that he was terminated for that reason."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2067.878,2071.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are not asking that a plaintiff plead evidence."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.665,2129.611,"I thought there was a statement here that other people who had been... were not let go, people for whom there was cause."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2131.835,2142.55,"--Justice Ginsburg, there is nothing in connection with the termination of employment that indicates that the petitioner was treated differently from other employees."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.806,2186.155,But he can still use them to show that is the mind set of the employer.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2196.513,2199.75,"--Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully disagree."
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.574,2215.371,"Sorry, then I'm confused, because I... you don't... an inference isn't the kind of thing that you allege."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2227.259,2229.963,"That... facts, factual allegations."
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.963,2237.291,"That would... you have... he has to allege certain facts that would give rise to an inference, all right."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2237.291,2237.745,That is correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.745,2274.635,"What he did allege was, he alleged as a matter of fact over 2 years people who he alleges were factually less qualified and were either younger or not Hungarian obtained all kinds of advantages that he did not, and then he was fired because of his grievances, and a fair reading is that is both a factual allegation, and grievance refers to what he called... said earlier in the complaint, so why don't those facts give rise to an inference that his... what he said was the conclusion?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2274.635,2284.923,"Those allegations import into this case a concept which has never been asserted, and that is this continuing violation theory."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2313.638,2316.315,Which case are you mentioning now?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2316.315,2318.491,Rix v. Delaware State College.
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.491,2321.099,Was that a 12(b)(6) case?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2321.099,2323.025,"That was a 12(b)(6) case, Your Honor."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2323.025,2325.286,And the complaint was held insufficient?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2325.286,2328.438,"The complaint was held insufficient, and this Court refused--"
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.438,2347.286,"Well, it was held to be time-barred because the relevant time was when he lost his seniority, rather than when he was terminated, and here you're arguing that the only evidence of discrimination is that during the 2 or 3 years before they treated the French employees better than the Hungarian employees, and it's unreasonable to infer from that that the discharge was similarly motivated."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2347.286,2348.091,--That is correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.091,2349.846,"And they say it was, and so there's an issue of fact."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2349.846,2352.134,But it's not a matte of unreasonableness.
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.563,2373.707,"But if even one of them was a good claim, it shouldn't have been dismissed."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2378.129,2381.489,The demotion claim cannot be considered because it's time-barred.
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.486,2419.105,"Well, why not?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2422.833,2452.662,"--Your Honor, in certain situations such as a harassment case where there is... are continuing acts of discrimination that occur, that might be appropriate, but in a case like this, where separate and discrete acts are being alleged, and the first act was completed in 1995... nothing more happened after that... there is no reasonable basis for linking these two acts together and basing the termination on the demotion allegations."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.987,2473.686,"Well, does he nowhere allege that his firing was because he was Hungarian, or because he was... because of his age?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2473.686,2494.822,"--He makes the conclusory allegations that I was terminated because of my national origin and age, but that does not... that alone is not sufficient to sustain the claim, a claim, and that is what this Court has stated in Conley, in which it emphasized that the plaintiff had to set forth the grounds on which the claim rests."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.531,2513.494,What was lacking in Conley?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2516.726,2518.817,There was nothing lacking in the complaint in Conley.
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.979,2583.995,But unfortunately you don't have any in which we find a complaint insufficient because it does not contain that detail.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2606.705,2607.366,I--
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.366,2608.155,That's hard to find.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2608.155,2625.057,"--I think the case that we have, the best case that we have to refer to is the Sutton case, where the Court looked at each of the allegations of the complaint, determined whether or not the plaintiff was disabled, and refused to accept the conclusory allegation that the plaintiff made that she was disabled."
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.057,2627.755,It wasn't because the allegations weren't sufficiently detailed.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2636.342,2637.766,That's correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.766,2653.771,"I mean, that would be like saying in this case, well, even if he were... his age and national origin were motivating factors in the decision, that doesn't violate the statute, you have to do something more, and I suppose maybe you could argue that, that motivation isn't enough, it's got to be the sole cause, or something like that."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2653.771,2655.115,Your Honor--
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.115,2660.598,There was plenty... it isn't... the Sutton case was not an absence of detail in the complaint.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2660.598,2666.043,"--And Your Honor, this is not a case about the absence of detail or specificity."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.427,2678.305,That sounds like evidence again.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2709.462,2718.726,"--Your Honor, if you look at the Dioguardi complaint you will see that all of the elements of the claim are alleged in that complaint."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.726,2720.678,What do you mean by elements?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2729.243,2740.683,"That is correct, Your Honor, but there has to be something in the complaint that goes to the heart of the claim and, in a discrimination case, the heart of the claim is the discrimination."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.737,2759.803,"Well, wait--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.803,2765.446,--And what he did was not equivalent to defendant owes plaintiff X dollars for goods sold and delivered on a certain date.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2765.446,2766.705,"No, Your Honor."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.907,2787.366,There's a lot more than that in this complaint.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2789.809,2814.331,"--It goes on for several pages, but the facts do not support the conclusion, that is, the factual allegations, and there are factual allegations in this complaint, and interestingly, petitioner doesn't claim that he doesn't have to allege that he was a member of a protected class, he doesn't claim that he doesn't have to allege that he was qualified, and he doesn't claim that he did not have to allege that there was an adverse employment action."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.435,2830.214,"Those elements are not necessary for... to win, are they?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2879.873,2888.15,"--Your Honor, you would have to look at the four corners of the complaint and determine whether there were any other allegations in it."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.15,2900.491,"No, but you're arguing this case as though it is an essential... it is essential to win a title VII claim that you establish a prima facie case, and I don't think it is."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2900.491,2910.966,"Your Honor, I believe under McDonnell Douglas if you're going to base your claim on an inferential case that you do need to allege and prove the elements of the prima facie case."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.966,2915.526,Unless you have other manners of establishing liability.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2915.526,2917.27,That is correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.27,2925.681,And those are questions of fact which need not be pleaded.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2928.561,2945.558,"Your Honor, the word evidence has been used frequently, and neither the court of appeals, the district court, or the respondent here is suggesting that a petitioner or plaintiff must allege facts or set forth evidence."
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.707,2963.745,I've never seen an allegation of an inference.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2975.745,2980.113,--The case is that he has to make factual allegations.
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.113,2980.753,Okay.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2982.945,2983.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.691,2985.585,And so... all right.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,2991.345,2991.985,Yes.
2001.00-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.699,3013.963,"Well, in addition to what he said, he also said that everybody else, and he names about 10 people, who were dismissed were dismissed for cause and given severance benefits, but he was dismissed without cause and wasn't given severance benefits."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3041.094,3052.241,"Because those allegations alone are insufficient in that he does not allege the national origin of any of those individuals, some of whom could be Hungarian."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.697,3074.817,But is that really essential to pleading a claim for relief here?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3095.825,3107.419,"What he ought to have alleged is the kind of allegation that is alleged in McDonnell Douglas, that is alleged in McDonald v. Santa Fe, that is alleged in Rix."
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.707,3117.206,But McDonnell Douglas I don't think was ever meant to be a pleading requirement.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3123.921,3131.606,"--McDonnell Douglas can be used as a pleading requirement, and it is sensible for it to be so used--"
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3131.606,3131.867,Well--
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3131.867,3133.809,--because at the pleading stage--
2001.00-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.809,3144.118,"--I think many of us would agree with you that it would be sensible for it to be so used, but the rules just don't provide for it."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3144.118,3147.478,--McDonnell Douglas reflects title VII.
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.001,3167.606,"There's a huge difference between pleading a case and proving a case, and pleading a case does not require you to put forward your evidence."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3191.462,3201.841,"--Your Honor, the idea that a complaint need only allege a conclusion in order to proceed with discovery and summary judgment and trial--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.841,3208.326,"This count, Rule 11... this person was represented before the district court, right?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3208.326,3209.755,--Correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3209.755,3225.233,"In fact, the same counsel, and there was a representation to the court made by the attorney under Rule 11 that says there's a good basis in law and fact for this charge."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3226.913,3238.566,"That does count for something, but the problem which we're addressing here is that there are not sufficient allegations in this complaint which indicate that discrimination has anything to do with--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3238.566,3246.678,"And the best case you have for that is the statute of limitations case, which is an affirmative defense that, if the time is up, that's it."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3276.166,3299.425,"--I think that if you look at McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail you will see that the Court there utilized McDonnell Douglas on a 12(b)(6) motion, and it examined the allegations in the complaint there to determine whether or not the plaintiff had alleged facts which could give rise to an inference of discrimination."
2001.00-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.558,3311.174,What case are you referring to now?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3311.174,3315.009,"That is the case, McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3315.009,3317.649,That was a dismissal under 12(b)(6)?
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3317.649,3319.691,That was a dismissal on a 12(b)(6).
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.339,3357.793,"You have to file a paper that's called the complaint, and a right-to-sue letter is not that."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3370.065,3378.465,"--Well, I don't believe that you have to have a document that's entitled, Complaint, in order to file it as a complaint with the court."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3395.745,3396.833,I'm confused.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3400.897,3406.305,"That's correct, and the plaintiff in that case took the right-to-sue letter, went to court, and filed it."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3406.305,3408.529,But that was not the plaintiff's pleading.
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3410.209,3415.783,"Well, the plaintiff called that his pleading, and he proceeded on that as his pleading."
2001.00-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.783,3420.844,"May I ask you just one question, as having studied the complaint as carefully as you have?"
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3428.519,3435.393,"Your Honor, that's an excellent question, and I think there has been a use of these terms very loosely."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3479.244,3486.913,"The case that you cited, Santa Fe, that was a case that the plaintiff... where the plaintiff prevailed against the 12(b)(6)."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3486.913,3488.945,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3488.945,3498.353,"Well, I thought you gave that to us as an example of where McDonnell Douglas had been applied at the pleading stage to dismiss the case on 12(b)(6) grounds."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3498.353,3501.756,"Oh, Your Honor, I may have misspoke on that, but the Court--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3501.756,3513.527,"So all of your cases, then, are cases in which the plaintiff surmounted the 12(b)(6) hurdle, and there's language in that... you... for this mythical case that hasn't yet occurred."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3513.527,3529.063,"--Your Honor, I think that Rix, I think that Evans, and I think that Sutton area 11 cases where the claims were dismissed, which assist us in this case and indicate the kind of notice that is required, because even though--"
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3529.063,3542.7,"If I allege that the defendant gave me a dirty look, I'm going to be tossed out on 12(b)(6), and I could describe all the grimaces and everything else, and it won't do me any good because the law doesn't recognize such a claim."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3542.7,3544.759,--That is correct.
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3545.447,3546.071,That's--
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3546.071,3549.063,"However, that's in effect what this plaintiff did."
2001.00-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3553.905,3571.271,"--I thought when you... there is evidence outside the four corners of the complaint, then you can bring it as a Rule 56 summary judgment motion, not a 12(b)(6) motion, so technically that, if you're supposed to look only to the complaint on a 12(b)(6) motion that should not have been considered."
2001.00-1853,2,34175,lauren_r_brody,,3571.271,3586.545,"Your Honor, I think that it is universally recognized that if a document is referred to and relied on in the complaint, it is regarded as being incorporated into the complaint, and it's proper for the Court to look at it on a 12(b)(6) motion."
