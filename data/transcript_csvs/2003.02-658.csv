2003.02-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.423,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-658, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. the Environmental Protection Agency."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,10.01,12.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,54.408,79.134,"Well, do you think that the statute allows EPA to at least say, Alaska, you didn't go through the proper analysis here, you didn't consider, as contemplated by the statute, some of the costs and concerns that would enable a State to say, fine, you go ahead with less than the ultimate equipment?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,85.244,93.417,"EPA can say, yes, Alaska, you did not consider the statutory factors, but that is not the contention that's being made in this case, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.417,95.852,"Well, isn't that an element here in fact?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,113.563,114.761,"Two points, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.771,128.174,"Well, that's a... that's a pretty fine line."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,159.382,160.375,--It is our--
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.375,166.812,"--that this... that this discretionary determination is given to the States, and when the States are reviewed, they should be reviewed in court."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,166.812,169.207,"--That is our... our position, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.207,174.326,"Well, why isn't it for... for the... for the hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives as well as for everything else?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,174.326,180.065,I think that the... the line is whether the requirements of the statute were followed or not.
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.797,189.558,"Well, assuming they weren't followed, is your position that when they are not followed, EPA can call them to account?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,189.558,201.408,"--EPA has the authority to enforce the requirements and prohibitions of the act, but we believe that authority should be narrowly circumscribed to the bounds that Congress set for the EPA."
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,201.408,205.245,"Well, let... let me intervene and... and suggest this."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,225.928,226.317,Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,226.317,227.598,--or am I misstating the theory here?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,227.598,228.425,"No, you're not, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.963,238.167,Okay.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,248.199,252.536,--if it's contention is it didn't comply with the express terms of the statute--
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.536,253.772,In... in this case... in this case--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,253.772,254.393,"--In this case, no."
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.393,257.365,"--as Justice O'Connor said, it didn't give... oh, it cannot go to Federal court?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,257.365,258.685,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,262.772,263.765,"Well, why couldn't it?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,268.139,268.427,--Exactly.
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,268.427,272.514,"Now, what they do is they say, we're now in Federal court."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,280.212,280.688,Correct.
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.688,284.031,"And so now they say, we're making the same claim identically."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,293.979,294.888,Exactly.
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.888,314.784,"You say that they should have gone into the Ninth Circuit under 1345 arguing it was arbitrary, capricious under State law, and they say that they should be in the Ninth Circuit arguing that it's arbitrary and capricious under Federal law, where I've never heard that there's any difference between arbitrary and capricious under State law or under Federal law."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,316.808,326.839,"There are two important differences, Your Honor, and... and I think they would have... 1345 is the statute I was just about to cite, and I think they would have the authority to go into Federal court under State law."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,375.963,378.48,"They do go into Federal court, and I do see your point."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,429.545,434.003,"--If Congress had made that clear in the statute, Your Honor, we would not be here."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.939,447.499,Mr. Franklin--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,447.499,448.259,--Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.259,458.728,"--perhaps I misunderstood your brief, but I thought that you were making the distinction in your brief between the substance of a decision and the procedural motions."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,480.482,484.447,"Yes, Your Honor, but that is not what we are here about today."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.387,500.627,"Well, why isn't it, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, when the EPA is saying, in essence, you didn't really go through the feasibility analysis because you didn't even ask for the relevant information?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,500.627,508.612,"--To get back to that, Your Honor, the... what EPA is saying is that we did go through the factors, but we didn't weigh them the way EPA would."
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.392,546.135,So you want--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,548.614,549.273,No.
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.273,555.673,It's not just a question of the agency coming into Federal court the way a private citizen would and challenging the State action.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,558.207,558.933,Exactly.
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.933,567.478,--which order is presumptively valid and which would have to be deferred to by the Federal court presumably unless the order was arbitrary or capricious.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,567.478,568.304,And that is what I was--
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.304,581.102,"So you'd be deciding in Federal court whether it was arbitrary or capricious for EPA to find the State to have been arbitrary or capricious, a very... a very refined determination, to put it mildly."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,581.102,582.3,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that is--"
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.3,583.536,But isn't that the problem?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,587.501,588.178,--Exactly.
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.539,597.077,But it is.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,623.167,626.883,"--Well, as Justice Breyer pointed out, it's an open question."
2003.02-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.898,652.617,"Well, but the action has to properly lie in order for it to be successful, and when you have... on what basis would the agency be suing?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,652.617,655.589,"They would be suing under the State review procedure, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.387,660.047,I don't think they could do it.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,682.976,692.164,"--Well, in... in our opinion in that situation, Your Honor, it would be subject to the APA-type review and it would be struck down."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,695.341,697.366,What's the role of the Federal court?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,697.366,712.059,"--Well, if EPA is the one bringing the action, I... I would accept Your Honor's premise that once it has proceeded through the comment process, once it has proceeded through the administrative review process... and frankly, we think that that particular matter would end there."
2003.02-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.916,748.634,"Well, I don't... I don't understand anyway because the statute that we're looking at, section 113(a)(5) says that if EPA finds a State is not acting in compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the PSD program--"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,748.634,749.46,--Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,749.46,753.381,--EPA can stop construction and issue orders.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,795.613,803.331,It would and... and that's precisely the reversal of the kind of presumption of regularity that the States are entitled to in these kinds of cases.
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.331,803.869,Mr. Franklin--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,823.764,825.167,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.167,825.539,All right.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,827.025,827.563,Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.563,843.333,"Now, if you want us to write the opinion your way, you would say under 17... 7413(a)(5), the State... the EPA cannot issue an order barring construction unless."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,844.986,852.416,Unless a State has... if there was a demonstrated violation of an express statutory requirement.
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,854.811,855.471,Well--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,855.471,860.839,--issued a permit to begin with or a State has not put a BACT limitation into a permit.
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.582,870.415,"--Unless there's a violation of an express statutory requirement, but the Government is going to come up and say, there was a... there was a violation of the statute defining BACT."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,870.415,875.412,"--But in this case, Your Honor, that is not with respect to... to the EPA, that's not what they're saying."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.415,902.244,"What your formulation is, is that they did not follow a requirement of the statute."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,924.869,934.174,"--It is certainly a requirement of law, Your Honor, but it is a background principle that derives ultimately, we think, from the Due Process Clause not a unstated requirement of the Clean Air Act."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.889,953.31,"I mean, that isn't going to get... the reason I think we're... I'm having the same trouble Justice Scalia is because the kind of... in my mind anyway, I tend to think of a classical definition of arbitrary and capricious as sometimes involving they didn't follow what the statute told them to do."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,973.994,976.966,"--Well, I think that judges would, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,992.077,992.57,Where is--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,998.393,998.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.886,1001.669,It doesn't seem to be limiting the authority of EPA.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1015.482,1022.086,The statute governs how the agency's... gives the agency the discretion.
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.634,1038.637,"Well, but this... that provision gives the... the EPA the authority to issue certain orders."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1038.637,1039.547,Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.547,1045.119,And is it your position that they did not have the authority to issue the order here or that the order was wrong?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1045.119,1053.499,"Our... that they did not have the authority because there was not a... a violation of the requirements of the act, which is the only basis--"
2003.02-658,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.499,1060.641,"Even if there were a violation of the requirements of the act, would you say they... if... if there were a violation of the act, would they have the authority to issue it... issue that order?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1060.641,1066.009,"--If there... if there were a violation of the express requirements of the act, then... then that's what the statute says."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.561,1084.418,That's in advance of the permit.
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1149.146,1149.434,--Right.
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1149.434,1171.082,"--generator by generator, where you're taking the position or Alaska is taking the position that if you can reduce overall emissions by putting the Low NOx on all six generators and in the end have cleaner air, well, then do that and forget about the SCR on one machine."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1182.954,1186.752,"Yes, it is, and we believe that EPA is... is wrong on that."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.44,1215.276,"But that's... it's either that you go at it machine... source by source, new source by new source, modification by modification, or you can have the bubble concept."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1236.47,1237.113,--Right.
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.113,1244.793,"And that seems to be a basic difference on what the statute means, not on... mix it all up and is it arbitrary and capricious."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1244.793,1249.334,"We think that it's... in fact, there is a difference on... on how it's to be implemented."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.031,1271.087,"But on the facts here I thought... now, tell me if I'm right about this."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1318.353,1326.731,"--You're almost right, Your Honor, but the... the difference is that there... there were four other generators that were subject to the cap, but there were six other generators total."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.731,1332.304,"I know, but then we... I had my law clerk go through and do the extra emissions from those other two, and it didn't really make any difference."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1332.304,1333.956,"It did... it does make a difference, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.956,1334.178,It does?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1334.178,1344.73,"Because of the assumption that Alaska made, and that is that if you used SCR on MG-17... and this has never been challenged... that... that MG-17 would be the backup generator."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1376.02,1376.559,If I go--
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1412.612,1417.342,"--You look at the new source, Your Honor, but you're allowed to consider environmental impact in looking at it."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.009,1437.2,What... what other method is there besides the top-down?
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1448.467,1450.242,"It could... it could be bottom-up, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.099,1467.703,"Is that in fact the situation, that there are other ways, or is it just in theory, but they all use top-down?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1467.703,1482.192,"--Your Honor, I don't know what every State uses, but I do know that Congress made clear... and the legislative history at page 31 of the Senate report is crystal clear on this point... that each State was to have the discretion to weigh the factors in its own judgment."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.962,1507.538,"Mr.... Mr. Franklin, the... the difficulty that I'm having with... with your argument about the meaning of the statute goes back to your answer I think to Justice Kennedy's question awhile ago."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1541.514,1542.628,--Yes.
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1542.628,1549.809,"And that leads me back to... as I said, I guess, to Justice Kennedy's question, and that is this."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1574.866,1575.981,"They don't trivialize it, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.64,1589.727,"And... and EPA could do the same thing by following the State review process, couldn't it?"
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1589.727,1590.266,--It--
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1590.266,1593.914,"It could go in and say, look, they forgot X. They refused to apply Y."
2003.02-658,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1593.914,1607.272,"--But if its contention is one that the statute gives the discretion but it was simply not exercised in the proper way that we would have exercised it, that is not a contention that Congress wanted EPA to be able to resolve by fiat."
2003.02-658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.272,1608.303,"Well, but I mean, that's... that's the question."

2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1693.093,1697.839,"Well, I don't think he is... I mean, my impression of their argument was, yes, you can review that."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1708.902,1709.933,"Yes, but--"
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.933,1712.534,"I think that's what their argument was, or at least one of their arguments."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1712.534,1716.515,"--But, Your Honor, Congress enacted a Federal regulatory scheme and a Federal enforcement scheme."
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.515,1716.904,That's a different thing.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1721.162,1734.082,"Review only under State law, Your Honor, and... and our point is that Congress has enacted a comprehensive Federal regulatory scheme and authorized EPA to serve as a backstop to ensure compliance with all of the requirements of the act, or this... this portion of the act."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.082,1737.304,"--That's begging... I mean, that... that is exactly the point at issue, it seems to me."

2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.403,1812.639,"Well, let's see what it says."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1812.639,1814.125,"--It imposes meaningful constraints, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.402,1823.663,But you're... you're missing the... the first part of it.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1850.617,1851.071,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.245,1869.276,But they're... they're not saying--
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1869.276,1870.307,--these constraints on the decision maker.
2003.02-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.307,1872.453,--They're not saying that the discretion is unreviewable.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1876.13,1881.331,"They're saying that it's not reviewable as a matter of Federal law, Your Honor, and that is what we're talking about here."
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.331,1895.282,"Well, Federal... are you aware of any State in the United States that does not have in its law the requirement that its own agencies have to act rationally, that they can't arbitrarily, abuse of discretion?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1895.282,1897.345,"I don't know, Your Honor, but--"
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.345,1898.625,"Well, I don't know of any either."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1898.625,1899.452,--But I know there--
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.452,1911.091,"And so that seems to be the same standard that you argue that applies, and since there is no State that doesn't have that standard and no Federal Government that doesn't have it, we all have the same standard."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1922.858,1930.576,"--Well, number one, I believe various States have standing requirements that may be more restrictive than those applicable under... under Federal law."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.12,1963.725,It's a range of judgment.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1970.329,1971.999,"--With respect, Your Honor, that's not correct."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.564,2000.959,Tell me again where... where--
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2000.959,2005.334,7475(a)(3) on... on 13a of the gray brief appendix.
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.334,2006.077,--On 13a.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2006.077,2006.449,Yes.
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.449,2007.275,(4).
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2008.102,2009.421,(4) is the BACT requirement.
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.282,2025.025,(j).
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2025.025,2025.479,--(j).
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.138,2079.737,"Well, could... could we get specific in this case?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2103.581,2111.179,"--Alaska made a determination, but it did not determine best available control technology within the constraints of the statute, and the... and the easiest--"
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.179,2111.922,"Well, how so?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2118.07,2149.567,"--Well, they... they didn't determine the maximum degree that is achievable, taking into account these factors, because the only basis for their rejection of the best technology selective control... I mean, selective catalytic reduction was their reliance on economic impacts, and specifically what they said was the foremost consideration... the foremost consideration... for their rejection of SCR, according to the State... this is at page 208 of the joint appendix... was impact of the cost of SCR on the competitiveness of the mine."
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.682,2151.053,What's wrong... what's wrong with that?
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2151.303,2162.903,"--What's wrong with that, Your Honor, is that on the previous page, on page 207 of the joint appendix, the State admits that because Cominco refused to provide the financial information, they had no basis for making a judgment."
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2164.927,2166.247,"--Well, let me just ask you--"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2166.247,2166.618,They couldn't make a judgment about that very issue.
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2166.618,2167.24,--a technical point.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2204.392,2207.53,"On... on an appropriate record, absolutely they could do that."
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.728,2211.079,So this wouldn't be the end of the day.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2211.079,2211.7,--That's correct.
2003.02-658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.242,2217.023,"Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar--"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2230.731,2233.619,"--In State court, no, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2233.619,2233.907,All right.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2240.595,2241.998,I don't believe so.
2003.02-658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.424,2256.198,So the EPA has been consistent in saying that it... it is not in any case like this or with parallels to this gone through an administrative process.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2257.602,2258.799,--That's correct.
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.545,2282.743,That doesn't surprise me.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2359.731,2370.255,"--Taking the last part of your question first, Your Honor, there's nothing particularly strange about an appellate court reviewing a prior determination of whether an agency decision was arbitrary and capricious."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.369,2372.112,Square.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2372.112,2373.681,--under the APA when a district court... no.
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.681,2401.174,All right.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2493.0,2498.223,"Your Honor, the State agency did not justify its final permit decision on that rationale."
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.635,2501.938,That's a... that's one point.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2515.746,2516.86,"--But it's more than that, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.324,2538.557,Yes.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2539.811,2540.365,--Yes.
2003.02-658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.365,2545.095,And... and it is a question of interpretation of the text of this statute.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2560.783,2571.928,"Your Honor, and... and Chevron itself actually discusses this, as you... as you suggested, but Chevron recognizes that EPA has... has construed the... has applied the bubble concept or not differently."
2003.02-658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2598.511,2598.965,That's what I thought.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2614.653,2630.34,"--As a matter of law, what EPA has determined in... in exercising in... its rulemaking authority is that the statute requires that once it's determined that the BACT analysis must be made, it must be made on an individual unit basis, which is exactly what the State ultimately did here."
2003.02-658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.86,2652.464,"Mr. Hungar, can I ask you, going back to Justice Scalia's question earlier, is there a significant difference in the record before us in this proceeding than what the record would contain if they had followed the route of applying a review of the Alaska order through the State system?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2652.464,2653.95,"We don't believe so, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.919,2665.096,"Because my impression, the record really was the same no matter which way you went."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2665.096,2674.301,"--The Ninth Circuit, when this case was in... in the court of appeals, issued an order directing the preparation of a record and asking the parties what... to... to address whether the record was complete or not."
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2679.147,2681.005,"Well, did they... did they put in the whole State record--"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2681.005,2682.945,--I don't know that the whole--
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2682.945,2683.771,--before the State agency?
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2683.771,2685.879,--The... the administrative fills a box.
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2693.802,2699.746,But in any... I take your answer is they can put in the entire State record to go before the court of appeals.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2699.962,2700.201,Absolutely.
2003.02-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2718.944,2722.964,It goes back to a question that has now dropped out of the case entirely it seems.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2747.112,2792.959,"Upon further consideration of this Court's more recent precedents in the... in the area of finality, the... the Whitman case and Bennett against Spear and given the particular circumstances of this case where the agency... where EPA was not simply issuing an order to someone saying you're violating preexisting requirements of the act, but was in fact changing the status quo and stating that a... a permit that had been issued by the State that allowed construction could not take effect, in those circumstances we... we concluded that this Court's precedents regarding final orders are satisfied and that this is indeed a final order because it imposes legal obligations, new legal obligations, on Cominco."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.959,2803.483,"Mr. Hungar, you... you've just told us that the reviewing court can have the full State record before it when it makes its determination."
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2814.136,2820.285,"Well, it has to have evidence sufficient to make a finding that the State is not complying with the requirements of the act, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.285,2826.45,"Well, but it doesn't... it doesn't have to do that on the basis of the record presented to the agency, does it?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2826.45,2827.936,"Well, it's difficult--"
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.936,2828.474,Did it in this case?
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2831.696,2843.335,"--Well, in this case it's... although they had extensive record materials before them, the... the flaw in the State's decision making is apparent on the face of the State's own decision."
2003.02-658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.8,2866.536,Can you tell me?
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2912.066,2914.212,"I think it is wrong, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2974.276,2986.165,"So, do I... I understand you to say that they would be forced... I take it you're... implicitly you're saying they'd be forced to use this generator because the use of this generator would be the only way that they, in fact, could comply with the cap?"
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2986.165,2988.327,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3000.282,3000.775,For--
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3000.775,3002.344,For all seven generators.
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.344,3003.004,--for this... all seven.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3003.376,3008.0,And if... and that includes MG-17 under... using the Low NOx.
2003.02-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3024.802,3026.121,The cap... the cap wouldn't be lower.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3028.062,3029.753,The... the total emissions cap would be lower.
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3045.895,3049.982,--So... so the answer is it would probably... most probably use the new generator.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3049.982,3050.437,--Absolutely.
2003.02-658,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3050.437,3051.802,Theoretically it wouldn't have to.
2003.02-658,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3051.802,3052.378,Correct.

2003.02-658,2,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3106.991,3128.539,"--And... and that is precisely the problem in our view because EPA, if the Court upholds its authority in this case, can act by fiat at any time it wants on the basis of any information that it deems relevant, even after a permit has gone through the entire State process, even after it has become final under State law, and even after the source may have invested millions of dollars in the technology."
2003.02-658,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3133.99,3140.594,"Well, there are courts... there are courts with doctrines that would not allow such inequitable conduct."
