1984.83-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,We will hear arguments first this morning in School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,13.991,23.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States of Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit."
1984.83-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,117.891,121.279,Are these programs available to all the public schools on the same basis?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,121.279,125.564,"They are available to the children in the public schools as well, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.158,277.747,"Mr. Ripple, do you take the position that the standing requirements are satisfied in this case?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,277.747,281.766,--We do maintain that the standing requirement is not satisfied.
1984.83-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.522,327.997,"Was there a challenge to the state statutes providing money, or was it a challenge to the Grand Rapids administrative program?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,327.997,334.484,"It was a challenge to the Grand Rapids administrative program, and not to the legislative appropriation of the money."
1984.83-990,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.98,362.902,"But these people are Michigan taxpayers as well as Kent County or Grand Rapids taxpayers, aren't they?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,362.902,376.476,"They are, Your Honor, but they did not attack a specific use of the spending or taxing power by the legislature of Michigan."
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.446,616.516,"Mr. Ripple, you emphasized in your original three points, and just now, the remedial character of the program."
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,620.635,621.718,"Yes, Your Honor, we believe it would."
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.718,622.337,"And, if so, why?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,622.337,628.841,"We think that the touchstone here ought to be non-core, non-substitutionary."
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.369,646.902,But why not?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,656.975,661.177,"Well, that is not this case, but we believe--"
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.177,665.562,"I know it's not, but you emphasized the difference, and I'm trying to understand why do you emphasize that difference?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,665.562,685.208,"--We think that is a principle distinction to make and it is a good rule of thumb in applying the Lemon test, quite frankly, because it prevents the public school authorities from propping up the primary educational mission of the non-public schools."
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.208,688.51,"In other words, remedial training is not part of the primary education?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,688.51,689.01,That's correct.
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.21,713.978,It also has an interest in having good math teachers teach all the students.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,713.978,721.731,"It does, and it requires that a license be obtained by a non-public school before... so that it can engage in those programs."
1984.83-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.773,750.168,"In that regard, Mr. Ripple, do you think there is a greater entanglement problem for the community education program than for shared time because so many of the teachers in the community education program are the private school teachers who are being utilized?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,750.168,753.187,"It is a different situation, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.187,757.239,Do you think it's a greater entanglement problem as a result?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,757.239,761.392,We submit that the difference justifies the difference in treatment.
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.354,815.277,"Mr. Ripple, on the enrichment program, what percentage of the regular school day is taken up by--"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,815.277,818.645,"It varies from student to student, class to class, but--"
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.645,819.664,"--What's the average, 10 percent?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,819.664,821.064,--No more than 10 percent.
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.449,830.287,What would the students be doing during the regular school hours if they weren't in these enrichment classes?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,832.322,835.424,They would be in other classes during the day.
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.424,837.226,Then isn't this a substitution?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,837.226,845.696,"It is... they are, as I understand it, taken out, not from the course, but from certain hours of the course."
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.696,852.302,"Well, nevertheless, they're filling the time that the private school would otherwise fill itself."
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,852.302,852.935,They are doing that.
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.935,855.254,With its own professors.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,855.254,867.162,"Yes, but they still must take all of the courses in the school, so they are in effect being excused from class to take the remedial or enrichment class, but still must--"
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.162,870.514,"But still, they can't be in two places at once."
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,870.514,871.247,--No.
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.247,881.302,So they are in one of these classrooms when otherwise they would be in the private school's classroom.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,881.302,884.939,"But they can have two responsibilities at once, and they do."
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.158,892.277,"Well, I just wonder."
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,900.549,904.518,"I submit it is not crucial to our case, simply because they maintain both responsibilities."
1984.83-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.518,905.52,"Yeah, all right."
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,916.542,926.183,"They are the same... the student... normally, the hours required are somewhat less than children actually are in school, I believe, in most states, sir."
1984.83-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.652,932.504,Do they count toward the fulfillment of the hours?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,932.504,935.289,The students are required to be in the school building at that time; yes.
1984.83-990,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,940.258,949.716,"May I ask, Mr. Ripple, does the State require certification of private schools?"
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,949.716,953.334,"Yes, it does require that they be licensed."
1984.83-990,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,955.151,964.206,Do they have to be accredited in terms of approving them as suitable to educate children for higher education?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,964.206,975.931,"--The Michigan statute says they must give comparable education, and that has been... to the public schools... and that has been interpreted as meaning they must give classes in language, art, social studies, science, and mathematics."
1984.83-990,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,975.931,979.401,Do the teachers have to be certified by the state board of education?
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,979.401,983.52,I believe they must have a state license.
1984.83-990,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,983.52,986.905,And that requires a certain level of training to teach.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,986.905,988.091,It does.
1984.83-990,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,993.309,996.861,I'm asking about teachers in general at private schools.
1984.83-990,0,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,996.861,999.512,I believe they must have a license as well.
1984.83-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1026.38,1033.518,Mr. McConnell.
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1033.518,1047.86,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Grand Rapids is not alone in its decision to provide supplemental educational services to school children in the schools that they regularly attend, whether those schools are public or non-public."
1984.83-990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1059.168,1069.124,"Mr. McConnell, do you see any significant differences at all in the Grand Rapids shared time program and the Title I program?"
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1069.124,1072.576,"Your Honor, I see some relatively minor differences."
1984.83-990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1078.662,1086.316,Does the payment of lease money to the school constitute a significant difference in your view?
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1086.316,1087.835,That is a difference.
1984.83-990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1116.169,1129.243,Is the supervision of teachers in the Title I program significantly greater than in the Grand Rapids program by the public school administrators?
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1129.243,1138.848,"Your Honor, you should understand that the precise arrangements for the Title I administration vary from school district to school district."
1984.83-990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.64,1187.179,Do you see a difference in the community education program and the shared time program in Grand Rapids for purposes of your comparison?
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1187.179,1188.781,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1984.83-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.541,1414.827,I didn't question that distinction.
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1414.827,1416.179,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1440.211,1451.602,"On that point, Mr. McConnell, would it be a different case if one of the non-public schools said we'd like to provide these remedial programs; we just don't have enough money to do it... because I would think most schools would like to provide it."
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1452.968,1469.914,"Your Honor, I do not believe it would, because if the principle were that any services that a private school might conceivably and desirably, given infinite resources, provide to the students could be provided, and that that were a constitutionally valid way of looking at the program--"
1984.83-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.914,1470.747,And in order to match the--
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1470.747,1480.253,"--That would mean the transportation, textbooks, any forms of assistance that have been approved by this Court as being benefits to the children, would become suspect."
1984.83-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.809,1495.261,"--You are suggesting they would not bear this burden, even if they could afford to do it?"
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1497.713,1506.985,"--If they had infinite resources, I suspect that they would provide not only this, but also transportation and textbooks and numerous other benefits as well."
1984.83-990,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1615.482,1625.922,Is there anything in the record that shows how many times state supervisors investigate private schools in Michigan?
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1625.922,1640.014,"Your Honor, there is evidence in the record that the public school officials do attend, on a regular and non-announced basis, the classes conducted by the public schools."
1984.83-990,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.014,1642.199,Once every 26 years would be regular.
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1644.985,1651.989,"I believe, Your Honor, that the practice is, on a general basis, once per month."
1984.83-990,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.989,1653.091,That's in the record?
1984.83-990,1,35623,michael_w_mc_connell,,1653.091,1654.341,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.947,1667.499,"Your time has expired now, Mr. McConnell."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1670.601,1682.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address myself, if I may, to the specifics of the actual operation of the Grand Rapids program and touch three points."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.69,1711.778,Is that aid different in principle from textbooks that are being supplied at public expense?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1711.778,1718.033,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it is different in principle and in fact, especially as we looked at this particular case."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.033,1720.149,"At some point, it's your own time."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1720.149,1723.335,"I would like to develop that point, sir, if I may."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.735,1801.268,Is that true--
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1801.268,1801.985,--Sir?
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.985,1807.656,--Do you say that apply to remedial reading or dyslexics?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1807.656,1822.248,"It's the proclamation of each of these schools that in their teaching of a given subject, in each classroom, each subject, each course, that school is dedicated to infusing secular education with a religious point of view."
1984.83-990,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.335,1939.743,"Do you feel, Mr. Howard, that that factor distinguishes the parochial and sectarian schools involved here from other sectarian schools that have involved in our earlier cases?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1939.743,1965.793,"What we have in this case is perhaps the fullest record that this Court has had in a paroch-aid case since the cases first started coming to the Court in the early '70s or early '60, and the remarkable thing about this record is that given the completeness of the documentation, I know of no case in which one has to resort so little to surmise about the pervasive sectarianism of the schools, that they look instead to the--"
1984.83-990,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.793,1973.214,"Well, do you think the Court in its earlier decisions assured that the sectarian schools really weren't sectarian?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,1973.214,1978.784,"--Well, it seems to me that in the earlier cases, there were often profiles which were indulged in."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.964,2059.236,"Is there any evidence, Mr. Howard, that in teaching the remedial reading, for example, they used religious materials, the bible or other religious materials?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2059.236,2069.86,"Mr. Chief Justice, in the shared time programs, there is no evidence in the record that religious materials were used in those classrooms or in fact that religious doctrines were taught."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.86,2071.479,"The evidence is just to the contrary, isn't it?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2071.479,2073.095,"It's a lack of evidence, Justice White."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.608,2120.393,"Wasn't there any evidence, any testimony about this at all?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2120.393,2122.662,"--There was evidence, testimony--"
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.662,2123.412,What about the teachers?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2123.412,2126.297,--Some of the teachers testified that they did not.
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.297,2131.018,The only evidence there is is that they did not.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2131.018,2132.118,It seems to me--
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.118,2133.118,Isn't that right?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2133.118,2135.303,"--If I may say so, it's self-serving evidence."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.303,2137.588,"Well, nevertheless, I'm right."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2140.224,2145.278,You are right that the only evidence is that the teachers in question did not teach religion.
1984.83-990,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.278,2147.978,Most evidence in trials is self-serving.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2155.899,2163.689,"Justice Rehnquist, my remedy would be to have a mix of public and private students in the same classroom where you then have an automatic kind of safeguard."
1984.83-990,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.689,2167.291,"Well, when you're designing school programs, maybe you can do that."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2167.291,2171.493,"Well, let me develop that idea, if I may."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.415,2441.534,How about remedial reading and make-up math?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2441.534,2442.967,They would have taught remedial reading.
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2452.29,2454.425,But no special classes such as these.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2454.425,2456.377,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-990,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2469.617,2480.325,"Mr. Howard, in this regard, is the Grand Rapids case different from the Title I case that we were about to hear later this morning?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2480.325,2495.835,"Well, Justice O'Connor, it seems to me that the Grand Rapids case has yet more indicia of a public school system taking over the functions of a private school, because in the Title I case, all of the programs there are remedial."
1984.83-990,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.775,2662.077,"Is that different from Title I programs, Mr. Howard?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2662.077,2676.502,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think there is some of the same opportunity in Title I for a non-public school to opt out of the program if they see fit, and I can't, on the face of it, see a dispositive difference there."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.502,2682.89,"Well, Mr. Howard, the classroom teacher can't force the student into the--"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2682.89,2685.025,"Justice White, that's quite correct."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.025,2687.71,--So there is a choice by the student and the parent.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2687.71,2688.744,"Well, not really."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.744,2692.614,"Well, they have the choice to turn it down; right?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2692.614,2695.983,"If the... turn it down by whom, the school or the--"
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.983,2696.4,No.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2700.602,2702.304,"--No, I'm sorry, sir; I didn't say that."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.037,2708.307,You mean that the school... the classroom teacher can assign and require the--
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2708.307,2716.479,"--The regular classroom teacher, the private school teacher decides which of his or her students need remedial work--"
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.479,2716.896,--Exactly.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2716.896,2723.383,"--or would profit from enrichment work, and sends those children to the public employee who is teaching shared time courses."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.383,2731.673,"So, again, could the student or the parents of the student say sorry, but we do not want the child to participate in that program?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2731.673,2735.025,"That would be a negotiating process, no doubt, between parents and school."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.025,2737.393,"Well, there isn't there an answer, yes or no, to that?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2737.393,2739.06,"The answer is yes, but."
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.06,2740.429,"Yes, but what?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2740.429,2749.134,"And the yes, but... the ""but"" part is that if the regular classroom teacher thinks that the student would not benefit and therefore doesn't send that child for it--"
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.134,2750.8,Then he can't go in.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2750.8,2752.402,--That's right.
1984.83-990,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.402,2758.24,"But if he says here's one that should go in, the student can say, and his parents can say, sorry, we don't want him to."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2758.24,2759.49,The parent could say no to that.
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2760.173,2761.292,That's all I really wanted to know.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2770.281,2771.748,"Yes, sir; they were."
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2771.748,2776.535,Does Michigan approve textbooks and classroom materials?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2776.535,2782.006,"Michigan has, as I understand the State system, a very decentralized sort of educational system."
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.808,2786.774,That's true in Virginia.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2786.774,2789.475,"True in Virginia, true in Texas, true in some others."
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2801.067,2810.006,"There's some flexibility in Virginia for local school boards to make choice of additional text material, but it has to be approved by the State."
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2810.006,2816.243,"As I understand Michigan, it's striking in the degree of autonomy it gives to its local school districts."
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2819.079,2824.766,But the material used in the shared time program is approved by their local school board?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2824.766,2827.535,And are therefore approved by the public authorities.
1984.83-990,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2828.402,2832.27,The same material used in both public and private schools.
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,2832.27,2833.504,That would be correct.
1984.83-990,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3075.678,3077.197,"What percentage, Mr. Howard?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,3077.197,3079.63,"--About 10 percent, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-990,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.755,3120.624,How would abdication tend to prove entanglement?
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,3120.624,3135.301,"It would mean that you're taking public money, public programs, putting those programs into the hands of religious authorities, letting them make decisions about allocation of resources, which seems to me a classic case of entanglement."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.368,3269.987,"But the facts are quite different, are they not?"
1984.83-990,2,16135,a_e_dick_howard,,3280.109,3292.85,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm simply drawing upon the principle that lies behind the Grendel case, which makes it clear that when you merge authority over decisions in the public arena, you've entangled Church and State."
1984.83-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.352,3400.971,Very well.
1984.83-990,3,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,3404.09,3407.192,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-990,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3559.587,3566.591,"Mr. Ripple, Professor Ripple, you feel the record here is different from that in the recently decided Missouri case."
1984.83-990,3,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,3566.591,3588.689,"We believe the record in this case does, in fact, substantiate that the relationships here were so structure so that this was a professional working relationship which, in fact, did not... which did not and could not overstep the bounds of impermissible entanglement, Mr. Justice."
1984.83-990,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3588.689,3593.693,Would the decision here govern and control the Missouri case if that ever comes--
1984.83-990,3,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,3593.693,3595.276,We do not believe that it ought to.
1984.83-990,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3598.145,3601.08,--So that the Missouri case might go the other way on its facts.
1984.83-990,3,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,3601.08,3609.62,"We do, sir, because we believe that what has happened here is the people of Michigan have established and structured a program which is good for them."
1984.83-990,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3609.62,3611.555,I want to be sure of your concession in that respect.
1984.83-990,3,33956,kenneth_f_ripple,,3611.555,3617.024,"And we believe that in that respect, they have a constitutional right to live with their good planning."
1984.83-990,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.374,3619.424,"Thank you, gentlemen."
