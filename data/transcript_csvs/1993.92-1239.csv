1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.754,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1239, J.E.B. v. T.B.--"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,10.104,13.889,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.174,152.296,"Well, do you think that men at large in this particular community really felt bad because male jurors had been stricken from this panel?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,152.296,159.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think at the time, obviously, the community as a whole was not cognizant of the problem."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.289,177.264,"Well, supposing that the local newspaper had run a story saying that these male jurors had been excluded, do you think the community at large or the community of men would have felt very badly about it?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,177.264,189.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that there would have been a perception that this was not fair, for a panel of all one gender, whether it be female or male, to try any particular case."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.177,203.997,"So the community would have felt differently than men would have felt about it, is that your answer?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,203.997,210.068,I think men... I would agree that men would have felt excluded in this particular case.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,215.389,227.28,"But men, as a class, historically have not been excluded from jury service, so why should an equal protection plea on behalf of men succeed?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,227.28,235.7,"Justice Ginsburg, men have not... I agree that men have not been excluded from jury service."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.097,263.536,"Well, why couldn't this be regarded as a kind of affirmative action for women to make up for all the years when Alabama totally excluded them from jury service?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,263.536,269.04,I'm not saying that that at some... for some reason could not be.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.151,292.222,"Mr. Porter, you speak of unwarranted stereotyping."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,292.222,292.689,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.689,307.815,"I take that to mean that there is nothing to the notion that you're... if you're a defendant in a rape case, you're likely to be worse off with an all-female jury and you're... if you're a defendant in a paternity case, you're not likely to be worse off with an all-female jury?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,313.135,328.912,"Justice Scalia, I would say that it is unwarranted because that while men and women are not the same, obviously, and do not have necessarily the same outlooks, but they do have the same ability to be unbiased, to become unbiased jurors in a particular case."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.912,340.953,"The same ability... they can both fight against it to the same degree, as every human being has to, but they begin from different standing points on certain issues such as those two, don't you think?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,352.028,365.168,"Justice Scalia, my response is that, and our position is that simply because... a woman is excluded from a jury because of her gender should be unwarranted and unreasonable."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.37,368.437,"Now, I don't understand."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,369.405,371.022,--Our position is that the--
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.022,384.065,"Are you saying that there's nothing to the fact that a woman juror and a man juror, at least in certain type of cases, may have a different outlook and hence be more likely to tend towards the defense or the prosecution side?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,386.934,389.001,"--Justice Scalia, I'm not saying there's nothing to that."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.219,395.271,"You're saying there is something to it, but counsel shouldn't be able to take that into account in their peremptories?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,395.271,397.056,--I think that you can consider that.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.53,415.851,"Mr. Porter, isn't it clear that there's something to most stereotypes, that most stereotypes are, indeed, accurate for a good part of the class?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,415.851,428.094,"--Justice Ginsburg, stereotypes are stereotypes, and they may, in fact, be applicable to a certain percentage of a particular group, such as 60 percent of the women may feal one way about a subject."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.901,441.768,But that's what peremptory challenges are all about.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,459.68,466.569,Peremptory challenges traditionally have been allowed and become a part of our judicial system because of counsel.
1993.92-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,489.066,500.04,"Isn't your argument that certain stereotyping, whatever its historical basis in fact may be, simply should not be recognized as tolerable under the Equal Protection Clause?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,504.492,507.278,"Yes, sir, Justice Souter, we do."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.568,521.953,Your argument is that you want a precedent that applies to race to be extended to sex.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,532.161,536.963,"Justice Ginsburg, in this particular case I think the Court need only go as far as gender."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.159,558.328,But does one inquire of each juror about the legitimacy of the juror's birth?
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,558.328,561.364,--Practically not.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.518,570.303,"Or, indeed, national origin?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,570.303,571.686,"--No, ma'am."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.607,579.159,"It is perhaps the difference that in race and sexes, you don't have to ask."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,579.159,579.642,--Correct.
1993.92-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,588.582,599.722,"Counsel, suppose an attorney were faced with a jury of all one gender, all male or all female, could the attorney then strike in order to increase diversity?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,599.722,608.678,"Justice Kennedy, in the race arena where counsel have in the past stricken for that cause, it has not been allowed."
1993.92-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.873,626.49,Mr. Porter--
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,632.944,643.316,The... I would agree that the... the objection would be to the individual challenge of the juror.
1993.92-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,643.316,661.213,"But your... isn't it your assumption, in answering Justice Kennedy's question, that there is no reason to infer that there was stereotyping or exclusion based on stereotyping in composing the panel from which his all-male jury or all-female jury was picked?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,662.363,662.846,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.098,668.134,"Which is, in fact, I presume, an unrealistic assumption."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,668.134,668.534,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.534,670.069,Or would be in those cases.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,670.069,671.319,"It would be, yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.306,680.607,"Mr. Porter, the male and female classes are roughly the same size, I guess."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,680.607,681.024,Yes.
1993.92-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.024,683.459,That's not always true in the racial or other contexts.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,692.749,705.909,"Justice Stevens, as to that panel, that... or as to the group of the jurors and the ability of counsel to obtain the correct mix, that may be the right answer, the way to resolve it."
1993.92-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.115,718.9,"Yeah, but what's the damage if one side thinks they don't like men and the other side thinks they don't like women?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,725.803,728.755,"--Justice Stevens, the entire group, I would agree, would not be--"
1993.92-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.755,732.492,Both men and women would be insulted because they're not of the opposite sex.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,732.492,732.842,--Right.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,738.13,747.319,"Although you have standing because of the client that you represent, which you're asserting, then, is the equal protection right of the juror, not the party."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,747.319,747.736,In part.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,758.125,760.227,"Well, isn't that the heart of your argument?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,760.227,760.727,It is.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.117,781.557,"Could I ask, Mr. Porter, what... is that the total list of categories that you want this applied to?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,788.829,791.265,National origin and--
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.265,792.715,National origin.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,792.715,793.281,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.281,795.65,Sexual preference?
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,795.65,798.769,"No, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.769,800.471,"Not... no, not that."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,801.42,810.242,"Because sexual preference, like age and disability, have not been raised by this Court to the heightened level of scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.242,810.826,Oh.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,812.344,814.63,"If the Court chose to at some point in time, then you could--"
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.63,814.896,Sure.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,815.263,816.03,--You certainly could.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.03,825.836,"But Mr. Porter, are you going to, in your system where we have these groups, allow the preliminary questioning of the potential jurors."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,835.125,835.543,Correct.
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.543,845.915,"But in the suggestions that you're now making, the notion that religion is not written on someone's forehead so we would first have to quiz the potential jurors about that."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,845.915,846.282,"Yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.282,847.517,Same thing with national origin.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,847.517,847.967,"Yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.967,851.403,Does that... does not... isn't that just a disturbing thought?
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,851.403,855.105,It is a somewhat invasion of their privacy.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.97,890.528,"So if you're the defendant in a drunken driving case, you can strike jurors for... I guess, because you don't like the color of their hair, but you could not strike a juror because he's a Methodist and therefore a teetotaler."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,899.217,899.884,"No, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.884,900.736,You would not.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,900.736,901.486,Not necessarily.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.99,908.373,"Well, that's why I'm striking him."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,908.373,909.675,--I understand.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.675,918.78,"I think this fellow probably has very strong views against drinking, and is more likely to come down hard on someone who's accused of drunken driving than some other juror."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,920.38,920.899,It is--
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.899,921.682,And you're saying that's no good.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,921.682,924.351,--It is the probably that gives me a problem with that.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.351,927.969,But all peremptories are based on probably.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,927.969,939.794,"Our position would be that if that Methodist professed to be a teetotaler, and so therefore had an individual conviction against the consumption of alcohol, that would be a proper peremptory strike."
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.794,944.163,But a teetotaler is just a person who doesn't himself drink alcohol.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,944.163,944.515,Correct.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.515,949.817,He doesn't necessarily believe that it's morally wrong for himself and others to do it.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,949.817,950.419,If--
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.419,954.204,"But, anyway, you just would not let him... not let him strike methodists, right?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,958.839,965.844,--If a postman had... there would be nothing wrong with striking postmen as a class.
1993.92-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.844,967.328,He'll be happy to hear that.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,967.328,968.011,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,969.213,977.819,"Mr. Porter, as a litigator, do you believe in the peremptory challenge system?"
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,977.819,986.592,"Justice Blackmun, I believe, as a litigator, that the peremptory challenge system certainly has a place within our jury selection process."
1993.92-1239,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,994.262,995.698,Do you think Batson was wrong?
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,995.698,996.498,"No, sir, I do not."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1001.851,1006.236,"Well, Mr. Porter, since Batson, which I guess was 7 years ago."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1006.236,1006.671,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.671,1018.813,"We've seen a number of cases here in which Batson issues have been raised because of the peremptories directed at minorities, of blacks or hispanics."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1044.194,1057.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, in any situation the first step the trial counsel is going to have to show is making out a prima facie case that the gender has been used intentionally to strike."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.521,1062.073,"But if you're talking... I mean, if you're talking about minority members of a jury panel."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1062.073,1062.592,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.592,1069.012,I should think it would be much easier to make out a case like that because there are not apt to be many of them on the panel.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1074.65,1076.433,"By and large, there will be."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.325,1115.375,"Even if we accepted your argument that sex should be treated like race, wouldn't it be appropriate in this case to follow another precedent that was set 27 years in Alabama, and that is not to make this... this dramatic change retroactive."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1124.748,1138.323,"I think the problem with that approach would be that the harm in this case... in this particular case, the harm, the men who were eliminated have already been damaged."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.175,1151.15,"Well, that was certainly so in the days when the Alabama laws was... that the jury role would include the names of all male citizens of the county."
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1151.15,1151.483,"--Yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1151.483,1153.733,And yet that was made prospective only.
1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1158.804,1163.973,Because the damage has occurred already and it needs to be remedied.

1993.92-1239,0,32476,john_f_porter_iii,,1170.127,1171.061,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.061,1172.646,"Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1172.646,1178.633,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.202,1238.756,"And you know better, so you want to protect defense counsel from himself, right?"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1238.756,1239.589,No.
1993.92-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.274,1246.027,It seems to me he has his client's interest more to heart than the Government does.
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1254.031,1255.467,"--Well, the same argument could be made--"
1993.92-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.467,1257.769,"And if it's unwarranted, it'll be its own punishment."
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1257.769,1265.923,"--I think the same argument could be made about racially based stereotypes or ethnically based stereotypes, or stereotypes based on a person's religion and nothing more."
1993.92-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.691,1272.262,There's a Thirteenth Amendment and a Fourteenth Amendment that can account for our view of racially based stereotypes.
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1283.384,1299.079,"--Well, this Court has determined that the Equal Protection Clause not only applies to sex-based classifications, but that they are entitled to heightened scrutiny because there has been a history of discrimination and a history that reflects the misuse of gender-based stereotypes as a basis for Government action."
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1309.702,1333.3,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, if you... if you prevail here, if the petitioner prevails, and not only gender-based peremptory strikes but those based on ethnic origin, religion and so forth, are similarly barred, what's left of the peremptory challenge system, if anything?"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1333.3,1335.269,"I think what's left of it, Justice O'Connor--"
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1335.269,1336.502,Besides the postmen.
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1337.704,1346.227,"--It is the important class of postmen, and in addition classes that are based similarly on occupation, and all classes that really have not been elevated--"
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1346.227,1346.743,Well--
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1346.743,1347.777,--To heightened review.
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1347.777,1366.371,"--It strikes me that before you even get to that, you're going to be accused... as a lawyer, a trial lawyer exercising peremptories which, of necessity, have to be exercised against either women or men... of having made a sex-based peremptory strike."
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1387.118,1391.986,The trial judge will have the discretion to determine whether there's a prima facie case.
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1403.044,1403.611,But it might.
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1403.611,1404.361,--It might.
1993.92-1239,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.195,1431.647,"Well, but, of course, what do you have there?"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1460.73,1464.618,--There may be some cases that call for difficult determinations at the margins.
1993.92-1239,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.07,1469.453,"Mr. Dreeben, are we talking entirely hypothetically?"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1474.74,1475.676,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.785,1493.387,"Well, but--"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1508.813,1522.055,"So long as the litigant relies on a basis for the challenge which is not in a category that's protected by heightened scrutiny, and in which we are particularly concerned about the invidious use of stereotypes, in which the jurors rights would be violated were he subject to exclusion."
1993.92-1239,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1522.055,1523.59,Is it just the jurors' rights?
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1537.48,1547.288,"I'm not sure that the actual accuracy of the fact-finding process is necessarily affected one way or the other, so long as impartial jurors are actually seated."
1993.92-1239,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1552.426,1558.33,"Well, do you think the stereotypes may, then, enhance the accuracy of the jury?"
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1558.33,1561.365,"No, I don't think that the stereotypes would in any way enhance it."
1993.92-1239,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1562.915,1564.917,But you wouldn't go so far as to say they retard it?
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1564.917,1566.134,--Not necessarily.
1993.92-1239,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1583.111,1588.949,"Well, this goes back to Justice Souter's question to the previous counsel as to what the real evil is here."
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1602.875,1611.029,"I think the line should be drawn, Justice Kennedy, where this Court has drawn it in other equal protection contexts where stereotyping was used to justify laws."
1993.92-1239,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1637.096,1648.988,But isn't the purpose of abolishing the stereotype from the courtroom in order to confirm the duty of the individual juror to set aside his or her own preconceptions?
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1648.988,1659.461,"--That is certainly part of it, but there is a balancing going on here, and the peremptory challenge system has been thought to serve other purposes in the jury selection process."
1993.92-1239,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.829,1715.781,But by retroactive you mean the cases pending?
1993.92-1239,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1715.781,1718.15,"--to cases pending, that's precisely correct, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1239,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.265,1744.015,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1746.4,1752.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.859,1814.627,"That's what Alabama allows in a criminal case, or is this a civil case?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1814.627,1816.913,"--This is a civil case completely, Your Honor."
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.913,1819.865,And you're allowed 10 or 11 strikes in a civil case?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1819.865,1834.875,They use a struck jury method which is 24... a minimum of 24 are required from which to start the striking down to the number of jurors that are going to be needed.
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.875,1839.929,"Well, if you start with 24 and one side has 10 and the other side has 11--"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1839.929,1840.695,"No, no, no."
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.551,1851.752,--And would that be 12 in this case?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1851.752,1852.952,--In this case it was 12.
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.233,1875.352,"Well, let me inquire once more into the mechanics."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1879.47,1880.756,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.056,1886.993,And you... where did the number 24 come from?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1886.993,1892.479,--The statute requires that a minimum of 24 be available.
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.352,1903.752,Thank you.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,1903.752,1917.512,"The State used its fourth strike to strike a woman, but the defendant continued to use his strikes... I mean to strike a man, but the defendant continued to use her to strike women."
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2003.468,2011.14,"Are you suggesting that there was not proof that the elimination was, indeed, gender based?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2011.14,2021.429,--I'm not suggesting that there would not have been a prima facie case which would have caused a challenge if Batson had been applied to this case.
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.429,2024.298,That's... I thought that that was a given for us at this level.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2024.298,2024.798,Yes.
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2041.593,2070.344,"Ms. Brasle... Brasfield, my question to you... we've been talking about stereotyping and how they are often true for most people in the class, but it was my impression that the evil or mischief that has underlied every decision of this Court in the sex discrimination/equal protection field is just that stereotyping, the notion that women are this way and men are that way."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2071.695,2081.237,"In my position, I think that that is correct."
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.302,2109.137,How long were women kept off juries in Alabama?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2109.137,2113.791,"--Until 1966, they were."
1993.92-1239,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.086,2137.054,But you're arguing that there's nothing wrong with a counsel that's continuing to exclude them solely on the basis of their gender?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2137.054,2140.691,I'm not saying that that's right or wrong.
1993.92-1239,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.741,2142.158,No.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2144.41,2147.445,"--I'm saying... I'm not... well, that's what I mean."
1993.92-1239,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2163.222,2166.324,Are you asking that Batson be overruled?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2166.324,2167.676,"--Not at all, sir."
1993.92-1239,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2169.243,2170.978,You accept... you accept Batson?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2170.978,2171.578,--Yes.
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2187.404,2203.682,"Well, Ms. Brasfield, I guess the Court has painted itself into a bit of a corner on this matter, because it has held that the Batson rule applies because of the right of the juror."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2223.095,2224.329,I don't think--
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2224.329,2227.897,I think what's really at stake is the right of the juror.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2233.051,2233.818,--Well--
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.818,2240.455,But how can you make a reasonable argument in light of the Court's jurisprudence here?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2240.455,2246.276,"--Well, I think that no particular juror has a right to sit on any particular case."
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.654,2271.91,"Yes, but a particular juror has a right to have the State not act to exclude them on the basis of their gender, right?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2271.91,2279.099,That has not been said by this Court up until now.
1993.92-1239,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2286.686,2287.486,Yes.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2290.638,2299.493,Then I think you would have to come also to the right of the postman and the right of anybody else not to be struck.
1993.92-1239,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2311.487,2312.92,It's not a right not to be a struck.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2324.061,2325.345,--But is it--
1993.92-1239,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.345,2330.799,It's the reason for the challenge that's the point of... the point of the inquiry here.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2330.799,2342.356,"--But I think that the same argument, if that is going to be used to extend Batson, would also apply to any other stereotypical reason for--"
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.356,2350.278,"Ms. Brasfield, isn't it true that there's no other group in the history of this country that was excluded from jury service as long as women?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2359.984,2376.846,"--Justice Ginsburg, it is true that only blacks and women have, been under the law, denied the right, and that actually black men were allowed to sit on juries prior to women in Alabama."
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.846,2390.42,--So wouldn't we be putting the peremptory challenge back where it was in the days when it was never exercised on the basis of either race or sex because there weren't any women or any minorities in the pool to begin with?
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2397.593,2403.228,"But they are there, and they are there in fairly equal numbers."
1993.92-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.682,2452.411,"Ms. Brasfield, I suppose that every citizen has a right not only not to be... if we follow this logic, not only not to be stricken for that citizen's race, religion, sex, and whatever, but also has a right not to be stricken for any irrational reason, I suppose, if that logic is correct?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2454.78,2456.18,I think that--
1993.92-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.18,2463.201,So I guess that every erroneous basis for exercising peremptories would be unconstitutional.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2471.891,2475.776,"--I think that that argument could be extended in that direction, yes."
1993.92-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.776,2477.878,Or just striking a juror because you don't like the look in his eye.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2479.895,2493.821,"I think that we would certainly be in a position where we couldn't use... striking a jury because we don't like the look in his eye as our nonracial, non-gender-based reason--"
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.821,2494.505,"Well, you could--"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2494.505,2495.59,--Because it would be considered a sham.
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.59,2512.801,"--Well, you could draw the line short of that, surely, because the Court has held the Equal Protection Clause requires if not strict scrutiny, at least heightened scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny based on differences between men and women."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2519.338,2520.972,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.574,2523.007,Or about letter carriers.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2523.007,2525.376,--That is also correct.
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2579.994,2591.318,"Ms. Brasfield, is the question I asked earlier to Mr. Dreeben, I think... Batson is in effect with respect to sex in the Ninth Circuit and in some States."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2601.174,2607.68,--I am not familiar with whether those problems have been found.
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.077,2667.468,"Well, and I also think that the Ninth Circuit adopted its rule, as I understand it, only in 1992, last year, so it might be too soon to decide whether there've been any problems or not."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2667.468,2670.353,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I agree with that."
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2759.828,2767.1,"Well, may I ask you, in the trial of those cases is the fact pattern that we've seen in this case characteristic of most of them?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2767.1,2770.286,The fact pattern in this case--
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2770.286,2774.588,"I mean, defense counsel will strike all of one sex and the State's counsel strike all of the other sex?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2774.588,2781.677,--This is the first case that I have seen where that type of striking has been apparent.
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2781.677,2785.045,So this isn't necessarily a problem here for--
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2785.045,2786.161,So this is not necessarily.
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2797.45,2812.811,"--But that sort of undercuts the reason for your fear that if we... if we decide in the petitioner's favor here, that your prosecution of these cases is going to be made unmanageable?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2812.811,2821.148,The only thing that would make it unmanageable is that the... if you reduced either side.
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.296,2840.562,If it appears to be.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2871.665,2876.152,"--No, not that one strike of one person would."
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.373,2883.658,And they were all of the same gender.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2883.658,2884.241,--They are one--
1993.92-1239,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2884.241,2885.125,Then you've got one.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2885.125,2889.478,"--You know, at what point would you decide you've crossed the line?"
1993.92-1239,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.37,2934.673,"May I ask you a question about your procedure in Alabama, this alternate striking?"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2945.445,2946.564,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1239,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2953.385,2953.601,I see.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2957.936,2958.371,That's right.
1993.92-1239,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.542,2966.492,I see.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,2994.628,3009.054,The proportion of minorities to the majority race on the venire is considered as one of the elements.
1993.92-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.397,3062.438,"And one could hardly afford to apply that rigorous a rule to another category of strikes, or at least another major one as sizeable as sex discrimination."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3062.438,3064.455,I think that that is true.
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3130.849,3148.794,"Justice O'Connor explained that the... one of the problems from your point of view is that the right is being asserted by the defendant, but the constitutional protection is afforded to the potential juror."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3166.672,3168.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3267.121,3279.596,"So if there is a constitutional injury and it's a problem of the mechanics of the State system that could be fixed, as seems to be your--"
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3279.596,3284.766,"Then I think Alabama deserves an opportunity to try to fix that, if that is what is happening."
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3284.766,3290.086,"--Well, certainly, there would be an impetus to fix it if the Court said that Batson applies to gender."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3291.036,3299.859,I think there would be an impetus to go to proportional juries or do away with the peremptory strike.
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3303.228,3306.263,"I'm sorry, I wasn't... perhaps I didn't understand you correctly."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3321.106,3325.326,--Uh--
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3325.326,3339.067,"So that if you... if you fixed the way your... you strike jurors, then you might not have any difficulty administering Batson for race or for sex."
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3339.067,3339.669,--But I--
1993.92-1239,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3339.669,3340.903,I thought that's what you had said.
1993.92-1239,2,34124,lois_n_brasfield,,3340.903,3361.017,"--Yes, that is what I said, but I do think that because it is already the... the problem of gender strikes in Alabama is not a pervasive problem, that the State should have the opportunity to try to correct it on its own."
1993.92-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.711,3409.828,"Thank you, Ms. Brasfield."
