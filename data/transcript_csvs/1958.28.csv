1958.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.388,"Number 28, Maxine K. Hinkle, Administratrix of the Estate of W. Max Hinkle, deceased, petitioner versus New England Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston, Massachusetts."
1958.28,0,34438,leland_s_forrest,,15.167,15.539,Mr. Chief Justice –
1958.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,15.539,16.422,-- you may proceed.
1958.28,0,34438,leland_s_forrest,,16.422,20.588,-- may it please the Court.
1958.28,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,193.651,200.712,"(Inaudible) lawyer and the Court of Appeals who wrote this opinion was an Iowa lawyer, is that right?"
1958.28,0,34438,leland_s_forrest,,200.712,223.803,"That is where I made my mistake in the oral argument and of course that did create I think considerable prejudice in the part of the Iowa judge against the man from the Missouri and I think that is one of the reasons I claim it wasn't due process of law, because then when you emphasis the fact where the judge came from, then you haven't got due process of law, but (Inaudible) prejudice."
1958.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,324.922,328.021,Would you think that Judge Hand was an average man?
1958.28,0,34438,leland_s_forrest,,328.021,330.612,"No, but he didn't do this which the Court of Appeals did."
1958.28,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,513.604,514.831,What are you reading from?
1958.28,0,34438,leland_s_forrest,,514.831,519.984,"This is from the (Inaudible) case cited in my brief, (Inaudible) against the Fire Insurance Company."
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,976.215,980.326,"Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1958.28,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1681.347,1683.085,Why was he not insurable there?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1683.085,1691.31,He had a previous history of heart trouble which he had denied in the application and which appeared from the proofs of death.
1958.28,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1691.31,1693.283,But was he insurable?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1693.283,1695.123,"No sir, because of his past medical history."
1958.28,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1695.123,1697.358,He Couldn't have gotten the policy?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1697.358,1699.61,"No sir, they have (Inaudible)"
1958.28,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1699.61,1701.165,Impossible for him to get a policy?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1701.165,1723.82,"Well I mean if -- it's not (Inaudible), he might have got one with a rating for bad health, a rate up policy, what they call a substandard policy that didn't appear, but they found that he was not insurable because of his past record of heart trouble and several serious heart attacks."
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1782.404,1783.137,Mr. Henry –
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1783.137,1783.625,Yes sir.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1783.625,1795.558,"-- may I ask you sir, you referred to the answer on -- to question 17 on the application 70 -- exhibit 2 on page 20."
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1800.929,1802.335,Not in the view of the court.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1869.247,1892.164,"Here is what I mean to get to, as I have done a little looking at this record and there was some evidence that this answer to question 17 may not have been Mr. Hinkle's answer, but the answer written in by the agent."
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1912.141,1922.622,"I don't think so Your Honor, because as I say, in the view that both the trial court and the lower court made, it make any difference."
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1984.952,1992.486,Well there wouldn't have been any representation in that respect although absent a negative answer to question 17.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,1992.486,1995.786,That's right sir.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2032.837,2045.047,"The fact of his non-insurability, I'm having a little difficult with this, was not bad health, it was merely that he did some flying and in the answer to question 17 said he did not."
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2045.047,2050.991,"Didn't matter whether there had been -- if Your Honor please, suppose there had been no question at that time."
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2050.991,2051.511,Yes.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2051.511,2068.138,"And suppose that then, the inspection report had disclosed that he was a pilot and owned his own plane, and the company had then refused to issue the policy, that would have been, because he was uninsurable regardless of whether he said he said he was pilot or not a pilot."
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2068.138,2074.074,But as in this case when he died the next day by an accident.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2074.074,2077.643,And we say that he was not -- and we would have said he was non-insurable.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2077.643,2086.723,"But he had made no representations though in the assumption we make now, that this was not his answer to question 17 that did not fly."
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2086.723,2094.706,"That doesn't make any difference if Your Honor please, whether it was the fact, not a misrepresentation as to the fact."
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2120.695,2136.934,"Well isn't it true that in the absence of some such representations in the application, are absent some condition excusing liability in the conditional receipt, the company would be liable if he were killed the next day?"
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2136.934,2138.233,Yes sir.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2138.233,2139.284,Well then do you find (Inaudible) –
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2139.284,2141.962,The condition was in the receipt.
1958.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2141.962,2142.973,In the receipt?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2142.973,2144.293,Yes sir.
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2169.022,2178.228,How about those words -- I was going to say how about those words like immediate coverage that appeared in there apparently in the handwriting of the agent.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2178.228,2182.685,Now I call your attention to that and I call your attention to where it occurs.
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2182.685,2183.067,Yes.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2183.067,2200.693,"It occurs under the amount, now the testimony was that the agent explained to Hinkle that this policy started at $10,500 and then it went down $500 a year."
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2219.499,2226.05,"Does that term express immediate coverage, does that express that fact?"
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2226.05,2227.01,No sir.
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2255.262,2259.404,"It's not a usual thing for them to do, to put that immediate coverage?"
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2259.404,2269.397,"Well you might say this is rather an unusual type of policy because when you pick out $1,000 of insurance, you think that yourself is having taken out $1,000 of insurance."
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2302.11,2306.096,But do you think that those words convey that meaning?
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2306.096,2310.517,"Well, I will say it to Your Honor that I don't think the words add anything."
1958.28,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2366.654,2371.555,You are arguing -- your answer is so this is a general question of law.
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2375.586,2376.173,I say that.
1958.28,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2377.235,2378.903,(Inaudible)
1958.28,1,38001,phineas_m_henry,,2378.903,2396.525,"I say its answered by the (Inaudible) and as to the immediate coverage, that of course was not covered and the district court, said that, that adding nothing to the receipt and that he submitted to the jury on that point."
1958.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2715.949,2716.709,Mr. Forrest.
1958.28,2,34438,leland_s_forrest,,2716.709,2718.334,May it please the Court.
1958.28,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3460.592,3466.69,Did you know that judge (Inaudible) at one time was British Commissioner?
1958.28,2,34438,leland_s_forrest,,3466.69,3477.524,"No, I did not, I didn't know anything about it and I had no means and I don't think that it's proper for them to bring in here because we are not having any insurance investigator."
1958.28,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3581.704,3584.332,(Inaudible) statement about the –
1958.28,2,34438,leland_s_forrest,,3584.332,3585.238,I beg your pardon.
1958.28,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3585.238,3587.223,I want to ask you one statement about the --
1958.28,2,34438,leland_s_forrest,,3587.223,3589.009,Yes.
1958.28,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3589.009,3599.171,"The court there relied in part (Inaudible) on Section 1750, Code of 1897 (Inaudible)."
1958.28,2,34438,leland_s_forrest,,3603.434,3606.961,"Well I wouldn't, I wouldn't be prepared to answer except this."
