2016.14-1538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.535,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-1538, Life Technologies Corporation v. Promega Corporation. Mr. Phillips."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,9.535,24.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think because this is largely an international trade case, it's probably useful to put this case in context and to compare it to the facts that gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that's at issue in this case."
2016.14-1538,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.91,150.32,Could you tell us --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,150.32,150.94,-- a violation.
2016.14-1538,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.94,153.605,-- is this product available outside the U.S.?
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,153.605,155.01,Taq polymerase?
2016.14-1538,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,155.01,155.36,Yes.
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,155.36,156.12,Absolutely.
2016.14-1538,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,162.13,164.08,There's no patent on that particular component?
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,164.08,166.26,"No, none that -- none that exists any longer, no."
2016.14-1538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.69,177.65,Do we know why that particular component was exported from the United States? You -- you said all the others --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,177.65,177.86,Right.
2016.14-1538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.86,179.075,-- were made in England.
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,179.075,186.02,"Yeah, and the key to this is you want -- you want to get the best quality product at -- presumably, at the lowest possible price."
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.78,237.63,"If all of this had happened in the United States, would there have been a patent infringement suit that would be -- have merit?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,237.63,241.82,"Yes, if everything had take -- taken place inside the United States, there would have been."
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.82,247.73,"Under the U.K. laws, are patents generally enforced for items that are patentable in the U.K.?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,247.73,248.41,Yes.
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.83,285.675,"I assume, though, that there might be other countries that are not so vigorous in their enforcements as the U.K."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,285.675,292.93,"Well, I suspect that there may be, although there -- you know, this isn't broadly regulated by -- by treaties."
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,349.48,352.01,"Does ""substantial portion"" mean a majority?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,352.01,354.96,"Oh, I think it means substantially more than a majority."
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,361.92,363.93,"So here, there were five components?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,363.93,364.46,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.46,368.51,And -- and they would have to be -- all -- all five would have to be made in the United States? Or --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,368.51,369.44,"Well, I -- I would -- at minimum --"
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,369.44,370.115,-- four would be enough?
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,370.115,373.3,I would have thought at least four would have to be.
2016.14-1538,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,377.88,380.15,Where -- where do you get that from? What's the principle there?
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,380.15,392.75,Because all Congress wanted to do was to close a loophole where you're essentially doing nothing but violating U.S. patent law and avoiding it by simply offloading it at the last second.
2016.14-1538,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.47,416.15,"Well, how do we know that that's all Congress wanted to do? I mean, that might have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but Congress used language that could refer to much more than that, that could refer to a majority, that even could refer to a substantial minority."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,416.15,416.51,Yeah.
2016.14-1538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.29,448.295,"And so you agree that ""substantial portion"" is an ambiguous term?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,448.295,449.47,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,485.38,485.94,But those are --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,485.94,486.32,-- to sort out.
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.32,493.425,"-- just two -- two components, the polymerase and then a -- a patent -- the -- a second part of a patent that we'll envision."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,493.425,493.75,Right.
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.87,519.495,"It seems -- it seems to me that even if we -- we agree with you that quantitative is -- is the proper measure, you still have qualitative coming in to balance your judgment, as in the case of one out of two --"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,519.495,521.59,"Well, I -- not in one out of two."
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.43,528.84,"No, no, no --"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,528.84,530.02,-- adapted or especially --
2016.14-1538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.02,531.31,"Well, I'm just talking about (f)(1)."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,531.31,531.805,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2016.14-1538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.99,566.815,I'm not sure I agree with your understanding of the extraterritorial principle.
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,599.975,605.44,"Yeah, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that's exactly the opposite of what the Court said in Microsoft."
2016.14-1538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,627.11,627.3,Well --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,627.3,628.22,-- very narrowly.
2016.14-1538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.33,659.825,"Your real argument is just that -- isn't it -- that you interpret it differently than you do, and we cause a lot of problems in other countries. I mean, they -- they can't tell whether, when they get one component, their lawyer is going to have to know not only British law, it's going to have to know American law."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,659.825,660.56,That's exactly --
2016.14-1538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.56,662.695,And -- and that's a very practical argument.
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,662.695,663.0,Right.
2016.14-1538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.0,676.54,"And it -- really, we don't need -- well, you, it's up to you what you want to use. But I don't -- you -- the problem is, if that's the point, why do you need this sort of grand thing about -- about a -- a presumption against extraterritoriality?"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,676.54,676.87,Yeah --
2016.14-1538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.87,678.41,"It's up to you what you want to use, but --"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,678.41,683.61,"Yeah, yeah, yeah -- well, look, I'm -- I'm perfectly comfortable with, really, any -- any policy argument you feel comfortable with. That one -- (Laughter.)"
2016.14-1538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.61,683.73,"Well, I --"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,683.73,710.28,"-- is certainly one that we -- we embraced. I mean, the other -- the other policy argument that seems to me equally strong in this context is the -- is the mischief that the Federal Circuit's Rule provides for trolls, because now, not only do you have all of the trolls in the world looking for all of the products in the world, but now they're going to go through the entire supply chain of every punitive infringer and go after each provider of a single staple article of commerce as part of this exercise --"
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,710.28,710.59,Do you think --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,710.59,713.06,-- and it seems to me that cannot be possibly what Congress intended.
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.06,737.23,"Do you think it's clear that the -- that the -- the qualitative interpretation has a greater extraterritorial effect than the quantitative interpretation? What if you have a situation where -- let's say there are ten components, and nine of them are -- are made overseas, but those are very routine things; those are like the product that was made in the United States here."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,749.175,750.08,Yeah.
2016.14-1538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,755.13,755.22,Right.
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,755.22,763.8,"-- and it's not -- and it doesn't satisfy ""especially made or especially adapted."" It seems to me that (f)(2) tells you specifically, that's not within the meaning of the statute."
2016.14-1538,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,763.8,764.44,"Well, I'm not sure if that's --"
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,764.44,766.395,"And if Congress wants to fix it, it can fix that."
2016.14-1538,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,766.395,768.34,"I'm not sure if that's true, Mr. Phillips."
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,825.035,825.4,Right.
2016.14-1538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.25,883.68,And what are --
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,883.68,884.55,-- quantitative analysis.
2016.14-1538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.55,891.345,What are the -- what are the components of the invention? How do we know what the -- the components of the invention?
2016.14-1538,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,891.345,904.4,"This Court in Microsoft said that the components of the invention are the elements in the claim, and so you look at the claim and you interpret the claim and you -- and you devise from that. Now, that -- that -- that's claim -- that's claim construction."
2016.14-1538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,926.61,936.375,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,936.375,945.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are asking the Court to do two things here today. First, we are asking the Court to hold that the supply of a single commodity component is never enough."
2016.14-1538,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1022.27,1042.105,"You keep saying ""substantially all."" Mr. Phillips argued that ""substantially all"" has to mean just that: Almost all. You, instead, in your brief, want us to keep that vaguer, but I'm assuming that there is a minimum that wouldn't constitute an infringement."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1042.105,1042.92,"Well, I think --"
2016.14-1538,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1042.92,1046.475,20 percent? 30 percent? 40? How -- how --
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1046.475,1054.21,"Well, so I think the -- the -- the one bright line that we -- that we are drawing here is -- on the face of the statute is that one is never enough."
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1080.53,1084.605,"Time -- time, money, and effort, but not significance of the component?"
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1084.605,1084.98,I think --
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.98,1091.36,It seems to me that the significance of the component would be the most important consideration.
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1091.43,1092.25,I think -- and so the --
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1092.25,1102.99,"If it's the -- if it's whatever you think is not quite enough, 70 percent, but 70 percent of the components -- I mean, that's really the core of what makes it work."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1110.73,1123.74,"Well, I -- I -- our principal concern or -- as I was saying, is that if you just ask the question of whether it's significant in the sense of is it essential or important to the novelty of the invention, I think that's just a black hole that's not going to get you anywhere."
2016.14-1538,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1164.09,1178.75,"To the expert testimony here that out of the five, three were significant, so let's assume they supplied the three significant components and not the two less insignificant."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1181.285,1186.56,I think that would be a much closer case to supplying something that is tantamount to supplying all of them under our test.
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.69,1214.67,"I think once you -- once you're into your fairly complicated test, I mean, I think it's -- you're off to the races."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1246.13,1277.27,"No, I -- I -- I think that what we are saying is that the -- the statute carries the quantitative meeting in the sense that it needs to be a large portion, but this is an anti-circumvention provision and then trying to figure out what it needs for it to be a large portion, the numbers are a whole lot of the picture. I -- I don't want to -- I don't want to diminish that, but as we said on page 26, we think they are not the entire ball game, and a court look at -- could look at some qualitative factors, but that it would not look at the question of whether what's left on the table is essential or in -- or to the novelty, because the answer to that is always going to be yes."
2016.14-1538,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1277.27,1282.275,I don't know enough patent law to have the answer to this.
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1297.66,1298.81,"Not as I understand it, no."
2016.14-1538,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.43,1332.16,"But why do we have to go into the details here? I mean, it did strike me as an instance where maybe the less said by us the better."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1353.995,1354.86,I -- I think --
2016.14-1538,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.86,1360.77,"All these lawyers that will be there telling them, don't get close to that, and the thing will work over time."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1370.12,1371.1,"Yeah, I -- I -- I think that --"
2016.14-1538,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.1,1372.56,That's what worries me.
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1372.56,1377.53,"I -- I think if you said that one was never enough and it needs to be a whole lot, we would be quite happy."
2016.14-1538,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.12,1378.86,End of the case.
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1382.81,1385.155,"Yeah, we -- we -- we would be perfectly happy with that. (Laughter.)"
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1385.155,1389.25,All -- all that I'm trying to do is try and give you our sort of best gloss on interpreting --
2016.14-1538,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.25,1399.19,Then why did you -- why did you add the qualification to put in qualitative considerations in addition to quantitative?
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1399.19,1408.35,"Well, as I was trying to get at with the -- the illustrations using this particular invention, like you could get to a different answer even when you have the same number of components."
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.98,1455.195,"I think that's your answer in this invention, but every other invention is going to have a different mix of the time, the effort, the, you know, qualitative aspect, and it -- again, it does seem to be that once you get beyond looking at purely quantitatively in terms of the components, I don't think you've made much progress in clearing up the -- the litigation costs and the confusion. And I'm also not sure how it fits in with the presumption against extraterritoriality, or at least the clear application of that."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1455.195,1464.125,"Well, I -- I -- I think the main thing that we are getting at is that -- and -- and -- and again, as I was saying, I -- I don't think we have a strong -- strong position on how exactly you -- you articulate the test."
2016.14-1538,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1474.19,1484.14,"Because there's a reason why it's that almost all. I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into government work, how many would I mean?"
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1484.14,1495.96,"Well, I -- I think with any of these things, the interpretation of substantial depends entirely on its context and its purpose, and -- and -- and so this term is used in just, like, a countless array of ways in the law."
2016.14-1538,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1495.96,1502.47,"So you're not pinning this on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion means almost all?"
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1502.47,1502.975,"Well, no --"
2016.14-1538,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1502.975,1506.38,You are finding it from someplace else? And where are you finding it from?
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1506.38,1520.24,So we're trying to give a gloss on substantiality in light of the context and purpose of this statue as -- as we understand all of 271(f) is designed to shore up the basic restrictioning and is actually making a patented invention in the United States and then shipping it abroad.
2016.14-1538,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1526.08,1537.415,"But then you take Justice Alito's hypothetical, which is a product where there's a single product that is accounting for 90 percent of the time and effort, and whatever the third thing you mentioned was."
2016.14-1538,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1537.415,1542.23,"I think in -- in -- in the one is never enough, (f)(2) was just a complete answer to that."
2016.14-1538,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.575,1561.105,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1561.105,1579.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's extremely important to understand how fundamentally the Petitioners and the government misapprehend the nature of the harm that Congress addressed in 271 as enacted."
2016.14-1538,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1698.11,1714.41,"You're -- but you're -- you're beginning with a dialogue at a Senate hearing on the bill that's pretty weak even in the legislative history hierarchy, but I don't think you've mentioned the actual language of the statute yet."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1714.41,1716.48,"Well, that -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1720.85,1734.65,"Well, how does it help you? Because I -- it's very hard for me to believe that Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American patent law so that it runs the world when we've entered into a treaty which says British patent law runs Britain, French France, and so forth."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1746.6,1773.375,"So, Justice Breyer, before I go back to the history, I'll take the Chief Justice's admonition and -- and -- and focus on the language. I mentioned the history, Mr. Chief Justice, only because it's rare that an exchange in the legislative history translates so directly to the language of the statute as a result of that exchange which we're not relying on as interpretive authority. Senator Mathias did exactly what the United States suggested."
2016.14-1538,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.46,1796.35,"Well, I know."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1821.035,1821.45,Okay.
2016.14-1538,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1849.69,1891.23,"What about the -- what about the text of the -- of the statute? It doesn't say ""a substantial portion of the patented invention."" It says ""a substantial portion of the components"" of -- of the patented invention. So if I were to -- you know, if I were to ask, what is a substantial portion of the pages of your brief, I think someone would think that's a quantitative determination and -- and would not think that, well, you know, I think pages 12 to 16 of your brief are particularly important, so that would be a substantial portion of the -- of the pages of your brief."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1891.23,1919.845,"So I -- let me go first to the -- to the question about the use of the word ""components"" rather than ""invention"" and then address your -- your question on the substantial number of pages. As this Court explained in Microsoft v. AT&T, the use of the word ""components"" is the -- is Congress's indication that the combinations that are precluded are tangible or physical combinations, not method patents or unembodied software."
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.62,2085.725,"What do you do -- what do you do with the word ""all""? I take it your argument would be easier if that word were not in the statute."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2085.725,2091.48,I don't -- I don't -- I'm not -- I don't -- I don't agree that our argument would be easier.
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.07,2162.07,Is it against the law? Which I don't know.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2186.53,2196.93,"It is not for two reasons. One, what -- what you have to show under 271(f) is the act of active inducement that is --"
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.93,2199.01,What -- what he does is just as I said.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2202.12,2202.25,Okay.
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.81,2204.985,"In England, it's not patented."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2224.94,2230.02,So there you would ask the question whether the component or two components --
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.02,2231.31,If we leave the component out of it.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2234.105,2234.66,Okay.
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.01,2235.35,Is that illegal?
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2235.35,2243.05,"-- not illegal, because in addition to active inducement, you also have to supply a substantial portion of the component."
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.05,2243.5,Exactly.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2243.5,2243.94,"Now, after that --"
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.94,2252.61,So then the question becomes one of what limits Congress wanted to put in an area where it isn't illegal.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2255.36,2256.1,So if the --
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.1,2256.435,Yeah.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2256.825,2272.385,"Sorry. If the component is -- let me use two examples: One, I'll adopt Justice Alito's hypothetical. Let's assume that you have a patented pharmaceutical, a tablet that, you know, remediates a disease."
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.77,2472.565,So how do you decide -- here there are five.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2472.565,2473.51,Yeah.
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.51,2480.02,And only one is manufactured in the United States.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2480.02,2480.86,So --
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.86,2495.915,"Under your test, where there are five, and let's assume that each one is necessary to the operation of the patented device, how do you decide if one is substantial, one out of five?"
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2495.915,2516.56,"I -- I'm going to answer your question, but first of all, let me simply correct a couple of statements by my friend, I think in response to your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg. The evidence in this case was that as to 300-plus million of the 700 million in sales, two components were supplied."
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.3,2608.72,And what were the instructions?
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2608.72,2609.15,Excuse me?
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2609.15,2612.145,How -- how in the world would a jury go about deciding that?
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2612.145,2626.665,"Well, it's interesting in this case because for other reasons, Life Technologies at other points of the trial wanted to emphasize just how important and unique this form of Taq was."
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2659.07,2660.405,Let's assume the --
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2660.405,2662.61,"If I could just finish my sentence, and then I'll --"
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.61,2663.34,Sure.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2663.34,2666.95,The Federal Circuit dealt with this as a substantial evidence question.
2016.14-1538,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2694.92,2698.575,I think you've finished -- I think you've finished your sentence. So -- (Laughter.)
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2698.575,2701.545,Thank you very much. Justice Sotomayor?
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2701.545,2724.615,"It seems to me that what you -- you appear to be saying is still not answering your adversary's position. If there are, as I understood the expert testimony from the briefing -- and I could be wrong, and you'll correct me on that -- but assume my hypothetical, that there are three substantial components in this invention."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2755.17,2768.29,"So it's not part of our argument, and we don't think it's a fair reading of the Federal Circuit's decision, that says, look, if the thing won't work without a component, it's a substantial portion of the component."
2016.14-1538,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2863.98,2874.735,"Well, in order to do that, it would be necessary to know what ""a substantial portion of the components"" means. So what would you tell a jury that means?"
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2874.735,2885.575,"So I would tell a jury, you know, following the dictionary definitions, that ""substantial"" means considerable in importance and/or amount."
2016.14-1538,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2997.53,2998.13,Do they have to figure --
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2998.13,3014.82,"They have to go beyond that and actively encourage, send instructions or blueprints or something, in order to do it, and a jury, properly instructed, based on the evidence, has to ascertain, gee, this really is a substantial portion."
2016.14-1538,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3014.82,3015.15,"Well, that -- that --"
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3015.15,3016.08,This is the molecule.
2016.14-1538,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3016.08,3032.0,"That -- that -- that sounds to me much more like (f)(2) than (f)(1), but I'll -- I'll -- I'll look at that. The -- the -- the brief by Agilent Technologies was instructive for me as to how modern supply chains work."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3055.665,3057.7,"I -- I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3140.62,3150.15,"-- that responded to the government's suggestion like, let's just have (f)(2), and said, well, we need -- we need (f)(1), too."
2016.14-1538,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3176.65,3180.46,If you need -- you need (f)(1) to -- to -- to overturn Deepsouth.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3180.46,3182.34,"Oh, no, no, not at all."
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.98,3227.24,"That's U.S. conduct, but you read the brief of the German companies, and they said it's a fairly common thing."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3249.04,3249.57,Justice Breyer --
2016.14-1538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3249.57,3251.21,"So they are worried about it, in other words."
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3251.21,3257.295,I -- I think that I -- I -- I don't think that their worry is validated by a correct understanding of the statute.
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3328.74,3329.5,Mr. Waxman --
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3329.5,3330.15,-- the notion -- I'm --
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3330.15,3344.49,"-- if Life Technologies sold this polymer to another company that it hadn't had a relationship with, would that other company be considered to be infringing?"
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3344.49,3345.43,No.
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3349.01,3349.51,This company --
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3349.51,3350.72,-- from the United States --
2016.14-1538,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3350.72,3368.945,"Any other company but Life Technologies could have taken this expired patent in England and brought all of these -- this component, this polymer, from the United States, and it wouldn't be liable? What would --"
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3368.945,3371.56,The importation of the -- may I finish?
2016.14-1538,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3371.56,3371.945,Sure.
2016.14-1538,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3371.945,3375.36,The importation of the polymer is not reached.
