1974.73-1018,1,19253,charles_e_hamilton,,1808.755,1821.228,"Yes sir but that’s not in a particular statutory procedure which allows -- which first of all gives a defendant the choice about whether or not to plead that defense and if so, then he is subjected to the following conditions."

1974.73-1018,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3452.433,3454.686,He was given a hearing?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3454.686,3469.582,He was given right to come into the -- before the joint tribal council and the record show that he isn’t given the right to cross-examine witnesses the record as in Wyoming.

1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3529.482,3532.476,I don’t -- I think it was presented but I don’t know how much --
1974.73-1018,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3532.476,3534.099,The truth is you weren’t there.
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3534.099,3534.983,"No, I wasn’t there, sir."
1974.73-1018,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3551.183,3554.429,Denied that under this statute?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3557.807,3559.079,The difference between the Wyoming --
1974.73-1018,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3559.079,3561.76,Has Wyoming denied that under the statute?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3563.749,3564.515,"Well, it’s our position that --"

1974.73-1018,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3566.442,3568.75,"Well, what are you complaining about?"
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3568.75,3581.449,It’s our position that the land in question is fee-patented and that the State of Wyoming had so an exclosure jurisdiction over that liquor license.
1974.73-1018,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.449,3591.597,I take it your point to be that Wyoming doesn’t have to share the powers issue of liquor licenses with anyone including the United States of America.
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3591.597,3593.383,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1018,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3593.383,3598.8,And that somebody that you deem worthy of a license should have -- in your state should have a license?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3598.8,3599.343,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1018,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3599.343,3601.937,And should not be deprived of it by an Indian tribe?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3601.937,3602.402,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1018,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3602.402,3606.62,If he’s a non-Indian operating on his own fee-patented land?
1974.73-1018,2,33033,jerome_f_statkus,,3606.62,3608.744,Yes.
1974.73-1018,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.89,3619.374,"Of course, it’s a very short time."
