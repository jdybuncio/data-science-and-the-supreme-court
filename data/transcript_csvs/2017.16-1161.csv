2017.16-1161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.96,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1161, Gill versus Whitford. Mr. Tseytlin?"
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,6.96,18.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has never uncovered judicially manageable standards for determining when politicians have acted too politically in drawing district lines."
2017.16-1161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.68,57.88,I -- I think it's true that there's no case that directly helps Respondents very strongly on the standing issue.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,82.8,84.6,"No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,120.76,141.8,"Well, but I -- I think the argument is pretty straightforward which you, in your district, have a right of association and you want to exercise that right of association with other people elsewhere in the state. And if you can't challenge the districting throughout the state, then your claim seems to be -- there's no way for to you to raise your claim."
2017.16-1161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.8,151.32,"And this of course -- and this of course confines it to the state and eliminates the problem of out-of-state, as the way the Chief Justice stated the hypothetical."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,151.32,158.24,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it would solve the interstate problem because, of course, the structural relationship of, for example, Mr. --"
2017.16-1161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.24,161.12,Let's -- let's assume that it does. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,161.12,198.56,"Well -- well, Your Honor, I still think that this Court should be very careful about enacting that kind of doctrine. As we know, race and politics are often correlated in this country, so political gerrymandering claims and racially gerrymandering claims, even if they're ultimately grounded in a different constitutional amendment, will often be raised together. And it cannot be -- possibly be the case that, if there's a showing that the map drawer turned on the racial screen, the person is limited to a single district claim. But if that same map drawer turned on the political screen, then the plaintiff would get access to the holy grail of a statewide claim based on --"
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.56,199.0,I'm not --
2017.16-1161,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,199.0,225.4,"On the question of -- of race, some years ago, this Court dealt with what the -- the so-called ""max-Black"" plan, said it was a deliberate attempt by the legislature to make as many African American districts as possible. This bears a certain resemblance because the effort here, intentionally, was to create as many Republican districts."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,231.92,252.24,"Well, Your Honor, that turns to the issue of justiciability, and I do not think that raises the same problems because, of course, politics is not a suspect classification like race. And I think the easiest way to see this is to take a look at a chart that Plaintiff's own expert created, and that's available on Supplemental Appendix 235."
2017.16-1161,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.04,355.44,"Before you get too deeply into the merits, which I -- I assume you'll want to do in a minute, can I just ask you a question about standing along the lines of those asked by my colleagues? Suppose that it was alleged that town officials in someplace in northern Wisconsin where the Republicans predominate were discriminating against the Democratic candidate for a legislative district by, let's say, not allowing that candidate's signs to be put up along the roadsides, but allowing the Republican signs to be put up along the roadsides, or they were pressuring town -- let's just leave it at that. They're discriminating with respect to these signs."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,376.52,392.12,"I would certainly think, Your Honor, the candidate would have standing, and I -- I'm not so sure about the voters in the district, but probably. But certainly, voters in Milwaukee who don't vote for that candidate, they're not eligible to vote for that candidate any more than someone in California is eligible to vote for that candidate. And I think we see this from --"
2017.16-1161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.12,392.32,Wait.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,395.56,423.04,"Would not have standing. And I -- I think we see this from the testimony of -- of the lead plaintiff, who is the only plaintiff that testified in this case. He was asked, during his testimony, what harm does Act 43 put on you, given that you live in a Democratic-dominated district in Madison under any possible map. Well, he said, I want to be able to campaign for a majority in assembly, which shows that his injury has nothing to do with him as a voter."
2017.16-1161,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.16,433.28,May I --
2017.16-1161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.28,437.04,"I think we're anxious to get to the merits, but one more thing on the sign."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,444.96,457.28,"I think that one could frame a hypothetical where, if it was some sort of a home rule thing, where Milwaukee's right to have certain height buildings was affected, you could have a no longer generalized interest, but we don't have anything like that here."
2017.16-1161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.28,458.44,All right.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,623.68,649.32,"Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like to talk about the third and fourth aspects of that because I think those are -- I've already talked about the second a little bit. But with regard to the third, which is persistence, that is exactly the kind of conjectural, hypothetical state of affairs inquiry that was submitted to this Court in LULAC in Professor King's amicus brief because, of course, as your suggestion -- suggested steps recognize, a single election doesn't mean much."
2017.16-1161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,667.16,726.56,"Well, if I could just stop you there for a second, because I was under the impression that legislators are capable of doing this actually pretty easily now. You know, the world of voting technology has changed a great deal, and when legislatures think about drawing these maps, they're not only thinking about the next election, they're thinking often -- not always -- but often about the election after that and the election after that and the election after that, and they do sensitivity testing, and they use other methods in order to ensure that certain results will obtain not only in the next one but eight years down the road. And it seems to me that, just as legislatures do that, in order to entrench majorities -- or minorities, as the case may be -- in order to entrench a party in power, so, too, those same techniques, which have become extremely sophisticated, can be used to evaluate what they're doing."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,726.56,732.0,"Well, Your Honor, legislatures don't have to worry about judicial manageability standards."
2017.16-1161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.48,743.32,"What -- what I'm suggesting is that this is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again."
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,746.8,749.0,"Well, Your Honor, they're just estimates."
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,751.4,761.04,I'm sorry. They're -- they're estimates where you haven't put any social scientist to say that the estimate's wrong.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,827.84,828.8,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.8,834.0,-- partisan asymmetry and unconstitutional gerrymandering?
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,834.0,853.08,"Well, Your Honor, I think the facts in this case, which is what you were discussing, are significantly less troubling than the facts in the cases that this Court has previously faced, for example, Bandemer and Vieth, and that's for two reasons. One, the map drawers here complied fastidiously with traditional districting principles, which was not true in Bandemer and Vieth."
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,853.08,858.6,But they kept going back to fix the map to make it more gerrymandered.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,877.76,878.28,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,879.32,881.56,So why didn't they take one of the earlier maps?
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,881.56,885.48,Because there was no constitutional requirement that they do so. They complied with all state law.
2017.16-1161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,885.48,886.04,That's the point.
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,886.04,888.52,And they complied with all traditional districting principles.
2017.16-1161,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,888.52,911.76,"Can I take you back to -- to Justice Kagan's question about the legislators' use of these techniques? Are all the techniques that are used by politicians in order to try to maximize their chances of electoral success scientific? I think they rely a lot on polls, don't they? How scientific have they proven to be?"
2017.16-1161,0,62823,misha_tseytlin,,911.76,917.08,"Of course, Your Honor. Legislatures can very much rest on conjecture, whereas courts cannot."
2017.16-1161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,919.0,928.24,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murphy."
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,928.24,955.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiffs have not identified a workable standard for determining when the inherently political task of districting becomes too political for the Constitution to tolerate. Indeed, the only thing Plaintiffs have added to the mix since LULAC is a wasted votes test that identifies court-drawn maps as enduring partisan gerrymanders and conveniently favors their own political party."
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.96,958.04,You've probably considered the hypo many times.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,976.12,988.36,"I think if -- if you have something that says the ultimate principle that we're going to follow is abandon all other criteria in favor of partisan advantage, at least you're closer at that point --"
2017.16-1161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.36,990.68,I don't think -- I don't think that was the question.
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.92,1008.08,This is mandated by the state constitution.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1008.08,1023.12,"I don't think that in a world where the legislature is required to and is, in fact, complying with a number of other metrics and is as one of those things taking into account partisan advantage, that you've proven a constitutional violation."
2017.16-1161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1023.12,1025.16,It's not a -- that's not a manageable standard.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1032.2,1032.52,If it's --
2017.16-1161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1032.52,1034.92,That seems like a perfectly manageable standard.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1034.92,1035.24,If it's on --
2017.16-1161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1035.24,1036.12,You cannot have that.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1036.12,1041.4,"-- the face of the statute, I think you have a different scenario because at least at that point, you know the intent."
2017.16-1161,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1048.44,1055.44,"Well, there are plenty areas of law, Ms. Murphy, where we look at intent beyond the face of a statute."
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1096.04,1114.4,"I think what differentiates this from a lot of other contexts is that here we have opinion after opinion from this Court, dissenting opinions, concurring opinions, plurality opinions, what have you, saying that considering politics in districting is not in and of itself inherently unconstitutional."
2017.16-1161,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1114.4,1115.12,Ms. Murphy --
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1115.12,1117.48,So just finding the intent isn't a problem.
2017.16-1161,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1117.48,1117.92,But there is a difference --
2017.16-1161,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1117.92,1119.84,I'd like to go back to Justice Breyer's question.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1156.08,1156.76,Sure.
2017.16-1161,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1194.6,1194.8,Okay.
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1212.84,1223.32,"Well, I mean, with all due respect, I -- I -- I'm not convinced that there are manageable criteria for the courts to be putting on legislatures for how to go about this process."
2017.16-1161,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1226.32,1227.24,But if you could try to answer --
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1227.24,1250.28,"But I would suggest that, you know, one of the starting points for me would have to be that traditional districting criteria should matter in the analysis. If you have a legislature that has started by saying we're going to comply with everything that we're supposed to do, not only as a legal matter, but also all of these practical constraints, we're going to draw districts that comply --"
2017.16-1161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.28,1256.84,"Ms. Murphy, because -- because your time is running out, I would like to ask you what's really behind all of this."
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1298.84,1301.52,"Well, a -- a couple of responses to that, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.28,1319.24,"Some of us, but --"
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1319.24,1320.64,-- we know that our vote will come out one way or another.
2017.16-1161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1320.64,1341.68,"In Wisconsin, before this plan, was it the case that when it was something like 49 out of 99 districts were uncontested, nobody -- the election was -- wasn't contested because the one party or the other was going to win."
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1341.68,1346.96,"Well, I -- I don't think you can quite draw that conclusion from the fact there's uncontested races."
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.12,1386.84,"I have to say that I don't think you ever answered the question: If the state has a law or a constitutional amendment that's saying all legitimate factors must be used in a way to favor party X or party Y, is that lawful?"
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1386.84,1402.4,"I think it's -- on the face of the Constitution as a requirement the district must -- the legislature must comply with, then that could be your instance of a -- a problem that can be actually solved by the Constitution, but it's quite different to me when you have a facially neutral districting matter --"
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.4,1405.92,Is that an equal protection violation or a First Amendment violation?
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1405.92,1415.72,"Well, it's a little hard to say at this point because, you know, it really just hasn't been fully explored, this concept of how you would come at all of this from a First Amendment perspective."
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.24,1420.24,"Well, you said there's a Constitution -- is it equal protection?"
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1420.24,1425.0,"I think the question -- I mean, it would be who has standing to bring their --"
2017.16-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1425.0,1426.4,"Well, assume standing."
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1429.24,1430.4,Yes.
2017.16-1161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1452.2,1465.2,Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering? How -- how does that help our system of government?
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1465.2,1465.44,Sure.
2017.16-1161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1466.16,1485.28,"You -- you almost concede that it doesn't when you say if a state filed -- has a constitutional amendment or has a law that says you must comply with traditional criteria, but you must also politically gerrymander, you're saying that might be unconstitutional?"
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1485.28,1507.56,"It might be, but I don't think that necessarily means that districting for partisan advantage has no positive values. I would point you to, for instance, Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion in Vieth which has an extensive discussion of how it can actually do good things for our system to have districts drawn in a way that makes it easier for voters to understand who they are account -- who the legislature is."
2017.16-1161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1514.48,1537.36,"I really don't understand how any of that -- what that means. I mean, it -- it's okay to stack the decks so that for 10 years or an indefinite period of time one party, even though it gets a minority of votes, can't get a minor -- gets a minority of votes, can get the majority of seats?"
2017.16-1161,1,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1537.36,1541.56,"With all due respect, you know, I would certainly dispute the premise that the decks are stacked here."
2017.16-1161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.44,1561.92,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Smith."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1561.92,1588.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What the state is asking for here is a free pass to continue using an assembly map that is so extreme that it effectively nullifies democracy. As this case illustrates, it's now possible even in a 50/50 state like Wisconsin to draw a district map that is so reliably and extremely biased that it effectively decides in advance who's going to control the legislative body for the entire decade."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.4,1627.36,"Maybe we can just talk briefly about the standing issue. It is a little arresting to have a rule that we establish that when your claim is racial gerrymandering, it has to be limited to your district, you can't complain about racial gerrymandering elsewhere in the state, but here, if the claim is going to be political gerrymandering, you can raise claims about whole statewide issues even if there is no argument that you're gerrymandered, like the first plaintiff who votes in Madison, his vote isn't diluted in any way, and yet he is able to complain about voting anywhere in the state."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1627.36,1641.76,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that standing has to follow from the nature of the injury and that follows from the nature of the constitutional violation. A racial gerrymandering claim, a Shaw v. Reno claim, is an attack on a particular district for being drawn with excessive focus on race."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1657.68,1659.6,I don't understand --
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.6,1679.52,"What about -- what about the sign hypothetical? You know, you're up in far north of Wisconsin and somebody is -- is taking down the signs for the one candidate in the far south. That affects that individual's -- the strength of his vote for the state-wide purposes."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1681.76,1695.4,"Well, Your Honor, I think you could decide that while it might have some de minimis effect on the interest of any Democrat attempting to carry out that group's political agenda, that it's sufficiently de minimis that you wouldn't want to give standing to people outside the directly affected area."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1695.4,1698.64,Why -- why is it de minimis? It seems to me it's exactly the same thing.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1719.28,1728.96,"Well, Your Honor, if you had a systematic effort in a lot of places by members of one party to prevent the other party from campaigning effectively, I think that anybody in the Democratic Party in the state would have standing."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1728.96,1729.6,All right.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1763.84,1782.76,"Well, Your Honor, that's a Section 2 vote dilution claim, and I think that the law appropriately limits standing in that situation to people who live in the region of the state where there's an absence of an additional minority district. You wouldn't want to assume that some African American from a different part of the state has a collective interest with people over here in this part of the state just because of race."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.08,1792.44,"Well, but that's equally stereotyping."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1810.44,1810.64,Maybe they do --
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.64,1818.56,I don't think it's any more -- any less stereotypical to say that people are going to vote for parties because they support everything the party does statewide.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1818.56,1821.84,"Well, but to have standing, I think you'd want to find plaintiffs who do that, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1879.36,1879.76,Mr. Smith.
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.76,1885.36,"Mr. Smith -- do you have standing? Well, Justice Kagan?"
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1885.36,1898.72,"In a one-person one-vote case, does one person in an overpopulated district have standing to challenge not only that district, those district lines, but the entire state map?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1898.72,1899.44,That is true.
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1902.32,1906.2,"And why is that, and does it -- is it an analogy to this case?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1906.2,1907.72,"Well, it's certainly a helpful analogy."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.16,1947.8,"Mr. Smith, I'm going to follow an example of one of my colleagues and lay out for you as concisely as I can what -- what is the main problem for me and give you an opportunity to address it. I would think if these -- if the claim is allowed to proceed, there will naturally be a lot of these claims raised around the country."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2024.56,2024.84,Your Honor --
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.84,2032.72,"It is just not, it seems, a palatable answer to say the ruling was based on the fact that EG was greater than 7 percent."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2036.36,2042.0,"Your Honor, first thing I would say in response to that is that those challenges are already being brought."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2119.04,2119.88,"Well, Mr. Smith --"
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2119.88,2135.2,"No, but you're going to take these -- the whole point is you're taking these issues away from democracy and you're throwing them into the courts pursuant to, and it may be simply my educational background, but I can only describe as sociological gobbledygook."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2135.2,2137.52,"Your Honor, this is -- this is not complicated."
2017.16-1161,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.56,2147.6,"Can you say this? Look, don't agree with me just because it sounds favorable, because he won't in two minutes."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.24,2183.92,"And if you need a convenient label for that approach, you can call it proportional representation, which has never been accepted as a political principle in the history of this country."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2183.92,2187.32,"Your Honor, we are not arguing for proportional representation."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2197.68,2200.56,That sounds exactly like proportional representation to me.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2200.56,2206.44,Proportional representation is when you give the same percentage of seats as they have in percentage of votes.
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.2,2238.44,"Mr. Smith, can I just say something -- ask you a question about the political science? I mean, I -- gerrymandering is distasteful."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2397.76,2399.68,And there are all of these questions.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2405.52,2406.76,"Is there a question there, Your Honor?"
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.76,2408.48,"Yeah, there is a question there."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2410.36,2413.52,"I would say this if I might, Justice Alito."
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2491.0,2492.56,"Mr. Smith, may I -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2492.88,2494.68,"Please go ahead, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2494.68,2503.28,I -- I think that this symmetry idea is both an intuitive and an attractive principle.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2541.36,2541.84,"Well, the --"
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2541.84,2546.92,Because this -- this -- it seems to me that this map goes over pretty much every line you can name.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2546.92,2547.68,That's true.
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2547.68,2551.28,But where do you draw the line in another case and another case?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2551.28,2569.04,"Well, Justice Kagan, the great virtue of these three different measures, none of which were presented to the Court in Vieth when I argued the Vieth case -- and I didn't do a very good job -- is that they each allow you to assign a number to each gerrymander and that allows you to compare them across the country and back in history."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.24,2619.52,"All of those predictions -- I mean, Bandemer predicted the Democrats would never be able to attain a majority."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2638.88,2669.6,"The technique of sensitivity testing, which was done by the Defendants' expert in the -- in the process of drawing the map to make sure that they were drawing a permanent, non-flippable gerrymander, and then done again by the experts for the Plaintiffs in this case in court and tested by the court, is a -- a method by which you identify one thing about the map: Does it have a lot of swing districts in it, a lot of competitive districts in it? Because if it does, you can have a map that looks very biased in one year when all those districts go one way, but it might flip over."
2017.16-1161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2697.68,2698.48,"Mr. Smith, I'm --"
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2698.48,2710.48,"So are you suggesting that we should be looking for outliers or are you suggesting that we should be trying to filter out all manner of partisan consideration, or is it someplace in between?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2710.48,2733.6,"Your Honor, the word ""outlier"" is probably an appropriate one. Certainly, we don't think -- and we've followed the lead of this Court in Justice Kennedy's concurrence and other decisions of this Court -- that all partisanship is unconstitutional. What you need is a method by which the extreme gerrymander, the one that is fundamentally anti-democratic and is going to last for the full decade, can be identified and -- and held unconstitutional."
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2735.76,2744.08,"So, Mr. Smith, what is the formula that achieves that? Because the court below didn't rely on efficiency gap entirely."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2774.56,2782.36,"Well, Your Honor, the first thing I want to make clear is -- is that symmetry is what's being measured by the efficiency gap, by the other two tests that I mentioned."
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2783.84,2786.08,"Well, but there are different tests for measuring symmetry --"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2786.08,2786.32,Right.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2786.32,2786.6,-- right?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2786.6,2786.8,Right.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2786.84,2788.72,There is the test you previously proposed.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2795.32,2795.52,Right.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2795.52,2797.04,-- and we're not telling you how much of each.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2797.28,2798.24,"Well, I think it's fair --"
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2798.24,2805.32,"-- so that doesn't seem very fair to the states to me, to -- to -- to know how to -- what they're supposed to do to avoid the kind of litigation we're talking about."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2812.92,2813.84,Not true.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2814.2,2815.04,"Now, that's what the other side says."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2819.08,2825.4,"Well, first of all, I -- I would go with the -- the screens that Justice Breyer mentioned, the first one being it has to be a one-party state."
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2844.88,2847.08,How? I am still stuck on Justice Breyer's question.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2847.08,2850.28,You can use the -- you can use any of those three tests that were all applied here.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2850.28,2850.72,Any of them?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2850.72,2851.04,Yes.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2851.04,2851.56,Any -- any of the three?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2851.56,2853.88,"And if they don't -- I -- I would suggest you apply all of them, and --"
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2853.88,2854.0,All of them?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2854.0,2860.32,"-- if they disagree, that would -- that would tell you maybe this isn't the right case to be holding something unconstitutional."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2863.16,2863.48,Excuse me.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2864.12,2866.16,-- the line -- I'm sorry.
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2866.16,2890.28,"Just on that, isn't it true that you could -- you can get very high levels of -- very high EG based on factors that have nothing to do with gerrymandering? The -- the political geography can lead to it; protection of incumbents, which has been said to be a legitimate factor, can lead to a high EG; compliance with the Voting Rights Act can affect that?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2890.28,2907.92,"Certainly, there are various factors that -- that -- other than partisan bias that can lead you to draw a map that does not have a zero EG. In our test, with the intents requirement, the effects requirement, and the justification requirement, all of those problems are taken care of either at the intent stage or at the justification stage."
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2907.92,2925.52,"How are they taken care of at the justification stage? The proposal is to run many -- you know, millions of -- of alternative maps to see whether using some traditional districting requirements, you can produce a map that has a lower -- a lower EG."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2944.44,2981.4,"Actually, they do -- they do take into account the Voting Rights Act. The Chen study that was discussed in one of the amicus briefs and is discussed somewhat in the merits briefs here, where they -- he produced 200 randomly generated maps of Wisconsin using all the state's traditional criteria, he started with the minority districts that were already drawn by the state in Act 43 and kept those in place. And so then he generated -- randomly generated maps, and he found that the degree of bias created by the political geography in Wisconsin is minute, modest, a little bit, something -- just like what the District Court found, maybe 1 or 2 percent, not even remotely like what they have in the map."
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2981.64,2992.36,"Would it be fair to require plaintiffs to provide those maps, many, many of them, so that one can tell whether the actual map is an outlier?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2992.36,2999.6,"Well, I think in -- in the cases going forward after this -- these technologies are there, they will be in the record in almost every case."
2017.16-1161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3046.4,3053.52,"So, for an example, that becomes a way to filter out the effects of geography from the effects of partisan advantage?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3053.52,3054.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3121.56,3150.04,"Mr. Smith, will you clarify what you mean by one-party state? Here, we know that the maps were drawn by the Republicans and every -- everybody else was excluded, even some Republicans were excluded. But suppose the legislature has a Republican majority, but there are Democrats, say it's 60/40, 40 percent Democrat, and the redistricting is done by the legislature."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3157.6,3158.32,"I do, Your Honor."
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3171.64,3175.04,"Mr. Smith, is that a -- is that a republican form of government claim?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3175.04,3182.6,I think it's a First Amendment claim and an equal protection claim. I -- I'm not going to try to revive the republican form of government clause at this late stage of --
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3182.6,3186.36,"Isn't that -- isn't that exactly what you're trying to do, though?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3186.36,3186.4,No.
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3186.4,3196.4,"You're saying it's a one-party rule and that would violate a republican form of government guarantee. Wouldn't that be the more specific constitutional provision to look to, rather than the generic equal protection clause?"
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3196.4,3196.6,"Well, I --"
2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3196.6,3216.2,"For that matter, maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter, the Constitution. And where exactly do we get authority to revise state legislative lines? When -- when the Constitution authorizes the federal government to step in on state -- state legislative matters, it's pretty clear."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3239.88,3249.36,"Well, I don't think there's anything unusual about using the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to regulate the abusive management of state elections by state government."
2017.16-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.24,3251.88,Where did one-person/one-vote come from?

2017.16-1161,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3291.24,3293.8,Do you see any impediment to Congress acting in this this area?
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3293.8,3297.08,Other than the fact that politicians are never going to fix gerrymandering.
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3299.16,3302.52,"This is -- the problem in this area is if you don't do it, it's locked up."

So he was wrong in that."
2017.16-1161,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3354.0,3362.36,"Your Honor, I'd have to see what that sentence is saying in context. I'm quite confident Mr. McGhee does not think that redistricting is not a -- is a non-problem or that --"
2017.16-1161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3362.36,3363.24,"Well, that's what he said."
