1990.89-1448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1448, Virginia Bankshares v. Doris I. Sandberg."
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,9.606,16.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.288,214.922,"Well, in the Mills case--"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,214.922,215.338,--a vote which was never in doubt.
1990.89-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.338,224.561,"--In the Mills case, counsel, we said that causation would be shown, didn't we, if the defect had a significant propensity to mislead?"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,224.561,233.868,"Yes, Your Honor, and of course the Court left open the question of whether causation could be shown in a situation where the minority shareholders had no voting power."
1990.89-1448,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.82,241.605,Leaving it open sort of indicated it might be a moot question.
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,242.807,250.628,"Arguable at least, but I... now that the SEC, I believe, has sided with us on this proposition, I... as I understand my brother's arguments, they--"
1990.89-1448,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.628,253.247,"But they have never decided it in an adjudication, have they?"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,253.247,254.28,--That is correct.
1990.89-1448,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.28,258.817,So this might just be appellate counsel's view of it?
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,258.817,262.686,"This may be appellate counsel's view of it, that's correct."
1990.89-1448,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.686,263.305,But still right?
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,263.305,264.121,But still correct.
1990.89-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,285.884,287.503,Were those theories argued to the jury?
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,287.503,291.888,"Those theories were not argued to the jury, Your Honor, and that's a critical point."
1990.89-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.28,316.605,"Mr. Shapiro, I didn't understand... I didn't understand the SEC to have taken the position in this case that there can't possibly be the requisite causality if the votes of the minority shareholders are not needed."
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,330.68,331.782,"Your Honor, you're correct."
1990.89-1448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.5,391.403,"Mr. Shapiro, how do you think a proper instruction on causation should read?"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,391.403,404.878,"A proper instruction, Your Honor, would direct the jury to consider the issue of proximate cause and cause in fact without telling the jury that causation is established simply because there is an essential link."
1990.89-1448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.984,439.718,"Well, now, does the Government, the Solicitor General, take the position of... that something... that for instance, if the practicalities are such that the company wants to get a favorable vote from the stockholders, whether or not they have the power to stop it, that that could be causation?"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,439.718,440.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.026,457.846,Of if for some reason the shareholders' rights under State law would be affected.
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,457.846,460.232,That is the position that they have taken.
1990.89-1448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.898,462.0,And do you disagree with that?
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,462.0,467.571,"Well, we think that those issues need not be reached here, because causation wasn't decided--"
1990.89-1448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.571,468.62,"Well, do you disagree with that?"
1990.89-1448,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,471.622,472.389,--Of course.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1565.804,1572.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.689,1701.176,But prior to that time didn't they move for summary judgment on the ground that there was no essential link?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1701.176,1703.326,"--Well, Your Honor, both... there are two--"
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.326,1704.628,Can't you answer that yes or no?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1704.628,1708.347,"--I believe no, Your Honor, and let me explain why."
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.914,1738.283,Was it a brief on a question... on a motion for summary judgment?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1738.283,1739.033,"Yes it was, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.126,1755.328,Did they raise this issue in the court of appeals?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1755.328,1756.311,"No, Your Honor, they didn't."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.885,1771.939,So you think below they conceded this was an essential link?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1771.939,1782.478,"--I think, Your Honor, that they conceded that the correct instructions on which the case was to be submitted to the jury was that the test was essential link."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.664,1793.02,"Counsel, you referred us to their proposed jury charge on the second element, namely reliance materiality."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1817.885,1824.122,"Well, Your Honor, that is exactly the instruction that Judge Bryan gave, and it appears at page 424 of the joint appendix."
1990.89-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.122,1838.799,"Well, but the petitioners say that what he gave in the proximate cause instruction he later took away by saying that I instruct you that in this case it is sufficient if it was an essential link."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1848.606,1861.664,"Well, Your Honor, I think the other instruction to which you refer, which is at 426, is one that begins with it is not necessary for plaintiff to establish a separate showing of reliance if she shows it's an essential link."
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.026,1911.18,"We have shifted a little bit, haven't we, Mr. Hassett?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1917.001,1922.286,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the two concepts of course get murkily involved with each other."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.792,1961.863,But did they... did the court leave it to the jury to decide whether... the essential link question?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1961.863,1972.135,"He instructed them in the instruction at 426, Your Honor, that if they found it was necessary to solicit proxies from minority stockholders, they may find that it was an essential link."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.135,1976.253,"Well, how did... and did he tell them that it was or wasn't necessary to solicit?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1976.253,1977.622,"No, he did not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.622,1980.907,"Well, what evidence... how would the jury know whether it was necessary or not?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1980.907,1984.609,"Well, the evidence... there was evidence in two regards before the jury, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.083,1997.633,Yes.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,1997.633,2004.253,And petitioners themselves asked the jury to find that approval of the merger by the minority stockholders--
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.253,2004.772,What was the other reason?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2004.772,2041.279,"--The other reason was that there was evidence that the holding company had decided and had represented to the bank that in order to avoid the adverse consequences of forcing this down upon the minority stockholders against their will, that... and the testimony was, I think at page 202 of the joint appendix, the chairman of the bank testified that the representation was made to him by the holding company that before this could happen, this acquisition of the minority stock by the holding company, the board of the bank would have to approve it, and the chairman of the bank testified that we would have to go to the stockholders for their approval as well."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.335,2057.038,Is it your position that the solicitation was required by Virginia law?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2057.038,2058.322,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.322,2062.44,"And so you don't claim that if it was that would be, prove the essential link?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2062.44,2063.324,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.985,2090.96,"So if the jury found for you and they had to find there was an essential link, the only evidence that there was relating to the essential link was the evidence that you just mentioned?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2090.96,2094.246,"--That I summarized, and it is set out in a little more detail in the brief."
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.329,2102.5,"Mr. Hassett, now I know you have explained this already, but it's not clear to me."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2129.252,2136.823,"I think, Your Honor, does it go on and say you must find it's a material misstatement, and that the solicitation was an essential link?"
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2136.823,2137.739,Was an essential link.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2139.791,2140.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2140.741,2147.964,"Now, the Solicitor General takes the position that that's not enough, that that's improper."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2152.999,2154.368,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2158.736,2160.855,But on this point they are not so brilliant?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2160.855,2176.615,"As to this... well, as to this, Your Honor, actually what I think is that because of the peculiar way that this case developed, where none of these arguments were made in the district court, and it is undeniable that there was... that petitioners, who were the appellants in the court of appeals, said nothing about it in their briefs in the court of appeals--"
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.615,2191.79,"Well, but they did argue below that the instruction of causation that was given on page 424 was appropriate, that that was the causation instruction that ought to be given."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2191.79,2197.361,"--The petitioners, Your Honor... there is three paragraphs... there's two different instructions at 424."
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2210.686,2225.095,"Was an objection made to this instruction on page 426 about the essential link, the one that takes away the causation instruction?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2225.095,2231.415,"--The... there's two... on page 426, the way that--"
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.415,2233.534,In the middle of the page.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2233.534,2233.951,--Yes.
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.486,2235.953,Yes.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2235.953,2239.455,"--The next two paragraphs, Your Honor, were one instruction."
1990.89-1448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2242.223,2242.889,Yes.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2242.889,2244.973,The directors did not object to 29.
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.066,2272.723,"How about, at the risk of repetition but this seems to be fairly critical, this last sentence on page 426 in the paragraph where it says"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2289.501,2300.191,"Yes, Your Honor, provided that in the next... you have to read it in conjunction, we submit, Your Honor, with the next paragraph, which defines essential link."
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.428,2312.633,And... but... and you say there was no objection by the... or there was objection by Bankshares to the thing I just read?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2312.633,2315.152,"There was by Bankshares, Your Honor, but not to the directors."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.018,2347.104,Do you agree with that paragraph about essential link?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2362.383,2363.899,"Your Honor, the evidence--"
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.899,2365.083,You mean as a matter of law?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2365.083,2365.668,--No.
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.178,2382.344,"All right, so--"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2382.344,2389.081,"--Our view, Your Honor, was that it was necessary to solicit from minority stockholders because it was necessary to obtain their votes."
1990.89-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.113,2414.565,--You argued that to the jury?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2414.565,2423.671,"No, Your Honor, there was no... there was no argument... there was no evidence by the other side that questioned the necessity of soliciting them to get this approval."
1990.89-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2425.707,2427.74,Did you put in evidence that it was necessary?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2427.74,2435.312,"--Yes, Your Honor, because we proved that there was a conflict of interest, which they admitted before the jury."
1990.89-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.847,2441.549,Was the jury advised that this is why you were putting that evidence in?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2441.549,2442.599,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.947,2504.457,"Mr. Hassett, that's... surely it's a question of law and not of fact whether the only way that this conflict of interest could be cured under Virginia law is to get the approval of the minority shareholders."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2512.644,2520.967,"--But Your Honor, the question, I think there are underlying facts, of course, that have to be found to present that question of law."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.967,2522.835,Like what?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2533.407,2546.117,"Well, I think that there's another fact there which is was the board so much of a rubber stamp, as the court of appeals held it was on another aspect of the case not submitted, but that the board couldn't cure the conflict."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.108,2567.03,"And the jury was instructed the board could have cured it, but if you find the jury... the board was a rubber stamp, it couldn't?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2567.03,2569.263,"--No, there was no instruction to that effect, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.053,2584.04,Let's assume they had objected to this instruction on the definition of the essential link.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2599.752,2600.652,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.652,2602.204,Isn't that what their position is?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2602.204,2602.754,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.754,2604.387,"And that, you certainly disagree with that?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2604.387,2606.47,"I do agree with that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.47,2614.493,And your answer is that that position was never pressed or objected to in the district court or in the court of appeals?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2614.493,2616.278,"That is absolutely our position, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.348,2638.024,"So we could decide this case for you by just saying that the issue that the petitioners want decided is... we just don't decide it, because it wasn't pressed below, and so we don't decide it."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2638.024,2639.274,--That's exactly right.
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.274,2639.674,We leave it open.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2639.674,2641.226,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.261,2646.713,So we don't... no necessity to reject the SEC's position?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2646.713,2647.713,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.713,2650.831,"Well, now wait, but that wouldn't dispose of the case."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2664.758,2665.441,"Oh, we do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.991,2668.292,You say that that is not preserved either?
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2668.292,2669.226,"--That is right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.226,2670.411,I didn't understand that.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2670.411,2672.844,The directors made no such motion of any kind.
1990.89-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.184,2685.421,"I am puzzled about this notion that just some of them made the objection, because aren't they all parties here?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2686.554,2688.04,"Oh, yes, they are, Your Honor, but under--"
1990.89-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.04,2688.89,"Well, then the question's here, isn't it?"
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2693.525,2702.198,"--Well, except, Your Honor, that if the directors, for example, are barred from raising it, then the judgment should be affirmed as to them."
1990.89-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.198,2702.764,As to them.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2708.118,2711.303,At that stage I would say as to Bankshares it would be moot.
1990.89-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.303,2718.492,"It doesn't make a great deal of difference to us whether we're deciding as to one petitioner or both, if we have to decide the question."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2718.492,2721.861,I would suggest it is moot if it's not preserved by the directors.
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.633,2733.1,"Well, we don't encourage a finding of mootness."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2738.787,2741.923,"--I understand that, Your Honor, but may I say on behalf of--"
1990.89-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.923,2752.13,"Your argument really is we should dismiss it as improvidently granted, because the issue we want to decide... the SEC wants us to decide and the petitioners want to decide, just isn't before us."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2752.13,2753.13,"--Well, that is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.748,2761.7,Your time... you're using the SEC's time.
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2763.236,2776.543,"--I'll just say very quickly, Your Honor, that the position taken by the SEC was something that they briefed before they saw the brief of the petitioners, and I think that the SEC was saying that the instruction is faulty because--"
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2776.543,2779.863,"Well, maybe the SEC would be the best person to say that."
1990.89-1448,1,30985,joseph_m_hassett,,2779.863,2780.663,"--Let me just... yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.663,2781.28,Thank you.
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2783.832,2790.386,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.852,2821.524,"Mr. Dreeben, I mean, I know you want to talk about the misleading part, but do you have a view on the causation issue as to whether all that is properly reserved for our review or not?"
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2821.524,2828.594,"Justice Stevens, neither the SEC nor the FDIC has taken a position on the waiver issue in this case."
1990.89-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.39,2851.21,So you really don't take a position on the ultimate question of what we should do with this judgment?
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2851.21,2852.626,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.731,2871.671,"You have to take the position of do not take a position, because you really did say in your brief accordingly, the judgment, to the extent that it depends on the validity of those instructions, cannot stand."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2871.671,2873.373,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.61,2881.129,"Oh, I see."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2881.479,2882.379,We take that position.
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.931,2885.414,"Nice, Mr. Dreeben."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2894.037,2912.264,"--Justice O'Connor, we think that the causation instruction in a case when shareholders occupy a minority position should spell out in some more detail than here what the causal theory is as to why the misleading proxy statement caused the injury."
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.428,2985.295,"Mr. Dreeben, you say it wasn't presented to the jury."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2992.533,2995.735,"--There was evidence induced in the record, Justice White."
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.735,3000.187,"And if the jury had to find that that was necessary, they must have relied on that evidence."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3000.187,3005.507,It isn't precisely clear from the record--
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.507,3008.459,"Well, there was some evidence about other theories of causation, wasn't there?"
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3008.459,3012.261,--I think there was evidence presented as to--
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.261,3013.863,"Well, like the conflict of interest."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3013.863,3018.315,--There was evidence presented as to the conflict of interest because the petitioners--
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.315,3023.469,"Well, and the jury followed their instructions... we assume they did... and found that the solicitation was necessary."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3030.889,3036.876,--The conflict of interest was injected into the case because there was a separate breach of fiduciary duty--
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.876,3043.632,"Well, what evidence do you suppose the jury relies on to find... in this record, to find that the solicitation was necessary?"
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3043.632,3053.154,"--I'm not sure, Justice White, but there was a concession made by the plaintiff... by the defendants' attorneys during the trial that it was necessary to solicit proxies."
1990.89-1448,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.808,3068.164,"Well, I know, but the instruction was that the jury itself had to find based on the evidence."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3074.402,3080.488,"Justice White, I can't say whether it functioned as a stipulation in this case or whether there was other evidence."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.51,3121.362,"Before you do that... I know you have been trying to get there, but also of importance to the Government and to private actions is whether there is a private right of action under 14(a) for any effect, any causality, unless it pertains to the vote for which the proxy was solicited, 14(a) having been adopted when the... in an era when the Court was much more ready to find implied rights of action, and later cases cutting back on that readiness."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3148.013,3158.07,"--Well, I think there are several reasons, Justice Scalia, why interpreting the causation element of this recognized cause of action to cover cases like this one is appropriate."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.795,3174.68,"He could have a cause of action under State law for misrepresentation, I assume."
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.68,3184.055,"Well, but this is an express Federal provision under rules promulgated by the SEC and by other agencies that prohibits false and misleading proxy statements."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.055,3186.038,In order to protect voting rights.
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3186.038,3192.91,"I think more generally, Justice Scalia, to protect the State-created processes that function in the corporate governance context."
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.269,3214.221,And if they voted for the merger they couldn't... they didn't... couldn't have an appraisal.
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3214.221,3214.887,That's correct.
1990.89-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.182,3252.394,"I suppose, but if I think the private right of action shouldn't have been created in the first place, is there anything that would be illogical in my saying that it, having been created, we should narrow it to... it having been wrongly created, without overruling prior decisions, we should narrow it simply to voting rights?"
1990.89-1448,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3252.394,3259.5,"--Well, yes, I think it would be inconsistent with the right of action that was recognized itself, which required an element of causation."
1990.89-1448,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.841,3355.791,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3358.876,3360.209,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1448,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3360.209,3386.776,"Mr. Shapiro, I must say that I am troubled by the argument that the instruction that was submitted by the defendants at page 91 of the joint appendix seems to track very closely what the district court in fact instructed, and your... the submitted instructions break causality and materiality up the same way."
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3389.395,3392.513,A similar instruction was submitted by the other group of defendants.
1990.89-1448,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.092,3417.379,You didn't object to that essential link instruction on page 426.
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3417.379,3418.331,--We did indeed.
1990.89-1448,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.77,3428.27,"To that specific instruction, that specific paragraph?"
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3428.27,3428.986,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3431.888,3434.257,"Where is that in the record, Mr. Shapiro?"
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3434.257,3446.065,"--This is cited on page 9 of, excuse me, page 3 of our reply brief, the yellow reply brief at the top, where we cite to the places where we objected to that instruction."
1990.89-1448,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.799,3473.415,Did you press this in the court of appeals?
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3473.415,3474.584,"We did indeed, Your Honor."
1990.89-1448,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.584,3475.801,You did or didn't?
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3475.801,3476.267,We did.
1990.89-1448,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.952,3481.118,I suppose we could get your briefs and read what you said?
1990.89-1448,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3481.118,3481.685,Absolutely.
1990.89-1448,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.203,3595.253,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
