1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,25.141,29.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,506.745,509.564,As a matter of construction of the re -- regulation?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,509.564,512.714,The Court was not entirely clear.
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,570.763,572.978,Was that done to sue his party?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,572.978,573.489,I beg your pardon.
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,573.489,575.345,Was that done to sue his party?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,575.345,597.306,"Well, under a -- under a provision of the Texas Civil Code, the Supreme Court may summarily reverse or summarily enter an order on an application for writ of error, where the case is squarely inconsistent with another case which is the Court has decided."
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1004.893,1009.036,Is this case -- this issue come up in the lower federal court?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1009.036,1019.156,It has not come up in any case in the lower federal courts that I know of except the couple of tax cases in which -- which are quite distinguishable; they are I think cited in our brief.
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1068.56,1069.427,Mr. Claytor.
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1069.427,1069.773,"Yes, sir."
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1069.773,1075.093,Does the minority view fasten on the word recognized in 315.61?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1075.093,1082.085,"In most of the discussion, they -- they don't quite pass the language that specifically."
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1113.042,1115.753,"That looked strongly in that, the word recognize is (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1115.753,1116.803,The word recognize --
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1116.803,1117.399,-- (Voice Overlap) --
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1117.399,1130.505,"-- is a basis, it is a -- it is a -- let me say that if we were dealing with this a priori, one could certainly make the argument that the word recognize permits a different interpretation."
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1144.812,1147.357,It's been continuity of administrative interpretation.
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1147.357,1148.922,Yes.
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1192.105,1193.816,That really takes the question.
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1193.816,1195.985,I think it's in a -- in a sense it does.
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1251.574,1254.365,But the property doctrine in Texas --
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1254.365,1257.781,That property doctrine in Texas and it didn't make any difference.
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1341.857,1348.418,That all against putting to one side of the doctrine of the law of res judicata in Texas.
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1357.47,1359.829,It is not necessarily foreclosed.
1961.205,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1431.468,1440.233,"Well, that would re -- that would require us to go into what Texas law is as to the scope of the managerial authority of the husband."
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1440.233,1445.669,"I think that would have a bearing, it would not necessarily be controlling but it would certainly have a bearing."
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1457.5,1463.248,Is there a tribal issue on -- is there a tribal issue as the issue of fact on this second question?
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1463.248,1464.619,"Oh yes, oh yes."
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1464.619,1469.482,"So this -- if this -- if you won this case, it would still -- that --"
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1469.482,1470.112,If it were held --
1961.205,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1470.112,1471.328,-- (Voice Overlap) -- back.
1961.205,0,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,1471.328,1491.49,"-- well, let me recite, If the appellate courts, the Court and the Texas Appellant Court hold that the issue raised by the allegation of the wife knowledge in consent would be controlling if she hadn't -- if the purchase was without her knowledge and consent then it would have to go for trial."
1961.205,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1533.786,1537.176,Mr. McWhirter.

1961.205,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1930.985,1937.713,"Well, they got to him the -- the bonds got back to Mr. Free with a lien on that."
1961.205,1,37507,olin_p_mcwhirter,,1937.713,1938.714,Not necessarily.
1961.205,2,44261,w_graham_claytor_jr,,2304.28,2305.171,Mr. Chief Justice --
