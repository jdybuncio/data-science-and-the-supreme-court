1994.94-329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.458,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-329, Ronald W. Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia."
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,11.57,14.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,60.031,61.212,What if they were Republicans?
1994.94-329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,61.212,62.591,That's just the question I was going to ask.
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,65.331,68.064,"Well, then I'll ask Democrats, just to make it--"
1994.94-329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,98.796,100.537,You have to help me a little more on this question.
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,108.332,112.954,"Your Honor, there are two relevant exclusions for political groups."
1994.94-329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,134.079,141.605,Would not the rule that you are arguing for entitle such a political group also to get funding?
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,141.605,153.85,"Your Honor, the guidelines expressly provide, and I refer to page 66... 65 to 66a of the appendix to the petition."
1994.94-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.751,210.688,"As I understand it, Mr. McConnell, there are two bases for exclusion of religious publications."
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,224.867,227.558,"That's right, Your Honor, and there's been no--"
1994.94-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.558,231.071,And the latter does not apply to the political exclusion.
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,242.199,243.861,--That's exactly correct.
1994.94-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.861,249.684,"Whereas for religions, if you are either a religious group or you exhibit religious belief, you're out."
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,249.684,254.387,"That's correct, and there's been no claim in this case that my clients are a religious organization."
1994.94-329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.387,265.246,"Mr. McConnell, the religious provision to which Justice Scalia refers is an activity which primarily promotes or manifests a political belief in and about a deity or an ultimate reality."
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,268.117,269.356,Exactly.
1994.94-329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.356,274.11,"Yes, I see, and the political one is an organization primarily involved, and so forth and so on."
1994.94-329,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,277.822,304.28,"The difference is the language that I was just reading a moment ago, which excludes from the definition of political activities the mere, 65a to 66a, very top of the page of 66a, are not intended to include funding, preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization which 3) espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1756.455,1762.679,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.538,1793.039,"But not based on viewpoint, I take it."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1794.381,1794.902,--I do.
1994.94-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.392,1800.974,So this boils down to whether this is a viewpoint case?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1800.974,1826.672,"--I do think that's exactly the heart of the question, and if I may just clear up one issue that was left over from the earlier colloquy, under the university's guidelines, the definition of political activity, which is defined to mean lobbying or electioneering, and the definition of religious activities are not exactly alike, but they raise precisely the same constitutional question."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.329,1870.771,"But as I understand, Mr.... I'm sorry."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.771,1893.986,"Mr. Jeffries, take a look at... on page 66a of the petition, the number 3 parenthetical in the carryover paragraph on page... where it's talking about political activity, and apparently excepted are student organizations which espouse particular positions or ideological viewpoints."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1898.11,1917.962,"The intent of the guidelines is to allow in the political area a wide variety of point of views, and to except two fairly narrow categories, electioneering, by which I mean publication devoted expressly to an election result, hence the Clinton campaign newsletter, and lobbying legislatures."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.962,1928.889,"Well then, suppose you have a newspaper that simply espouses the Republican point of view, or the Democratic point of view."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1938.866,1942.607,Liberal and conservative points of view are freely permitted.
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.709,1946.84,Yes.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1946.84,1955.496,--and the exclusion from funding would be those activities so closely allied with an election result as to be found to be electioneering.
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.496,1968.896,"So that some might say the Americans For Democratic Action, or something, a liberal group which consistently supports Democratic candidates but doesn't really electioneer for them, they could be funded?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,1968.896,1973.068,"Yes, sir, would be eligible for funding."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.068,2002.657,"Now, why is that different from a group that is not trying to recruit people to a particular Christian sect, but simply espousing the truthfulness of certain Christian doctrines, just as this other group, while not trying to get you to vote for a particular candidate, is espousing the truthfulness of that candidate's position on a lot of issues?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2003.628,2005.711,The guidelines make that distinction.
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.568,2049.929,I'm talking about different things.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2073.625,2076.706,--Why do the guidelines make the distinction they make?
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.706,2078.056,You acknowledge that they make that distinction.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2078.056,2078.958,The guidelines--
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.958,2085.433,"Now, you used to say the reason they make it is, the Establishment Clause made us do it, but you're not taking that position today, right?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2085.433,2093.378,"--Obviously, if the Establishment Clause forbids us from giving direct aid to religion, there is an end to the matter, but we do not stand on that ground."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.231,2115.183,"This is not a church, though."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2132.163,2140.699,"With respect, Justice Scalia, the plaintiffs were not denied eligibility as a religious organization."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.582,2145.083,Yes.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2145.083,2153.297,"They were denied funding because the publication of this magazine was found to be a religious activity, a conclusion that they have not... never contested."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.297,2158.49,"Because it manifests a particular belief in or about a deity, right?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2158.49,2163.032,"Because it primarily manifests a particular belief in or about a deity, yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2163.032,2167.546,But that is different from lobbying and campaigning.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2187.057,2197.346,"Well, in my judgment, Justice Kennedy, the cases on which the petitioners rely are quite consistently free speech cases."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.137,2221.192,"But the university can say that these are not educational activities, and draw the line there."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2233.499,2240.783,It may be misleading to think of the university's policy as refusing to fund a discussion of abstract views.
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.846,2264.46,"Well, do you take the position that any discussion of religious views is proselytizing?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2264.46,2265.371,"No, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.371,2270.373,"That's all your guidelines say, manifests a particular view."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2276.687,2279.949,That constitutes a religious activity.
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.155,2311.349,Is the giving of religious instruction a religious activity that calls... makes it outside the funding?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2311.349,2316.582,Our policy on that is exactly the policy reflected in the Religious Studies Department.
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.853,2342.622,"I mean, for example, if what... this magazine has articles in it that says Christianity and the five-legged stool, and then it says, for example, how you should lead a holy life, spread the Gospel, make social justice, follow the Holy Spirit, and pursue intellectual excellence, all of which are fine, but is that type of article the kind of article that falls outside funding, and why, precisely?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2342.622,2349.036,"--Funding decisions, Justice Breyer, are not made on the basis of articles or columns or particular essays."
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.036,2351.747,"No, but I mean, the character of the magazine."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2351.747,2352.396,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.396,2363.555,"If the magazine did not have such articles, but only said, we have a religious point of view involving certain social issues, certain educational issues."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2371.319,2373.67,The distinction--
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.67,2374.672,--in terms of this magazine.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2374.672,2377.634,"--On these facts, we think that distinction is clear."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.69,2390.183,I don't know what you mean by proselytizing.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2428.307,2431.688,Let me answer that question this way.
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.825,2440.613,Yes.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2440.613,2449.399,"--there are inevitably questions of degree, and there may well be close cases, and there may well be a line-drawing problem down the road."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2465.911,2474.397,"Mr. Jeffries, suppose that a student newspaper decides that regular columns are good for the newspaper."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2476.027,2476.607,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2476.607,2489.777,"And it said, we want good writers, and we want four regular columns, and they have a survey of the best writers, and one of them is a religious writer, a Christian writer, and that's all he writes about in the column."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2497.121,2499.725,We have not attempted to promulgate such a guideline.
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.725,2502.604,Can the university constitutionally do it under the First Amendment?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2502.604,2504.527,I doubt it.
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2504.527,2507.299,Why is this case any different?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2507.299,2517.357,"We have... the standard, as I see, under the decisions of this Court, is basically a standard of reasonableness."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.191,2563.695,"But isn't there a difference between when the university decides, you know, what kinds of subjects to teach, say, in its Department of Religion, where it's putting out its own message, and where the university says, we're going to fund all sorts of student activities, and we're going to disassociate ourselves from their message?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2563.695,2567.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, the university does not fund all sorts of student activities."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.371,2598.447,"But they aren't devoted to espousing something that might be called, the university's point of view, or the university's idea of what education should be."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2598.447,2599.7,That is entirely correct.
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.907,2633.723,"But according to a case like Widmar v. Vincent, where you're talking about student activities like this, you can't exclude religion."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2633.723,2641.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, Widmar makes explicit reference to the fact that it is not intended to apply to funds."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2641.027,2654.127,"So you say providing space, or facilities and lighting and so forth, in doing that the university can't discriminate, but if instead of that it decides to make cash payments, it can?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2654.127,2658.231,"That's exactly right, and the university does not discriminate in any way."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.583,2673.618,"Well, you could really help these people out and even the playing field by not distributing your student activity subsidies in cash, just provide printing presses for all these organizations."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2678.273,2692.151,"--Justice Stevens said in Widmar that if access were short, that is, if it needed to be rationed, that would warrant the university giving access on the basis of the content of speech."
1994.94-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2717.468,2727.173,"Well, what if the activity involves a controversial speaker and providing facilities to take care of that?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2734.93,2737.57,It has been practically so in our experience.
1994.94-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.57,2739.231,But it might not be.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2739.231,2754.382,"--Yes, ma'am, and I agree with Justice Stevens that if access needed to be limited either because of cost or because of a lack of physical space, that would present a very different case from what was presented in Widmar or what was presented in Lamb's Chapel."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.642,2762.229,"And you could say, because there's a shortage of space we're going to decide religious organizations are at the end of the line?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2762.229,2764.449,--If there were a shortage of space that would present a--
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.449,2766.339,That's what Widmar stands for?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2766.339,2767.471,--a very different question.
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.471,2771.783,You're relying on Justice Stevens' separate opinion in Widmar for that?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2771.783,2772.815,"For that point, I am."
1994.94-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2774.284,2784.872,"I mean, I would have thought the First Amendment would indicate that if you have to restrict access it ought to be on some neutral ground."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2789.694,2797.612,"And we do not restrict access, so to the extent that the concern is about access, these plaintiffs have no quarrel with us."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2881.946,2883.338,What about secular humanism?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2883.338,2887.499,A journal devoted to secular humanism?
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2887.499,2888.089,Yes.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2888.089,2894.524,"As far as I know from the name you've given it, that would be fine."
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.619,2913.655,"If secular humanism says, we take this position because all religion is rot, you wouldn't fund it."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2913.655,2922.661,"If it were primarily devoted to the all-religion-is-rot position, it would qualify as a religious activity under the guidelines and would not be funded."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.182,2938.092,"No, but you're picking out theology."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2953.283,2958.615,"Yes, we do exactly that, Justice Scalia, with respect, for example, to lobbying and electioneering."
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.497,2975.917,"Could the University of Missouri in Widmar have said, we're going to deny access to this religious group to these rooms, and we're also going to deny access to any antireligious group, but we're going to give it to everybody else?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2975.917,2991.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, my understanding of the Widmar and Lamb's Chapel line of cases, which say that so long as they have a surplus of rooms, so long as there is no need to ration access to them, so long as everyone can be accommodated, those exclusions--"
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.988,2995.989,"Well, did the Court opinion in Widmar stress those facts?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,2995.989,3002.053,"--No, sir, it did not, but you have to read Widmar and Regan at the same time."
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3032.744,3035.615,Could I go to a question peculiar to funds?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3062.313,3064.864,"Justice Souter, the university pays my salary."
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3093.944,3108.492,"In effect you're saying, any subject matter distinction can be made, and it doesn't matter at the point in time, or the point in the legislative process at which the Government says, this is my speech as distinct from, this is what I will pay for."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3108.492,3119.81,"Any distinction can be made, so long as it meets this Court's standard of being reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view."
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3119.81,3142.206,"Suppose that there's a magazine put out by hobbyists, or by fraternities, and the magazine has some articles devoted to how wonderful it is to live at theta beta whatever, or how to build model air planes, but several other articles have to do with issues on campus from the point of view of the fraternity, or issues on campus from the point of view of model airplane builders."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3144.857,3149.86,"Insofar as it's put out by fraternities, I feel confident--"
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3149.86,3151.95,There are a group of people who happen to belong--
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3158.455,3161.798,--It is eligible to be considered for funding.
1994.94-329,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3161.798,3194.899,"Mr. Jeffries, if we don't accept your distinction placing this closer to the Government choosing what subjects it wants discussed, and we do accept that it's Government facilitating speech of others, not its own choices, you... how would you address the establishment objection that you've assiduously stayed away from in your brief?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3219.955,3230.893,"We say the fact that this case involves scarce dollars is decisively important, and we rely very heavily on Regan, and also on Rust v Sullivan."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.836,3299.169,"--You think that's a major step, a major--"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3299.169,3299.447,"Oh, yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.447,3300.098,--additional step?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3300.098,3300.549,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.549,3306.281,The step between providing a classroom and providing the money to rent a classroom you think is really--
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3306.281,3307.092,The step--
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3307.092,3309.684,--a step off a cliff.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3309.684,3312.726,--Access to a budget is a major step.
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.726,3317.17,"But the classrooms are bought with budget money, certainly."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3317.17,3327.166,"Yes, sir, and they are, once they're there, virtually cost-free to allow two classes or three classes as opposed to one or two, virtually cost-free."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.227,3331.43,"Well, that may affect the fisc."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3352.811,3355.684,May I try to identify the consequences?
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.579,3386.604,"But of course the only justification for your using the word, religious activity, is because of the special way in which this regulation defines it."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3389.807,3394.83,--Different from--
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3394.83,3399.792,Religious activities and religious exercises.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3399.792,3405.956,"--Well, our definition of religious activity is stated in the guidelines that's been quoted to you."
1994.94-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3414.535,3419.647,"The only thing that's at issue here is religious speech, not religious exercise."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3419.647,3427.4,"Justice Kennedy, you're drawing a distinction that I do not clearly apprehend."
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3427.4,3445.783,"Well, if for example you have a person who does... a Republican and a Democrat and an Episcopal minister all give exactly the same speech about the homeless problem, one from a Republican point of view, one Democratic, and one says I'm a minister and I have my own experience."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3447.184,3447.815,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3447.815,3450.176,You fund the first two but not the third.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3450.176,3454.729,We would not be in a position of funding any speech by speech.
1994.94-329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3455.989,3458.991,They write it a news... they write it in a little magazine.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3458.991,3462.824,"--All those may be published, and they all may be published in a newspaper which publishes lots of points of view."
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3462.824,3497.557,"And isn't it the case that when you were using religious speech in this argument, and when Virginia is deciding what it means to fund, specifically when Virginia uses the word manifest, aren't you, in each instance, talking about speech which does not merely explain a point of view, but espouses it, speech which in effect recognize the difference between, this is a way of thinking, and speech which says, this ought to be your way of thinking."
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3502.641,3511.967,"Yes, sir, and as those guidelines are applied, they focus for the hallmarks of a religious activity on observances or proselytizing, which we do not wish to fund."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3511.967,3521.191,Was there a finding of proselytizing intent as the basis for the... I don't find that anywhere in the record.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3538.115,3539.344,The opening--
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3539.344,3540.666,Would that be accepted?
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3542.427,3547.131,"--It might be, depending on the facts more carefully defined."
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3548.811,3549.621,"Oh, but in theory, it would."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3550.4,3553.913,--You have to say yes if you're going to answer Justice Souter the way you did.
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3553.913,3560.037,--The only reason I haven't said yes is because I don't know enough about your hypothetical magazine to have a confident reaction to it.
1994.94-329,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3560.037,3566.943,"It may be tough to identify it as one or the other, but the distinction is a distinction that the university would honor, isn't it?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3566.943,3569.444,"And that is... yes, sir, exactly."
1994.94-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3569.444,3574.357,"And the university would... who wrote these regulations for the university, then?"
1994.94-329,1,31191,john_c_jeffries_jr,,3590.006,3594.531,I think the best answer I can give you is that the magazines in the record do manifest a religious belief.
1994.94-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3601.935,3603.475,"Thank you, Mr. Jeffries."
1994.94-329,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3606.329,3621.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd just like to conclude with a practical observation about the real impact of... on free speech of the Government's use of the power of the purse."
1994.94-329,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3653.899,3656.891,I don't think that's what your brother is saying.
1994.94-329,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3674.962,3682.298,"--Your Honor, if their viewpoint were secular, they're certainly entitled to write a magazine saying, this is our viewpoint, and you should share that viewpoint."
1994.94-329,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3700.18,3701.721,They like the word manifest.
