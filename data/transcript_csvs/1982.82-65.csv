1982.82-65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.417,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Brown against Thomson, Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,15.354,20.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.457,122.595,"Ms. Davidson, is this material which you are speaking of now in the record somewhere, or in the opinion of the District Court?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,122.595,126.202,"--Yes, Mr. Justice, most of this material is in the record."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,244.935,256.664,"Ms. Davidson, did you attack the apportionment scheme as a whole, or just as it applied to the one county?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,256.664,260.46,"Mr. Justice, we attacked it just as to the one county."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,260.46,262.99,Why not the whole plan?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,262.99,289.48,"Although there was an awareness that the whole plan was probably unconstitutional, we received a directive from our clients to attack only that portion of the reapportionment act which gave Niobrara County a representative, because it was a feeling that any consideration other than population was wrong and clearly an award had been made to this county based upon its status as a political subdivision."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.48,291.948,You don't think you've weakened your case by this tactic?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,291.948,297.134,I think certainly we may have done so in the district court level.
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.134,307.191,Did... why are you so concerned about the grant of a single representative to this one county?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,307.191,315.656,"I think, Mr. Justice, we go back to the fact again that the grant was given purely because of its status as a political subdivision."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,322.983,325.106,But you don't care about the rest of the state?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,325.106,326.075,--I can't say that.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,335.666,336.369,May I ask you--
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,336.369,339.024,--Maybe if I can give you some background that that would be instrumental.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.024,343.928,--Would you as part of that background tell us who your clients are and what their interest is in winning this lawsuit?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,343.928,345.552,"Yes, I surely will."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,380.584,384.661,In your state does the League... is it statewide in its organization?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,384.661,386.145,"Yes, it is."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.926,388.004,Now I come back to my question.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,393.752,397.921,"--Hopefully, I had explained that but if I may once again."
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.817,431.673,"Your clients have to reach a sort of a political compromise, I suppose, just the way the legislature does."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,431.673,432.673,"Yes, that is in fact true."
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,432.673,436.376,"But that political compromise is not binding on us, I hope?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,436.376,437.39,Pardon me?
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.39,442.357,"That political compromise is not binding on us, I hope?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,442.357,443.325,"No, sir, it is not."
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.325,445.168,Why is it here at all?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,445.168,446.527,"Pardon me, again?"
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.527,454.773,"If we decide, this will apply to the other counties or just one county?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,454.773,475.452,"I think, Mr. Justice, that your authority goes as far as you want it to go, and certainly my clients are not going to be unhappy if your decision reaches beyond the consideration of this one county."
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.452,481.028,But I'd be bound by the pleadings in the case?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,481.028,483.34,"I think not, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.748,524.588,I just don't understand how the League of Women Voters or any other private organization can limit this Court.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,524.588,526.167,They cannot.
1982.82-65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.635,531.461,I should have said tried to.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,531.461,536.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.612,589.002,"Could I... could I ask you, did you attack the alternative--"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,589.002,591.844,The 63 plan?
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.844,592.171,--No.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,605.259,606.15,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.15,609.571,Did you attack that part of it?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,609.571,611.335,"No, we did not, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.335,618.66,"Well what's the... suppose that this county is combined with the next county, or whichever county it's to be combined with."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,618.66,619.051,Yes.
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.051,624.472,What then would be the maximum deviation between the largest county and the smallest county?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,624.472,624.956,The overall--
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.956,626.517,Or the... the largest district and the smallest district.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,626.517,626.861,--Thank you.
1982.82-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.297,636.311,And that would be between what?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,636.311,649.789,"That would be the difference between the most over-represented county and the most under-represented county, which would be Washakie as being the most under-represented, and Sublette as being the most over-represented county."
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.086,899.313,"But there is... I suppose it's almost self-demonstrating that if Niobrara County is to have one member of the legislature, the alternative... an alternative plan that would both provide for a minimal deviation and that, would give Wyoming a two or three hundred member house of representatives."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,899.313,900.593,"Yes, that is true."
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,911.339,926.395,"Ms. Davidson, what practical harm do your various clients in the more populous counties of Wyoming suffer as a result of giving Niobrara a representative rather than half a representative."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,926.395,927.645,That's a very good question.
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.146,972.33,"But if it's statewide it really doesn't make a whole lot of difference what the people in Niobrara County do or their one out of 64 representatives do, does it?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,972.33,979.561,"If I understand you to say, what is the impact of an individual voter, statewide, it would not be very great."
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,982.873,985.045,Isn't that again the weakness of your case?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,985.045,986.308,--I think not.
1982.82-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,986.308,988.636,In attacking just the one county?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,988.636,1006.487,"I think it is not, because the Court in past instances have said that any time a vote cast in one part of a state is worth substantially less than a vote cast anywhere else in the state, then there must be some sort of tremendous vote dilution which has occurred."
1982.82-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.102,1086.909,Would anything in a court order directing the Wyoming legislature to follow the 63-member plan rather the 64-member plan and merge Niobrara with whatever the other county is.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1092.062,1105.276,That is true.
1982.82-65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.472,1129.392,"What about the State's constitution, does that have some part on the response you just gave?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1129.392,1135.7,"Yes, well, there are two considerations which our Wyoming State constitution asks us to look at."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.974,1159.472,May I ask you a hypothetical question?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1176.481,1178.355,"I think it would not, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.04,1183.947,It would take care of the voting disparity.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1194.022,1200.893,"But, Mr. Justice, you still are limiting who can be qualified to sit in that seat."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.112,1204.189,"But, you have no interest in that as I understand it."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1207.844,1217.824,"--We are also very concerned that the County of Niobrara receives a seat, and Niobrara would continue to receive a seat, as I understand your hypothetical."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.824,1225.915,"Well supposing all of... the whole legislature was elected at large, but they provided residence requirements just exactly as they have now."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1232.709,1239.05,I don't know that it would be unconstitutional given prior rulings of this Court.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.203,1259.604,"If you agree that may that would not be unconstitutional, it seems to me you must also agree that my first hypothetical would not be unconstitutional, because then the voting power as for the people who voted for the Niobrara legislator would be equally distributed throughout the state."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1259.604,1260.713,"--But, again--"
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.713,1262.198,"You wouldn't like it, I understand."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1263.243,1263.712,--Sure.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.712,1267.758,But your claim must be founded on the constitution in order to prevail here.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1267.758,1277.349,"But, again, you would have a very small group of people, the citizens of Niobrara, who would be receiving one representative."
1982.82-65,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1282.408,1294.356,"Ms. Davidson, this type of plan has been in existence since 1913, as i recall, has I not?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1294.356,1306.071,"I believe a more accurate statement might be, Mr. Justice, that Niobrara County has received a representative since the county's creation in 1913."
1982.82-65,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1306.071,1307.069,Since what?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1307.069,1310.162,Since the County's creation in 1913.
1982.82-65,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1310.162,1310.459,Yes.
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1316.128,1323.906,"Yes, but there were different factors to be considered at that point of time."
1982.82-65,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1330.637,1334.511,What were the dates of those decisions?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1334.511,1336.449,There was a 1964 case.
1982.82-65,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1336.449,1338.213,Was that after Reynolds v. Sims?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1338.213,1339.603,"Yes, it was."
1982.82-65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1421.79,1424.569,Were... were any of these cases reviewed here?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1424.569,1433.457,"Yes, Your Honor, there was one, Harrison versus Schaefer which trailed on the heels of the 1965 case."
1982.82-65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.457,1435.659,And there was a summary affirmance in that instance?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1435.659,1436.503,"Yes, there was."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.994,1492.369,May I ask one other general question?
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1499.804,1507.707,I believe that there may be some reference in the record as to the political makeup of Niobrara County.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.455,1517.547,"And, what is the majority of the legislature?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1517.547,1518.204,Republican.
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.204,1526.389,"Is there a significant... I mean... is it a closely... what is the makeup of the legislature basically, do you recall, generally?"
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1529.842,1532.028,"Frankly, Your Honor, I don't recall."
1982.82-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.028,1535.605,"But you don't, there is no claim here that that is going to be affected by the outcome of this case."
1982.82-65,0,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,1535.605,1535.933,No.
1982.82-65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1554.627,1565.747,Mr. Cox?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1565.747,1571.215,"Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-65,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1605.403,1617.273,"This is an unfair question, but in the light of decisions from this Court in the past, do you think the entire apportionment of the Wyoming House is constitutional?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1617.273,1619.663,"Yes, your Honor, I do."
1982.82-65,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1647.589,1652.416,Those deviations are higher than any that have been upheld here before.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1652.416,1652.946,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.471,1680.827,Well... didn't we summarily affirm a three-judge court back in the '60's?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1680.827,1682.481,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.309,1684.903,"What was the deviation, there?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1684.903,1690.447,--The deviation was either 89 or 90 percent.
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.447,1697.289,Do you think... do you think... that affirmance is... or that three-judge court decision is consistent with our later cases?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1697.289,1701.241,I'm not sure what you're asking.
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.445,1705.693,89 percent is consistent with them?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1705.693,1706.568,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.881,1874.89,"Mr. Cox, is it basically your position that the state policy o having at least one representative from each county would justify any deviation no matter how large?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1874.89,1877.39,"No, Justice O'Connor, we would not take that position."
1982.82-65,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1893.242,1895.882,"What is too far, if 89 percent isn't too far?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1895.882,1901.317,I don't think that that statistic alone tells us the answer to that question.
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.89,1914.593,What if there are only one hundred people in this county?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1918.107,1919.107,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.107,1923.433,Even though the deviation might be five hundred percent?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1923.433,1926.571,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.821,1934.521,And would you be making the same argument if there were five counties like Niobrara?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1934.521,1943.486,"If we looked at all of the statistics and we that there wasn't a threat to the people of the other state, I would be comfortable doing that."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.258,1977.145,So you are really suggesting to us that we return to that... give more weight to that equation?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,1980.957,1984.955,--I wasn't aware that the Court had departed from that.
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.592,2083.665,"These women in the state that... in the House of Representative, there is one person which unconstitutionally elected."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2088.008,2089.288,--If--
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.288,2091.226,It's only one vote out of three hundred.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2091.226,2098.519,"--There's no question that the plaintiffs have to raise this issue, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.519,2107.639,"Would they be entitled to relief from an unconstitutional representative, just one?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2116.839,2121.104,"To an imbecile serving in the legislature, Your Honor?"
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.104,2122.901,Yes.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2122.901,2125.009,"Yes, I think they would have a right to object to that."
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.009,2127.492,"Why don't these people have a right to object, here?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2127.492,2131.569,They have a right to object.
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.895,2137.535,Isn't that an injury to them?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2137.535,2142.205,--It is an injury in a theoretical sense as the district court--
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2142.205,2144.158,Injury... theoretical?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2144.158,2144.72,--Yes.
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.469,2152.094,How do you get around a vote that's an illegal vote.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2156.732,2163.917,--What we're suggesting to the Court is we look at the nature and the degree of injury here.
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.634,2168.007,But you do admit that there is an injury?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2168.007,2173.256,--There is deviation from strict population equality.
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.256,2176.005,"The word was ""injury""."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2176.005,2185.346,"I can't find the injury in the statistically significant sense, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.215,2204.901,A large portion of the opinion was taken up with the fact that this case has been there four times before.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2207.804,2211.115,"That was cited in the opinion, yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.115,2215.114,"So all that we're saying is, is it another run of the same thing?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2215.114,2235.326,"Well, in... the district court was correct in that this, if we take our worse possible jaundice view of this represent... of this apportionment plan, it contains nothing more dilutive of votes than anything previously reviewed by the court... by the district court."
1982.82-65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.024,2247.6,"Well, that appeared here once before."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2247.6,2250.522,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2452.032,2459.452,"If you do not prevail here, what is... what could be the immediate consequence of such a holding?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2459.452,2463.918,"That is somewhat speculative, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.918,2469.166,"The county would have no representation until the legislature comes up with a new plan, would that be the result?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2469.166,2470.524,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2470.524,2479.646,"Well, I though there was a provision that if you fail here the arrangement of a combination with Goshen County would become effective."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2479.646,2480.755,The two counties would be combined.
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2480.755,2481.848,Yes.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2481.848,2482.536,Yes.
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2482.536,2484.675,"Well, then this county doesn't lose if that happens."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2484.675,2486.55,"If loses effective representation, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.829,2495.625,It would share a representative with the other county.
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2495.625,2497.827,It would share a representative in a theoretical sense.
1982.82-65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.153,2509.587,"In other words, are you saying the voters in that other county don't need the people in this county?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2509.587,2512.149,"Unfortunately, that's true."
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2609.172,2620.37,"I don't understand, though, your the Chief Justice that if you lose there has to be legislative action before the situation can be corrected."
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2621.76,2625.913,"I think I might have misunderstood the question, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2625.913,2634.223,"Because I gather... whether the plan is workable or not, if you lose then the combination with Goshen becomes a effective, doesn't it?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2634.223,2634.894,That's correct.
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2634.894,2637.752,And whether or not the legislature does something further will be--
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2637.752,2641.063,"Up to the legislature, that's correct."
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.22,2756.84,--Do you thing any of... any reapportionment plan in any state should be acceptable as longs as majority rule is not threatened?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2756.84,2776.552,"Well, of course, there are other considerations that this Court has addressed in cases like City of Mobile v. Bolden and Rogers v. Herman Lodge, but absence discrimination against the suspect class... we're not looking at a scheme designed to deprive or submerge a minority--"
1982.82-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.552,2789.701,So any rational state policy should justify the plan as long as minority is not put in position given the power to elect a majority to legislature?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2789.701,2790.808,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2790.808,2796.166,"That would really be a departure form one man, one vote, wouldn't it?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2796.166,2810.754,"I don't think so, Justice Brennan, because the whole purpose of one man, one vote, as this Court observed in Connor v. Finch, is preservation of majoritarianism."
1982.82-65,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.558,2836.196,"Mr. Cox, as a matter of history, how often has the state changed its county boundaries?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2836.196,2846.158,There have been isolated examples where counties have split off... maybe a large county was divided... I don't know what much about the history of that.
1982.82-65,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.158,2851.016,Is there any... can that be done by the state legislature or does it take a constitutional amendment?
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2851.016,2858.668,"I believe it has to be... the voters of the county are involved, and then it has to be approved by the legislature."
1982.82-65,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.444,2870.582,"For example, if Niobrara and the adjoining county wanted to merge and become one county, they could do it by referendum within the county, approved by the state legislature, or something like that?"
1982.82-65,1,38974,randall_t_cox,,2870.582,2871.927,"--Yes, I believe that could be done."
1982.82-65,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2907.537,2912.755,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Davidson?"
1982.82-65,2,41232,suellen_l_davidson,,2912.755,2929.526,"Of course it is the appellant's position that the 89 percent overall relative range is a per se, if you will, violation of the constitution."
1982.82-65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3137.054,3138.846,"Thank you, counsel."
