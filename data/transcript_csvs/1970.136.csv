1970.136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.013,oWhiteley against the Warden of Wyoming State Penitentiary.
1970.136,0,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,26.893,27.508,Thank you sir.
1970.136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.22,113.237,When was he tried originally?
1970.136,0,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,113.237,117.681,He was tried in May 1965 Your Honor.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1052.016,1055.856,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, counsel."
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.739,1215.217,"Well, when was the search before or after?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1215.217,1220.708,The search was taken on the 24th sir.
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.728,1234.414,"One thing in the record, that the time that the search was made other than the broadcast that the arresting officer had to operate them."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1234.414,1237.033,"Excuse me sir, I’m not sure I understand the question?"
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.033,1250.701,"Is the arresting officer and the service, if anything is substantial that at the time the search was made other than the broadcast."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1250.701,1252.941,"No sir, there wasn’t and we feel that --"
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.941,1255.145,How was that search legal?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1255.145,1255.84,Sir?
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1255.84,1258.705,Now is that search legal?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1258.705,1261.442,Well based on the probable cause concept.
1970.136,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.442,1270.06,What you’re saying in effect is that the arrest at least broadcast is in itself a probable cause.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1270.06,1271.85,Yes it is Your Honor.
1970.136,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1271.85,1282.893,What the underlying circumstances were at that time with respect to the law enforcement agencies on this particular government.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1282.893,1283.914,I think you’re absolutely correct.
1970.136,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.914,1285.698,That’s what the proposition is?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1285.698,1286.372,Yes.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.574,1297.748,"Is that the critical proposition here that if an arresting officer lead through the radio that he is supposed to arrest a man, he can arrest them?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1297.748,1304.021,"That’s not the critical proposition Justice White, the critical proposition is whether or not there was probable cause --"
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.021,1305.417,Some American just --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1305.417,1309.041,Yes and the probable cause existed as a record bears it out.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.041,1310.417,Now what was that?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1310.417,1317.386,Well simply the fact of -- the particulars detailed in the police broadcast.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.899,1330.952,"Well, you are saying that the probable cause, is that obtained in the police broadcast, that’s all the arresting officer did."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1330.952,1332.023,"Right, right."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.023,1341.86,Let’s assume that the officer looking out to broadcast himself at no probable cause to put it out.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1345.365,1345.8,No.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.8,1345.98,They couldn't describe themselves?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1345.98,1350.792,"No, no, I couldn’t say that in good conscience because that’s not the law."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.792,1357.977,And then what would -- you conceive that there must be probable cause in the police department that up the broadcast.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1357.977,1367.401,"No, I’m saying if it please the Court and in this reflected on one of the questions that Chuck Ogburn, the sheriff had probable cause."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.998,1372.064,All right and you’re saying -- and you concede that he asked some help?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1372.064,1372.645,Yes.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.645,1373.725,"All right, what was it?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1375.39,1382.239,"The probable cause was the information that he had, that Whiteley had committed the crime or he felt he had committed the crime."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.239,1384.453,"Well, Ogburn didn’t see or commit the crime?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1384.453,1385.453,No.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.591,1388.263,And all he had is a telephone tip --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1388.263,1391.811,"Well, now this is where the record is void, Your Honor."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.517,1393.537,The record is what?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1393.537,1395.886,Void -- this type of information.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.886,1397.841,Well I know but like what?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1397.841,1399.191,And this is our argument.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.977,1410.111,What about that?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1411.92,1412.515,"Yes, and we --"
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.515,1425.656,-- because one of the facts that Ogburn had which this record disposes from which we may make the inference that they add up the probable cause that --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1425.656,1428.24,May I cite you record references if it please the Court?
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.24,1431.275,It has been so found --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1431.275,1439.404,"Record 17, which is the Laramie police Department bulletin, record 31 which was --"
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.404,1440.761,"What, what, what was that?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1440.761,1441.894,Record 17 --
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.894,1443.351,Is this the broadcast police?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1443.351,1447.254,"No, this is what was posted at the Laramie Police Department bulletin board."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.254,1451.501,"Well, obviously, I am not that familiar with that state."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1453.265,1454.116,The Carbon County.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.116,1456.523,"All right, this is the Laramie, this is --"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1456.523,1457.09,At Albany County.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.09,1458.323,"No, Ogburn’s County?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1458.323,1461.163,"No, Sheriff Ogburn’s county was Carbon County."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.163,1464.773,"It’s Carbon County, all right."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1465.517,1467.283,"No, I might be confusing the Court."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.52,1469.816,That should be interesting.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1469.816,1471.892,Let’s start on page 31.
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1488.082,1489.4,What page now?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1489.4,1490.405,Page 31 sir.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.405,1492.079,"Now, this is the broadcast Mr. Speight."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1492.079,1492.869,Yes.
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.869,1496.077,Where is the warrant?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1496.077,1497.169,Well --
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.169,1498.033,I’m confused --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1498.033,1498.927,This is the question --
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.927,1500.284,-- in a sense that --
1970.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1500.284,1505.025,In response to this colloquy because I thought it matches the defined question.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1515.354,1517.636,"Albany County in Laramie, Wyoming."
1970.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1517.636,1523.339,Acting on this police broadcast that was the probable cause.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1548.853,1560.514,"This was a fact determination made by the Wyoming Supreme Court and has been substantiated throughout, that the Laramie law enforcement officers had probable cause to make the arrest not only that but they had the duty to make the arrest."
1970.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1563.309,1575.278,And now you say to my brother White that you -- you think that there must be something in the way of probable cause in the part of the authorities who issued the broadcast.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1575.278,1590.274,"Well, I didn’t make the original case, the Wyoming Supreme Court although -- this is in the record and I don’t know what the Wyoming Supreme Court gaged its theories on except what they write and what they write --"
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.274,1591.721,We really aren’t concerned what the --
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1591.721,1592.044,I know Your Honor.
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.044,1595.191,What this theory was -- we want to know what the facts are just hold it a minute now.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1595.191,1596.785,All right sir.
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.785,1607.042,"What was the probable cause that Sheriff Ogburn had on which he could have arrested this man that he saw him driving down the street, that’s what we want to know."
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1607.042,1610.097,In this the record is the void officer.
1970.136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.097,1615.199,"Well, did he have the information that he included in the arrest warrant?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1615.855,1622.677,"Yes, he had that and he had the information that appears in the state item 881."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.677,1624.583,Was that a probable cause?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1624.583,1626.441,This I don’t know.
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.441,1629.789,You know -- I mean you know what was in the point?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1629.789,1630.855,"Yes sir, I do."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.855,1633.151,Was that detriment of probable cause?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1633.151,1635.12,"In my feeling, indeed sir."
1970.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.12,1645.282,Even though all that really amounts to is that he had word other that by his informant that this defendant does that job.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1647.338,1650.579,"Yes, that’s correct."
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1650.579,1652.766,Was this about the man in the car?
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1652.766,1655.58,"Yes, it was sir."
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1655.58,1659.877,"Do you had an information, how far was he away?"
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1659.877,1665.082,"At that time, how far was the petitioner, the defendant away from --"
1970.136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.082,1665.79,Yes.
1970.136,1,32975,jack_speight,,1665.79,1666.42,They didn’t know.
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2591.209,2591.291,Yes sir.
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.291,2597.868,"I suppose as a practical matter, that explains why the case is here."
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2597.868,2599.653,I think so Your Honor.
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.262,2618.663,And how many convictions does that take -- how many prior?
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2618.663,2620.208,I think it takes three Your Honor.
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.208,2621.172,Three.
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2621.172,2622.983,He had more than three.
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2703.182,2725.455,"Well, Mr. Speight argued among other things that when this issue was up, it was not challenged and that therefore you have waived the infirmities and probable cause by not pursuing – this is not mine -- I’m not advancing that, I’m asking you to respond to that argument."
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2727.56,2728.684,I don’t think there was a waive.
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2756.749,2766.422,The absence of a motion to suppress has deprived the Trial Court right from the beginning of an opportunity to pass on this question at the time when it could have been passed on.
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2766.422,2775.928,Yes Your Honor but I think that if a lawyer does fail to move to suppress that he perhaps can raise this at the trial level with the Court’s permission.
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.022,2800.589,Was there an objection to the evidence on trial?
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2800.589,2802.352,"Yes there was an objection to the evidence, yes."
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.364,2814.527,"And I gather under Wyoming procedure, this maybe raised by objection to the evidence of the trial even though no motion to suppress is made before the trial."
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2814.527,2816.019,I believe so Your Honor.
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.161,2833.356,"In other words, opposition to the objection was not made on the ground that no motion to suppress had been made before the trial."
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2833.356,2834.535,"Right, Your Honor."
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.813,2845.817,"And once they said -- once he got brought out that was from a tip, he had negative personal knowledge on the part of the officer."
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2845.817,2849.347,"Once he asked him if it came out by a tip, the matter was just dropped."
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.037,2851.244,Isn’t that enough?
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2851.244,2851.841,I think --
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.841,2853.356,Is that enough for that defense to --
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2853.356,2854.517,I think so Your Honor.
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.29,2859.572,Would you have gone to ahead and build the state's case on?
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2859.572,2865.522,If I had been the county attorney then I would have certainly proven that there was a reliable informant etcetera.
1970.136,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2912.376,2915.671,Don’t you think somebody had told the sheriff something about him?
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2915.671,2918.297,"Oh yes, I don’t say that sheriff was perjuring himself."
1970.136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2944.75,2951.04,And he might have added that you will find the stolen coins --[Laughter]
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,2951.04,2954.879,I’m sure that that was added Your Honor.
1970.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.98,3028.413,"Well, if you win, this case would just be reversed --"
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,3028.413,3037.189,"In my opinion Your Honor, if this case is reversed and sent back to Rawlins, the county attorney will have to see what evidence he has."
1970.136,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.612,3050.068,Well I gather the form anyway if you prevail would be to send it back to District Court.
1970.136,2,45245,william_k_knudsen_jr,,3056.941,3065.521,"Well, I think it should be sent back to the District Court and the District Court should be ordered to send -- to order a new trial in the state court."
