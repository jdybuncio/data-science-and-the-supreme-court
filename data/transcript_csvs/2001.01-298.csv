2001.01-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,10.031,15.044,"Spectators are admonished, do not talk until you get outside the courtroom."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,25.058,39.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a State affirmatively invokes the jurisdiction of the Federal court by removing a case, that acts as a waiver of the State's forum immunity to Federal jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment."
2001.01-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.328,72.325,"When you say as an actor in any role, does it ever intervene as a defendant?"
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,72.325,74.487,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.186,89.536,How about the Ford Motor Company case?
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,89.536,103.282,"Well, of course, the authorization requirement in Ford Motor... and that's the particular holding in Ford Motor that I think is of concern to this Court... need not be reached here because, of course, Ford Motor did not involve a case where a State was actually invoking Federal court jurisdiction."
2001.01-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.397,118.681,"So, you think a line can be drawn between the State defendant being drawn in as a respondent or involuntarily as opposed to removing and thereby invoking Federal jurisdiction."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,118.681,119.258,"--Yes, Chief Justice."
2001.01-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,151.208,159.176,"In all... in all those cases, they were cases in which a State really consented to have litigated against it a Federal claim in a Federal court."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,206.276,210.28,"If I may make a number of responses to your question, Justice Breyer."
2001.01-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,257.341,258.017,All right.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,292.097,310.756,"--Well, Justice Breyer, again with respect I think the... the proper analysis I think closely analyzing the State's professed interests in removing and claiming immunity was, first of all, to engage the expertise of Federal tribunals on questions arising under section 1983 and qualified immunity."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.756,312.326,May I stop you there?
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,324.974,325.701,That... that's--
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,325.701,332.304,--That's the basis of... you're suing the State and the State is not a person within 1983.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,341.798,356.37,"--Justice Ginsburg, I... I would remind the Court that, of course, there was relief pled for declaratory relief in the complaint, and under this Court's jurisprudence following from Will, a declaratory relief claim is properly pled in this kind of proceeding."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.585,358.245,--Against the State?
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,370.776,371.891,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.275,396.783,"Well, Ex parte Young is something different."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,398.89,407.807,"--That's right, but recall that not only are the regions being sued here but also individuals in their official capacity and as well as in... in their individual capacity."
2001.01-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.807,409.664,No.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,451.933,463.656,"Well, again, my response to that would be plaintiffs do have an interest in seeing... in filing a single, unitary action in State court, as was properly done here."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.256,476.454,I don't understand that either.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,485.826,486.569,That's correct.
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.569,487.805,And now you're getting just what you want.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,490.034,498.557,"Well, it's... it's the remand apparently with the... the other consequences of the Federal court decisions to date."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.124,514.804,"But there's been no kind of adjudication on the merits against the State... against the State entity in any way, shape, or form."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,514.804,515.835,No.
2001.01-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.609,532.099,May I ask why it proceeded... let me read you something else from one... a fairly recent opinion.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,557.917,560.417,"--I... I do not know, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.044,620.232,"But that seems to be a purely academic question not in this case because the qualified immunity question, as I understand it, was decided against the individual officers."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,628.794,635.093,--If... if you're not taking well my point about the availability of declaratory relief--
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.093,639.263,"Well, at least the footnote that was read didn't make any distinction based on declaratory judgment."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,646.155,649.294,"--I would never presume such, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,673.565,680.252,"But if you're not right about 1983, assume now that a State is not a person for purposes of 1983."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,680.252,680.873,--Yes.
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.873,685.825,Then what Federal element... what Federal question is left in the case?
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,685.825,686.901,There would be none left.
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.901,702.422,"And then with all the Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence in the world, it would make sense for any district judge to hang onto a case that at the threshold had all the Federal elements taken out of it and has nothing but State claims left."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,702.422,714.326,"Certainly after these proceedings, that might be the result that a district court judge in the exercise of... of its discretion may wish to... to achieve."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.285,748.695,I don't see how that... how your client is in any way harmed by any of this because he ends up with what he wanted is his suit in State court.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,748.695,751.834,"--Well, if I may make a broader point."
2001.01-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,831.832,833.689,But that's the end result you're getting.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,853.463,857.261,"--Well, again, I would not presume to anticipate the future proceedings and that may--"
2001.01-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.261,863.372,"Well, your legal position is basically that a State should not be able to talk out of both sides of its mouth I guess."
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,875.55,890.903,"--Well, I think even though petitioner is, understandably, reluctant to introduce an idiom of judicial estoppel into these proceedings with... with obviously the clear indication that rules of estoppel tend not to run against the sovereign, but again that is precisely our concern."
2001.01-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.753,904.528,"May I ask you, Mr. Bederman?"
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,917.16,919.305,"Well, if I may review quickly."
2001.01-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.423,944.364,They're only after monetary relief.
2001.01-298,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,944.364,949.498,I would not want to put that gloss on... on the States.
2001.01-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.581,988.779,"Very well, Mr. Bederman."
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,992.307,1012.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For four reasons, a State's removal of a case to Federal court waives its forum immunity, permitting adjudication of the claims against the State in Federal--"
2001.01-298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1012.185,1019.161,Explain to me whether we've ever bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit... from suit?
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1022.133,1026.758,--They are both protections that are afforded by the Eleventh Amendment.
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.683,1085.208,"Mr. Gornstein, may I deflect you?"
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1115.013,1120.131,"To the extent that there are constitutional claims against a State, that's correct."
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.419,1144.984,"Would a district judge be acting reasonably to hold onto a case that has no Federal claim that involves the State tort claims act, that those are... the State claims are under the State's own tort claims act, like the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1153.279,1160.338,"--Justice Ginsburg, that would be a question for the exercise of the district court's discretion under the supplemental jurisdiction grounds."
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1174.623,1179.657,It was always my understanding that the district court would take into account how far have we gotten into the case--
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1179.657,1180.317,Correct.
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.317,1181.143,--from the Federal--
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1181.143,1181.681,Right.
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1181.681,1184.487,"--If you drop here, the Federal issue drops out at the very threshold."
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1184.487,1194.063,"Correct, and that would argue more strongly in favor of the district court exercising its discretion in that direction, assuming there's no other Federal claim in the case."
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1227.833,1234.187,I thought the... the motion to dismiss as to the individuals was granted on the grounds of qualified immunity.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1234.187,1242.732,"--Only as to the claims against them in their personal capacities, not as... with respect to the claims against them in their official capacities."
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.791,1257.843,I don't understand the difference between a claim against the State itself and the claim against the State officer in his or her official capacity.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1257.843,1267.807,"The distinction that the court drew was... is this... traces its origins to Ex parte Young, that that is a suit against the officer in his official capacity."
2001.01-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.463,1277.671,"What Mr. Lapides wants... Mr. Lapides, as I understand it, wants a money judgment."
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1277.671,1294.539,"--I think it's... it's largely true that he wants a money judgment, but there is one allegation in his complaint upon which he relies in saying that he's also seeking declaratory relief against an individual... an individual officer in his official capacity."
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.539,1296.109,"So, that's like suing the State."
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1304.859,1310.515,"I would say... I don't want to quibble too much with the semantics, but I would just... I would put it this way."
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1318.772,1313.775,All right.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1322.859,1323.973,"--No, they did not--"
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1323.973,1324.466,Oh.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1326.945,1328.636,"--If it was ever there, Justice Breyer--"
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.636,1329.379,Fine.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1329.834,1330.865,--it's still there.
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1330.865,1332.64,"Now, if that's so, how could it not be an abuse of discretion?"
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1339.327,1340.525,Again--
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.525,1341.351,A purely State matter.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1354.809,1356.046,--Well--
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.046,1357.698,--be an abuse of discretion not to.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1357.698,1359.927,--It... it wouldn't have a right to have the case sent back.
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1359.927,1360.504,Why not?
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1360.504,1362.733,It would never... because it's a matter for the district court--
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.733,1364.673,There is an abuse of discretion under certain circumstances.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1364.673,1365.499,--And what I would say--
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1365.499,1366.243,Yes.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1366.243,1369.132,--That would be the question whether there is an abuse of discretion.
2001.01-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1369.132,1369.503,And why not?
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1369.503,1395.677,"And the... I don't want to argue that part of the case too much, but the reason would be if there are still Federal law claims against... 1983 games against the... individuals and they arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts with the claims against the State, then it would still be fair to try those claims in Federal court because the State made a voluntary choice to bring this case into Federal court."
2001.01-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.741,1431.092,Are you saying that it's a different case because the State removed it than it would have been if the same factual circumstance had occurred in the case originally brought in the district court?
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1431.092,1448.554,"--I am, Mr. Chief Justice, because under this Court's decision in Pennhurst, if a plaintiff files a suit in Federal court that includes both Federal law claims and State law claims, the State law claims against the State are... have to be dismissed under Pennhurst."
2001.01-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.859,1558.029,"Well, the State is certainly entitled to make a tactical judgment--"
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1558.029,1558.568,It certainly is.
2001.01-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.568,1561.168,--that it's better off in Federal court than it is in State court.
2001.01-298,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1561.168,1575.036,"It absolutely is, Mr. Chief Justice, and all we are saying is once it does that, then it has to accept the consequences of that choice, which is the Federal court then has authority to adjudicate the entire case that has been brought before them... before it."
2001.01-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.299,1601.581,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1603.81,1624.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State, along with its employees, removed this case to Federal court so that its employees could take advantage of a... in a Federal forum."
2001.01-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1634.951,1640.795,Is it a waiver of forum immunity as opposed to immunity from suit?
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1643.19,1654.724,"--Your Honor, this Court has never made such a distinction, and the first I've ever heard of the concept of forum immunity being parceled out from the rest of the immunity was in this case."
2001.01-298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.81,1672.374,"It's not... it's... I mean, the concept has been around."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1684.717,1687.046,"Your Honor, the concept of what--"
2001.01-298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.046,1693.429,"Which... which means that... that you can be immune in one forum and not immune in another forum, although you're not immune from the suit entirely."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1693.429,1705.772,"--Your Honor, that is exactly what the Court found in Pennhurst, but I would suggest that the Court has also found in Pennhurst that the absence of that choice, that concrete choice, would emasculate the Eleventh Amendment."
2001.01-298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.578,1719.64,"Well, that's... you know, that's too bad, isn't it?"
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1719.64,1722.258,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2001.01-298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.258,1727.98,The cost of getting the advantage of Federal courts is that you... you come into Federal court.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1735.698,1741.848,"--Your Honor, first of all, I'd like to point out that that cost is just too high."
2001.01-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.878,1777.68,"But that's a right of the State of Georgia to protect the individual employees, and the State of Georgia has said the right to an interlocutory appeal is not all that important."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1790.479,1796.052,"--Georgia absolutely can make that decision, Your Honor, through its legislative process, and that's part of the point."
2001.01-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1796.052,1801.003,"Well, why shouldn't that decision also influence the tactical decisions of the attorney general when he's litigating?"
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1801.003,1806.016,Because the attorney general represents more than just the State in a lawsuit such as this.
2001.01-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.433,1823.477,But it's the State of Georgia's legislature who have made the decision that's troubling for the State of Georgia's employees.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1823.477,1826.433,"--Your Honor, but the employees have to take the law as it is."
2001.01-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.433,1833.12,"Well, and the legislature didn't say that no Georgia employee shall ever have an interlocutory appeal in any court."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1835.471,1845.957,"That's correct, and Congress has seen fit to allow for a procedural device for State defendants or any other defendants to take advantage of the procedures available to them."
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1847.321,1849.672,But you're missing one very key thing here.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1892.108,1897.598,"--First of all, Your Honor, Congress did not expressly state that all defendants needed to agree."
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.935,1904.202,It's a court interpretation of the removal statute.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1904.202,1905.567,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.567,1907.174,And... and you're not going to challenge that.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,1914.855,1917.538,"Your Honor, all that is true."
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.183,1981.644,"Ms. Orland, then it seems to me the obvious thing that the zealous representative of the State would say is, sorry, we can't join in the removal petition."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2007.651,2014.793,"Your Honor, I understand the concerns of the Court regarding the concept of saying we're going to Federal court, but no, we're not."
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2035.227,2036.713,There's nothing wrong with the statute.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2056.775,2058.632,--Your Honor--
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2058.632,2065.692,"It seems to me that the case on Georgia's own theory is non-removable from day one, and that's the position that Georgia should have taken."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2068.125,2091.159,"--Then by very virtue of a sham joinder of the State in a case, which in this case arguably was done by suing the case... State under 1983 and further by attempting to sue the State, for which there has been no waiver of sovereign immunity as to defamation of liable, a plaintiff can shamly decide that individuals won't be entitled to--"
2001.01-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2091.159,2093.388,The plaintiff in this case wanted to be in the State court.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2114.815,2124.968,"--Your Honor, I think that the problem here is, is that by virtue of 1983 litigation, individual employees get sued."
2001.01-298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.166,2149.405,"But... but you're asking for a broader principle, which it may well be that in... in its application to your case there's some... you can understand why the... why the State wanted to go into Federal court."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2169.345,2173.554,"--Your Honor, I would agree it's absurd, and that type of behavior could be sanctioned by the court."
2001.01-298,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2184.122,2188.209,On what... on what grounds would you sanction the behavior if you're saying that it's lawful.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2190.066,2192.667,"--Your Honor, if it--"
2001.01-298,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.667,2196.232,"You're saying, counsel, you have exercised every right that we can give you under the law."
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2197.581,2198.628,--I'm sorry if I misspoke.
2001.01-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.545,2211.243,Lawyers do all sorts of things for the purposes of delay.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2212.07,2213.018,--And it's improper.
2001.01-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.018,2215.535,I'm not... I'm not sure it is.
2001.01-298,2,21326,devon_orland,,2229.176,2242.079,"There's nothing improper about that, but in the scenario that if it is improper, if it is determined that there is some attempt to elongate litigation for an improper purpose, the court has the discretion to sanction that behavior."
2001.01-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.135,2247.447,"Yes, but you're not... they're not elongating the case."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2808.198,2834.409,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision to waive sovereign immunity and consent to suit traditionally rests with the State's legislature, a body uniquely able to both balance challenges to the public fisc and determine when such a waiver is both in the citizens' will and the public good."
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.409,2842.665,"Have we inquired, when States bring a suit in Federal court, whether the State attorney general has authority to appear?"
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2854.926,2856.7,"No, Your Honor, the Court has not."
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.7,2857.239,We have not.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2866.981,2867.846,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.214,2882.874,Excuse me.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2883.738,2885.762,"--The res, the subject matter of the litigation."
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.762,2900.435,"So, you say the attorney general, even though he has no power to waive State sovereign immunity, can achieve a waiver of State sovereign immunity by bringing suit which is subject to a compulsory counterclaim."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2900.435,2909.91,"He does have the authority to represent the State, and presumably he has the authority also by the legislature to bring the cause of action that he is asserting with the State as a plaintiff."
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.91,2916.598,"So, the same here when... when he doesn't have authority to waive sovereign immunity, but he has authority to remove to Federal court."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2920.519,2930.14,"But the two are specifically different because, as a defendant, you're looking at this... it would be an implied waiver as opposed to an express waiver."
2001.01-298,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.549,2941.695,Why isn't that an implied waiver too?
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2963.243,2970.635,"--Well, that is the situation that occurred in Gardner, Your Honor, for the... for the proof of claim instance with bankruptcy litigation."
2001.01-298,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.955,2983.471,"Well, you speak of the res of the litigation."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2993.048,2995.444,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-298,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.961,2999.159,There's no... there's no res there.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,2999.159,3006.505,"--But it is the subject matter of the litigation; that is, his... that would be what the State would be adjudicating."
2001.01-298,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.169,3025.37,"What happens under State law, say, in Texas if... it's a tort action."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3037.63,3043.574,The Texas Supreme Court has held that sovereign immunity is subject matter jurisdiction.
2001.01-298,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.574,3052.119,"So, in other words, you can come in in Texas, a jury is about to come in, you're just about to lose the case, the last minute you discover this defense, and just they'll... they'll dismiss the case?"
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3052.119,3055.546,"That actually, to my knowledge, has not happened yet."
2001.01-298,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.859,3058.907,They wouldn't say you had waived it.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3058.907,3059.838,No.
2001.01-298,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.49,3062.522,I know you wouldn't assert that.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3064.091,3065.494,--We would hope the judge would agree with us.
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.295,3083.782,--I don't... I don't object to that.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3098.726,3099.757,--Well--
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.757,3101.531,You can have all the sovereign immunity you want.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3104.687,3113.42,"--And all... all we are really asking for, Justice Scalia, is to have the same defenses that would be available to us if the plaintiff had chosen to file the lawsuit in Federal court."
2001.01-298,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3122.625,3125.392,"Well, they could be adjudicated in State court, couldn't they?"
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3126.795,3127.621,They could be.
2001.01-298,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3129.7,3133.111,What they don't like here is no interlocutory appeal I gather.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3133.111,3135.218,"Yes, that is... that's true."
2001.01-298,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3135.218,3136.083,"Well, that's the State's own fault."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3140.929,3149.169,"They could, but in the Johnson case, of course, this Court stated that the State courts do not have to have a parallel system similar to the Federal courts."
2001.01-298,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3149.169,3155.856,I take it the State of Texas is not asserting that its courts are less capable of interpreting Federal law than Federal courts are?
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3155.856,3156.433,"Not... not at all, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-298,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.314,3162.915,"In fact, you prefer your interpretation of Federal law, don't you?"
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.607,3176.207,It seems to me everything that you've said leads to the conclusion that this was a non-removable case from day one and that the State should not have... should not have joined that removal petition.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3176.207,3186.488,Actually that... we do not agree with that because there's no clear statement in the removal statute indicating that the State would have waived its immunity had it removed.
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3193.297,3194.783,I don't get... I don't get it all.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3223.101,3230.449,--But that would be similar to the... to the argument they made in Schacht in that you cannot remove a case with barred claims.
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3234.331,3236.493,Not barred... the statute of limitations is a defense.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3257.281,3267.146,"--Well, it may be a fine distinction, but consenting to the removal, we would argue and is argued in the briefs, is not the same thing as consenting to waive our Eleventh Amendment immunity."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.871,3282.257,What... what do you think is at stake now?
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3294.433,3300.749,"--I believe that... that Georgia, when they moved... when they answered, they both raised Will and the Eleventh Amendment in their answer."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.863,3312.471,"So, it seems to me that we are arguing over an academic question because no matter what, this case is going to return to the Georgia State court."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3312.471,3315.46,It's not academic on this... for this point.
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3335.3,3336.703,"Yes, but all those could be very interesting questions."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3349.706,3350.988,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3350.988,3358.706,"--And I had thought that in the recent case we had said if you have that picture, the Federal court is supposed to deal with the 1983."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3360.109,3361.39,"Yes, Vermont Agency."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3362.626,3363.62,"Yes, right."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3363.62,3364.567,"That it could be dealt with first, yes."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3364.567,3365.31,Right.
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3365.31,3372.908,"That is entirely possible, and the district court... it would have been well advised to have done that, but the district court did not choose to do that."
2001.01-298,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3374.598,3379.595,"But in any... any way you look at this, the case ends up in... in the State court."
2001.01-298,3,32363,julie_c_parsley,,3383.515,3391.399,"Well, to the extent that the petitioner is challenging the Eleventh Circuit's judgment, they do want to remain in Federal court."
2001.01-298,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3414.518,3415.548,"Thank you, Ms. Parsley."
2001.01-298,4,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3418.233,3427.454,"If I may, Justice Ginsburg, I was not entirely as helpful as I could have been in response to your earlier lines of questioning."
2001.01-298,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3472.762,3475.568,Are you talking about paragraph 26 of the complaint?
2001.01-298,4,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3475.568,3477.22,"Yes, sir, I am."
2001.01-298,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3477.22,3483.249,"Well, that just says, I want a judicial finding that what Kansas did amounts to defamation."
2001.01-298,4,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3488.366,3510.657,"Well, I think, of course, all paragraphs in a complaint need to be read together in view of the earlier allegations, in view of this course of conduct interfering with Professor Lapides' constitutionally granted due process rights at both paragraphs 1 and at paragraph 8 of the complaint."
2001.01-298,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3516.064,3517.057,Read them together.
2001.01-298,4,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3537.612,3538.25,--No.
2001.01-298,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3623.888,3626.034,"Well, I don't mean to pursue a red horse."
2001.01-298,4,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3632.144,3638.088,--It does... neither paragraph 1 nor 8 specifically refers to declaratory relief.
2001.01-298,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3651.547,3652.866,Thank you.
