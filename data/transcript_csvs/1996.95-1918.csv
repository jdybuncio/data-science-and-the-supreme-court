1996.95-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.179,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1918, Arkansas v. Farm Credit Services of Central Arkansas."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,71.847,75.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1918,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.077,124.684,"I'm curious to know, was the Anti-Injunction Act point, the jurisdictional point argued in the Ninth Circuit... pardon me, in the Eighth Circuit or in the briefs that were filed?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,124.684,127.167,It was argued in the district court--
1996.95-1918,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,127.167,128.017,I noticed that.
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,128.017,128.978,--but not in the Eighth Circuit.
1996.95-1918,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.978,131.149,Not in the briefs and not in the oral argument?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,131.149,133.643,"Not in either, that's correct."
1996.95-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.206,223.36,"When you say appears, Ms. Hunt, do you mean appears as a party plaintiff, rather than just perhaps files an amicus brief?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,223.36,223.991,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.843,249.749,"Well, certainly the courts have recognized some implied exemptions from that Tax Injunction Act, haven't they?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,249.749,250.779,"--That is correct, Justice--"
1996.95-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.779,252.021,"For example, for the NLRB."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,252.021,263.828,--I am not aware that in the context of the Tax Injunction Act there has been an exemption applied for the NLRB.
1996.95-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.686,276.207,Right.
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,276.207,279.569,One point that I would like to make--
1996.95-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.569,280.29,So what's the test?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,285.583,291.319,--Our test that we would like to advocate to the Court is a bright line test.
1996.95-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.163,302.936,And that's the only instance?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,308.6,313.361,I don't believe... I believe they do disagree with that in some respect.
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.308,359.292,Why leave it to the executive branch to decide what's an instrumentality that is deserving of the exemption and what isn't?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,378.776,381.139,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does appear that that would be the case."
1996.95-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.128,412.382,"Well, so far as the United States being a party, you're stuck with the decision of the Department of Employment Security."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,418.268,419.057,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1918,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.483,447.687,Your bright line... I just want to be sure I understand... is a distinction between an agency and an instrumentality.
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,447.687,448.118,That is correct.
1996.95-1918,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.118,450.238,And what is the difference between the two?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,450.238,459.495,I believe that in most cases an agency would be designated by statute as an agency of the Government.
1996.95-1918,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.034,465.398,Suppose the statute had called this entity an agency instead of an instrument?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,472.664,474.935,--The instrumentality--
1996.95-1918,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.935,480.678,And I'm just wondering how you know so clearly as to such a bright line that tells us whether it's an instrumentality or an agency.
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,481.058,490.496,"--That is why we would advocate an even more bright line, actually, and draw the line and say, if any entity appears the United States should appear."
1996.95-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.207,502.263,"--And you would say, then, that Nash-Finch, the NLRB case, deals with the Anti-Injunction Act generally, not with the Tax Injunction Act."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,502.263,509.797,"That is correct, Your Honor, and there are, too... there is a difference in the purpose of those two acts that I would also like to distinguish."
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.659,565.843,"So you really expect us to hold that if the President is annoyed with the National Labor Relations Board and instructs the Solicitor General or the Civil Division of the Justice Department not to appeal in order to enable that agency to claim the benefit of the exemption from the Anti-Injunction Act, then that's the way it will be?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,565.843,567.676,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.866,573.981,Regardless of what Congress... it has nothing to do with Congress' intention to establish the NLRB as an agency of the United States.
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,577.383,584.128,"--Under the bright... under the absolute bright line test for the presence of the United States, that would be necessary."
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.93,597.799,"Can you tell me why I should do that, why I should leave this issue of law under a congressional statute to be decided dispositively by the President of the United States?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,597.799,618.85,"--Obviously, if the President of the United States, the executive department, examines the entity that it is there to represent and makes this determination to appear, under the bright line test that would be a decision that would be left to the executive department."
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.52,643.046,"What if the President, during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt the Civil Division does appear on behalf the labor board and says, this is an agency of the United States."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,666.842,670.435,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe it could be undone."
1996.95-1918,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,710.452,719.548,"Ms. Hunt, may I ask you a question about the discrete jurisdictional issue, which this Court asked the parties to address."
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,739.961,741.223,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1918,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.978,788.914,--Why wouldn't it make sense to have the test simply be whether Federal dollars are at stake as the exemption for the Tax Injunction Act?
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,788.914,804.375,"If the only test were whether or not Federal dollars were at stake, there would be many, many entities who would then be entitled to the benefit of the Tax Injunction Act."
1996.95-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.824,897.709,"Ms. Hunt, could we borrow a test from somewhere else?"
1996.95-1918,0,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,913.402,939.118,"In the sense of sovereign immunity this has frequently been addressed by statute, by the sue-and-be-sued statutes, so this alone would not be a sufficient test because that might have been spoken to by Congress already, and then you would have to enter into that sphere of statutory language dealing with the sue-and-be-sued provision."
1996.95-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,940.821,942.163,"Yes, you may, Ms. Hunt."
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,944.053,956.362,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.809,1048.523,"When the Congress incorporates... a Federal corporation has a Federal charter, is it always an instrumentality?"
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1048.523,1052.926,Sometimes they're designated an instrumentality.
1996.95-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1059.411,1065.517,"I should have asked, and it's apparent from your question, they are not always designated instrumentalities apparently."
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1065.517,1066.347,Not always.
1996.95-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1162.126,1164.256,"Well, what about the Red Cross?"
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1181.627,1194.005,"There... there it was held to be entitled to a tax immunity, but it was not held to be within the exception to the Tax Injunction Act."
1996.95-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.245,1209.209,"Mr. Wallace, I hate to go on creating different tests for all these different purposes."
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1214.373,1215.264,"Well, I--"
1996.95-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.264,1223.098,Not... not... leaving out the situation where the Government has said that a particular instrumentality can or cannot sue or be sued.
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1236.107,1239.651,"--Well, I think it's closely related, but I--"
1996.95-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.651,1241.08,I know it's closely related.
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1241.881,1245.875,--There are reasons... there are reasons I would hesitate to say it's the same.
1996.95-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.586,1312.629,"Mr. Wallace, would the answer be... in your view, would the same test apply under both the Tax Injunction Act and the... 2283?"
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1312.629,1319.836,"--I think that it's a good model, and probably would be the same test."
1996.95-1918,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.521,1332.353,"Given that, why isn't... what's wrong with Arkansas' approach?"
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1374.707,1376.386,"Well, what Judge Campbell suggested--"
1996.95-1918,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1376.386,1376.897,What... what does he... yes.
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1376.897,1403.004,"--for the First Circuit on this very point was that the Court should respect the reasons why Congress has chosen to confer independent litigating authority in the lower courts on certain agencies, because they should to some degree be insulated from the executive chain of command, and I think it's very well put."
1996.95-1918,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1405.247,1405.457,Yes.
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1405.457,1407.368,--and rewards study.
1996.95-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1407.368,1410.561,Is it clear that you could have intervened here if you had chosen to do so?
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1410.561,1413.402,"Yes, we could have."
1996.95-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1413.402,1414.744,Under Rule 24 you have an interest?
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1414.744,1418.565,I believe so.
1996.95-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.128,1459.512,You're not saying that the executive branch should have any leverage in deciding whether there's an exemption or not.
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1463.796,1468.898,"--Exactly, so it's up to the courts to decide the merits of the exemption issue."
1996.95-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.983,1517.194,Thank--
1996.95-1918,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1517.194,1518.415,--on page 5 of their brief.
1996.95-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.415,1518.663,"--Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1522.947,1527.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.67,1633.235,"And your position is that unless Congress has affirmatively waived that immunity, they are immune?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1633.235,1641.312,"On the merits, unless Congress has affirmatively consented to the taxation of these entities by Arkansas, 180 years of case law says that we are immune."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.312,1645.593,"Well, there's a lot of case law contrary to that, it seems to me."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1657.301,1672.591,"Well, I'm not aware of any case where this Court has departed from the rule that immunity is implied under the Supremacy Clause, and immunity exists unless Congress has consented to taxation, and certainly that has been--"
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.591,1676.645,And you would say this is true of every single thing that is called a Federal instrumentality?
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1676.645,1682.929,"--If it is a Federal instrumentality, and that really in large part is the crux of this case."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.485,1763.674,"Mr. Hanson, whatever this was originally when there was a Federal administrator involved, is there anything that these entities are doing that the farmers and ranchers couldn't have done getting together for themselves?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1778.682,1784.236,"Well, if they are... there are not in any material way exercising any Federal regulatory power."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1787.558,1792.882,So the only power that they're exercising is what the farmers and the ranchers choose to confer on them.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1792.882,1800.269,"With the support of the United States, but there is a reason why the system was set up this way."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.616,1854.346,"Well, lots of private actors are given Federal help."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1858.851,1873.851,"--The program under which that help is given, the program may or may not be a Federal agency, or a Federal instrumentality, but my point is that the farm credit system does not exist to make profit for its members."
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.432,1894.514,I don't think that's enough to answer the question.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1913.408,1918.82,"--No, I would absolutely agree, and that in part was what was addressed in U.S. v. New Mexico."
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1918.82,1920.302,Yet there's a Government purpose there.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1936.464,1937.015,"Well, I--"
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.015,1941.427,--of whether immunity should exist or whether you ought to go first into State court.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1941.427,1945.751,"--Well, let me contrast perhaps two different institutions."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.871,2005.339,"Well, what functions ally them with the Government rather than with the private members, because I think you answered my question candidly that they can do, these PCA's can do only what the members choose to allow them to do."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2005.339,2010.472,"Well, they can do only what the Government allows them to do under the controlling statute and regulations."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.102,2035.9,"Can you tell me if there are other instrumentalities where all of the people, all of the personnel are on private payrolls, not Government payrolls, that would have this tax immunity--"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2035.9,2036.641,"Well, I think--"
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.641,2038.581,"--from income tax, State income tax?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2038.581,2049.208,"--Certainly the Federal credit unions would be an analogous situation, and one of the ironies in this case... and frankly I want to come back to Justice Scalia's question on the jurisdictional issue."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.591,2084.425,There's a distinction between the... a Federal credit union and the PCA's.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2084.425,2104.247,"There is in the statutory provision describing certain aspects of the tax exemption, but I'm not sure that there's much other than that, and the Sixth Circuit basically compares and contrasts the two and says the only real distinction is one provides financial services to a broader range of the public than the farm credit system does."
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.73,2218.379,"Mr. Hanson suppose you were to say, look, if it is a matter of degree, here we have an organization that looks like an ordinary bank, performs the functions of ordinary banks."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2230.207,2230.988,--Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.988,2245.047,"--and given these similarities between ordinary banks and what's going on here, and the fact that the Treasury is not implicated, this is not a Government instrumentality for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2247.49,2256.035,"--Well, it is interesting that the Government's reference to the Federal Reserve Bank case... for example, the Federal Reserve Banks are capitalized solely by their member banks."
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.035,2258.055,"Ah, but he has large number of things--"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2258.055,2258.296,I know.
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.296,2258.636,--to say--
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2258.636,2260.517,He talks about the regulatory function and so on.
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.352,2268.704,--I'm just saying look at the similarities.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2286.168,2286.766,--Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.766,2288.539,"And given all that, we don't need to go further."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2288.539,2288.91,--Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.91,2290.692,"I mean, that's... that, it seems to me, is what you face here."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2290.692,2299.708,"--The profits, the earnings, as this Court recognized in Kiawah County, are not a distribution of profits to the shareholder of the system."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.993,2310.204,But they do benefit the farmers--
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2310.204,2310.434,The farmer--
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.434,2311.596,--rather than the Government.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2311.596,2312.006,--Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.006,2314.078,"Rather than taxpayers, let's say."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2314.078,2341.795,"--They benefit the Government to this extent, and that is that currently, as part of the package of assistance that was provided in 1987, the system owes the Treasury some $600 million, and not only do they owe the Treasury $600 million, but the Government has implicitly guaranteed the system's bonds, and I realize it's not a statutory guarantee, but the market believes that the Government will support those bonds and, of course, it always has."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.9,2355.384,"You can say that, though, about a lot of the Government contractor cases that were involved... that were discussed in New Mexico."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2362.47,2363.509,That did not make it.
1996.95-1918,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.509,2366.291,"--You can say that about Chrysler Corporation, come to think of it."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2366.291,2368.574,You could say it about them also.
1996.95-1918,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.574,2370.575,If it's just probabilities.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2370.575,2382.532,"But as to none of those could you say that Congress has said this is a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States, and as to none of those could you say that its sole function is to perform an important governmental function."
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.563,2431.488,"What Campbell said, if we go into that, if you want to, he says they're operated in furtherance of national fiscal policy, not operated for the profit of shareholders, do not provide ordinary commercial banking services, act as depositories for money held in the United States Treasury, hold the legal reserves and any remaining earnings are paid into the surplus fund where they may be used to supplement the gold reserve."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2433.079,2434.02,"Well, and--"
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.02,2435.793,--And most of those things seem absent here.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2435.793,2436.652,"--Well, I don't believe that's true."
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2443.367,2445.038,You mean there aren't private shareholders who get the money here?
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2445.038,2451.832,"There are farmers who own stock for which they receive no return, and if that stock is ever redeemed, which is at the discretion of the banks--"
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.832,2452.143,Yes.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2452.143,2452.794,--and the system--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.794,2453.124,Yes.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2453.124,2454.623,--they get what they paid in.
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.767,2461.579,"I see, so they don't get a profit."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2461.579,2462.57,--They don't get a profit.
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.425,2511.263,"Mr. Hanson, it took me a while, but the farm credit union example that you gave in answer to my earlier question, as I understand, that is entirely statutory."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2520.319,2521.02,--No.
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.332,2544.906,"Well, you recognize that you can be an instrumentality for one purpose but not for another?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2544.906,2548.388,"Well now, I don't believe that that's what this Court has ever said."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.141,2578.169,"Do you think there is a pattern in, say, federally chartered institutions for when Congress labels them Federal instrumentalities and when it doesn't, say the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts, and the Red Cross and the others?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2578.169,2582.102,"--Actually, the only pattern is that we're the only institutions that currently bear that designation."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2596.671,2608.559,"Well, perhaps it was a definition that came in originally when this... these associations were headed by a Federal administrator, and since the character of the--"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2608.559,2612.212,That designation changed--
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.212,2612.392,--association changed--
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2612.392,2613.063,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1996.95-1918,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2625.792,2629.024,"--You mean reaffirmed by some positive act, or just so they didn't change it?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2629.024,2643.944,"--The Farm Credit Act of 1971, which was a recodification of the entire act, said the production credit associations continued to be Federal instrumentalities, federally chartered instrumentalities of the United States, so it was an affirmative act in 1971."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.524,2785.327,"Of course, the Court could have said that in Department of Employment Security, and it didn't."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2785.327,2792.723,"Well, this Court is typically careful about deciding the case in front of it, and the case in front of it, United States had brought suit on behalf of an instrumentality."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.407,2819.12,It didn't reject your position.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2819.12,2820.172,--It did not.
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.172,2821.764,But it could have gone the way that would have supported it.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2821.764,2821.985,Yes.
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.823,2897.703,"You might try... I mean, I don't mean this necessarily seriously, but you could try a distinction between those agencies where there are strong reasons for independence of executive authority, the Fed, for example, maybe the FCC and a few other traditional independent ones, and those agencies where the proliferation of independent legal authority to control their own cases reflects nothing more than likely administrative convenience, and I don't know that that kind of distinction would work."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2903.577,2907.858,"--Well, I certainly agree that trying to write a bright line here--"
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.858,2924.891,"What about a rule that said Nash-Finch was the general Anti-Injunction Act and shouldn't be carried over to the Tax Injunction Act, so that neither Federal agencies nor Federal instrumentalities can get out of the Tax Injunction Act."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2929.344,2933.518,"--I appreciate that, so I'm not sure I'm prepared to advocate that argument."
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.183,2952.179,"The... what's difficult is Congress very often proliferates litigating authority for no reason other than the general counsel's office or the agency would like it, or there could be all kinds of reasons."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2952.179,2952.409,Right.
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.409,2959.895,"And it's unlikely Congress thought about this part when they did that, and of course the Fed's different."
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2962.557,2962.798,Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.798,2965.959,I don't know how it works across the banking agencies.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2966.347,2967.269,"--Well, in... but... you know... two points."
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2983.1,2983.911,--It would be nice to get--
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2989.887,2990.827,Sure.
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2991.218,2996.323,"And indeed, if you're going to get a refund of any taxes paid you're going to have to, aren't you?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,2996.323,2996.613,Right.
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2996.613,3006.647,"So what's the harm in saying, gee, this is the kind of situation where it ought to track the Eleventh Amendment situation, go to State court?"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3006.647,3008.27,"Well, I think--"
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3008.27,3014.943,And you always have the right to petition to this Court if you think the State courts have erred on the merits.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3014.943,3044.622,"--Well, I think the concern that I would have is that there is some taint associated with the fact that this type of entity, unless you go back... if you adopt a bright line rule of the United States has to be a party, and if you accept, as I certainly do as a practicing attorney that, given a Federal question of this type I'd want to be in Federal court, not State court, I mean, with no disrespect to the Arkansas courts, my preference, as the United States' would be, would be in Federal district court."
1996.95-1918,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3096.718,3102.742,Maybe it ought to be the same kind of a test we'd employ to see if there's some exception to the Eleventh Amendment.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3102.742,3114.059,"Well, and... I think that the test may be in part the same, though... though--"
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.059,3129.66,"That worries me, because I don't know about how many instances there are in borderline cases where you never have to reach the issue because Congress has said we give this the power to sue and be sued, and if we suddenly took an Eleventh Amendment test, I'd worry that all of a sudden we had to decide those things that otherwise never had to be decided--"
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3129.66,3129.89,--I--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.89,3130.519,--which are difficult.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3131.35,3131.52,--Well--
1996.95-1918,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3131.52,3132.311,I'm just putting that forward.
1996.95-1918,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,3132.311,3137.777,"--I believe I misspoke, though, because one difference between sovereign immunity is, of course, that's a constitutional protection given the State."
1996.95-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.163,3208.863,"Thank you, Mr. Hanson."
1996.95-1918,3,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,3210.905,3231.869,"First of all, regardless of test that the Court decides to apply, the respondents' arguments that they are entitled to first of all status under the Tax Injunction Act that would be the same as that of the United States is certainly not something that they have successfully been able to argue."
1996.95-1918,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3241.195,3246.41,What is your response to the Michigan case where he says the Government took just the opposite position in that case?
1996.95-1918,3,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,3246.41,3258.398,"--There is a specific statute, a specific taxation statute that relates to the Federal credit unions that gives them a very broad immunity from taxation."
1996.95-1918,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3276.471,3282.274,What would your position be if the statute here had not been amended and were the same as it had been?
1996.95-1918,3,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,3282.274,3287.139,"If the statute were the same, where the... well, first of all I need to answer that in two respects."
1996.95-1918,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.147,3469.139,"Thank you, Ms. Hunt."
1996.95-1918,3,36018,martha_grissom_hunt,,3469.139,3469.83,Thank you.
1996.95-1918,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3469.83,3471.263,The case is submitted.
