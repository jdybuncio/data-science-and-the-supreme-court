1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,37.053,42.327,May it please the Court.
1955.13_orig,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,371.38,376.714,Are there any relief for such a milk producer of Wisconsin?
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,376.714,384.529,"Apparently, there is no relief except to comply with the law or engage in the expensive litigation in that particular jurisdiction."
1955.13_orig,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,384.529,391.144,"Is it filed into the Commerce Clause, it would (Inaudible) that in light of this not to be in the penalty."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,391.144,395.883,"Mr. Justice, that is why we are in this Court."
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.759,553.083,This milk -- this milk were being processed or shipped?
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,553.083,558.59,It is required to be processed under the public health laws and --
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.59,561.674,Raw milk to the farm would not come under the Act.
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,561.674,568.242,"Raw milk would not come under this Act, and to properly move it, it has to be pasteurized."
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.242,573.645,"Yes, and it could be the processes that permits it."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,573.645,594.117,The law exempts the producer but imposes restraints which are unreasonable upon him because the individual producer doesn't have adequate volume or adequate finance to move milk in a volume necessary for economical transportation.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,594.117,598.469,And then -- then it will be the processors who'd affect (Inaudible)
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,598.469,611.798,"Well, our processors in Wisconsin are principally large cooperative farm organizations who gather the milk, process it and transport it or sell it outside of the state as well as within our jurisdiction."
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.798,617.292,That they could raise the problem in the Tennessee courts.
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,617.292,619.875,Individual litigants could go down there.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.875,621.619,Individual processors.
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,621.619,623.031,Individual processors could go down there.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,623.031,625.9,Even the -- in the sense of the farm cooperative.
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,625.9,627.568,That is correct.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,644.986,649.978,"Well, I -- I don't understand that because of what you said, the processors were the ones affected."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,649.978,652.967,"Well, it directly affects the farmer if the processor can't --"
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.967,654.85,Directly or indirectly?
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,654.85,654.949,It is through --
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,654.949,656.59,"Of course, didn't affect the price of milk."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,657.586,665.083,And it affects the producer if his processor can't move his milk.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.083,669.246,"Yes, indirectly."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,669.639,674.376,"We feel it's quite a direct affect because if the processor can't move it, the price --"
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,674.376,687.238,"Yes, but my -- I inquired directly to is the problem of the process raises the question of Tennessee and it has relation to Massachusetts versus Missouri."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,691.158,692.872,Illinois versus Missouri?
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,692.872,695.571,"No, Massachusetts against Missouri."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,722.613,724.188,"Well, we are relying --"
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.188,727.183,"Cook -- Cook against Oklahoma, are you relying on that?"
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,727.183,732.463,We're relying on Pennsylvania versus West Virginia.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,732.463,736.739,"Well, there -- there you have a proprietary matter."
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,736.739,743.764,The Court permitted the filing of the complaint under the doctrine of parens patriae as we understand it in that case.
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.764,747.393,"They -- they alleged that they were the owners of buildings, did they not?"
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,747.393,749.233,They alleged they were owner of buildings and schools --

1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,751.077,760.855,"And of course, we alleged that this has a direct impact on the tax revenues of the State of Wisconsin that our milk is not permitted to flow freely in interstate commerce."
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.855,777.614,But both -- both Georgia and -- and Georgia and also Pennsylvania alleged that they were actual sufferers from the precise Act over the tax.
1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,777.614,781.778,We also alleged that we suffer through the tax revenues and the depressed --
1955.13_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.778,782.485,But that's -- that's (Voice Overlap) --

1955.13_orig,0,43682,vernon_w_thomson,,790.166,808.179,"Well, in the case of Georgia versus the Pennsylvania Railroads, the Court said there that the proprietary allegation was more or less of a makeweight -- a makeweight argument and that they would permit the State to come into this Court under the doctrine of parens patriae."
1955.13_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,1666.612,1669.62,May it please the Court.

1955.13_orig,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2081.013,2083.692,And you think that is sufficiently particular?
1955.13_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2083.692,2087.014,I think it is not sufficiently particular.
1955.13_orig,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2093.715,2109.769,"You mean, there's -- how could you have in the state of the 28 of the millions (Inaudible) 59 million pounds of milk shipped, (Inaudible) in Tennessee where they said that."
