1967.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.772,"Number 21, Oswald Zschernig et al., appellants versus William J. Miller, Administrator et al."
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,22.758,27.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.372,271.336,As I recollect my understanding of the government to make this brief they say that as far as the government itself is concerned it’s not any greater power or have I misunderstood?
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,271.336,272.843,Your Honor read that correctly.
1967.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.374,294.242,"The government is on your side in the case I know, but not precisely for this reason here?"
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,294.242,326.049,"I claim Your Honor that whether it has actually to this point, if you can put your finger on whether it has adversely affected the foreign relations of the United States with the affected government, I am speaking now primarily of the iron curtain countries because this is a iron curtain country case, I will point out that our contention is that even though you may not have a demonstrable effect, you may not be able to pinpoint that alright we’ve had trouble with the Soviet Union because of the (Inaudible) case in 1961, but this not the issue."
1967.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,772.203,793.267,"May I ask you whether the statute in Oregon differs from some of the other statues in respect of the remedy that is to say does the New York Statute for example a deferral statute, a withholding statute, withholding the inheritance rather than one of escheat?"
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,793.267,794.428,That is correct.
1967.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,794.428,800.0,Is Oregon -- are there other states have escheat statutes rather than withholding a statute?
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,800.0,821.431,"There are about 10 statutes, they are listed in my brief, the states with which we are primarily concerned here, and I’ll say again Oregon is the most let’s say brutal statute, the most demanding statute because they not only require Reciprocity of inheritance, they not only require the immediate right of payment but they have this free use benefit control without confiscation."
1967.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,821.431,829.166,Apart from that [Inaudible] whether the other statutes are as escheat statutes are merely withholding or referral statutes?
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,829.166,853.336,"California’s is also an escheat statute but each of them California, Oregon, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina have provisions whereby if the non-resident alien do not inherit they escheat only if there is no eligible heir, if there is no other heir living outside the country, For instance if he has an relative in Great Britain or if he had a relative in this country, in Canada, Australia, wherever it is."
1967.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,853.336,855.355,What about New York for example?
1967.21,0,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,855.355,858.716,There is no escheat provision in the New York statute.
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,1475.632,1480.394,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1694.749,1703.203,We’ll recess now.[Recess]
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,1703.203,1708.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.555,1997.089,That may be so if United States claims otherwise?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,1997.089,2018.837,"Yes, Your Honor however as this Court stated in Kolovrat versus Oregon regardless of the fact of the position of the Federal government and the agency given the power to negotiate and implement these treaties and recognize in a great way that must be given to this position and to the position taken by the government, the Court will still interpret the treaties for itself."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.837,2020.448,What if you loose on all this?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2027.272,2030.591,"No, Your Honor I’m not reluctant to take a position I think --"
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.591,2033.312,You think the cases have settled it --
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2033.312,2046.847,"I think the cases have settled it and if it goes the other way, if the treaty is interpreted as by this Court, reinterpreted as applying to personal property as well as real property in Article 4 of 1923 than this will cover this case."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.847,2060.491,"Well they do -- does the State of Oregon have any suggestion as the why the people of that treaty would limit the inheritability of personal property through that property that is located in the, in another country?"
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2060.491,2065.971,"No, Your Honor I have -- the court did not consider it, neither of the courts in Oregon."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.971,2074.893,"They just rely on the language, you say your language, that’s what the language says and even though that doesn’t make much sense --"
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2074.893,2075.739,That’s correct Your Honor.
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.922,2097.999,"Do you know what the common law rule or in absent of treaty or in the absence, what was the rule in Oregon the before – this 1937 statute?"
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2097.999,2108.138,"No, Your Honor the 1937 statute was the one previously referred to by Mr. Schwabe, the OCLA statute 61107 that was the statute in Oregon in 1937."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.138,2109.268,When was that?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2109.268,2110.446,That was in 1937.
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.446,2111.656,That’s what I mean.
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2111.656,2117.197,We are not dealing with that statute today though we are dealing with ORS 111070 which was passed in 1951.
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.197,2121.098,Alright but what was the rule in Oregon on 1937?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2121.098,2123.764,"Your Honor, I’m sorry -- on that point, couldn’t say."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.764,2142.326,"Well absent, wasn’t the old rule, the absent of treaty, absent of treaty or absent of statute or let say absent of statute is that a normal state rule or the inheritability of personal property and the non-inheritability of real estate, isn’t that true?"
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2142.326,2144.877,"As far as aliens are concerned yes, Your Honor."
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.495,2147.467,Absent the statute?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2147.467,2147.941,Absent the statute.
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.941,2155.73,"Absent the statute, the non-resident alien could have inherited this personally?"
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2155.73,2157.026,I believe that is correct Your Honor.
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.865,2190.075,Why wouldn’t the people that engrafted a treaty assume the existence of the inheritability of person located in this country?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2190.075,2191.951,"I believe they should have assumed it Your Honor, I believe --"
1967.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.951,2200.042,"Well yeah, well they assumed it all right and their only problem was that person is located elsewhere."
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2202.161,2209.602,Their problem was person had located elsewhere or the possible interpretation of an ambiguous statement in the treaty.
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2469.483,2486.564,What's not clear to me is what would happen if a resident and citizen of Leipzig should die leaving heirs out in (Inaudible) what would happen?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2486.564,2487.269,Your Honor I would --
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.269,2489.037,If that’s a real and personal property?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2489.037,2512.569,"As to real and personal property unless the treaty of 1923 with Germany could be carried into effect and its reciprocity provisions there, with the non-recognition of East Germany, I don’t see how anything would happen except that the property would remain in Leipzig and that the -–"
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.569,2514.06,[Inaudible]
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2514.06,2515.753,"To East Germany, Your Honor?"
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2515.753,2517.441,Yes.
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2517.441,2518.598,I have no idea.
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2518.598,2521.158,It’s something I would think that would happen?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2521.158,2526.948,"Well it would happen under, it would happen under East German law, Your Honor, and about this, there’s nothing in the record."
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2540.442,2543.559,And the record --
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2543.559,2544.812,The record has no bearing here.
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2581.697,2583.587,Now weren't you just talking about West Germany?
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2583.587,2585.232,"I was talking of West Germany, yes, Your Honor."
1967.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2585.232,2586.819,That part is controlled by the Bonn government.
1967.21,1,46428,wayne_m_thompson,,2586.819,2594.129,"Yes, Your Honor, the Federal Republic of Germany."
1967.21,2,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,2914.001,2916.046,Mr. Chief Justice if the Court please.
1967.21,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3180.484,3188.728,"But you still say you're not relying on the 1954 Treaty, but rather on the point with respect to constitutionality?"
1967.21,2,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,3188.728,3194.105,"Yes Your Honor, because we did not appeal on that subject and it think I gave Your Honor the reason for that."
1967.21,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3224.074,3241.586,"Well there's a little offering that’s here, it seems to me because we have a brief from the Attorney General of the United States in which he argues a treaty point and you say you don’t rely on it."
1967.21,2,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,3261.844,3263.858,Are you speaking of the Attorney General of Oregon or the --
1967.21,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3263.858,3266.751,The United States.
1967.21,2,38366,peter_a_schwabe_sr,,3266.751,3273.201,"We take the position Your Honor that we did not respond to his brief for the reason that, that was brought in on his own volition."
