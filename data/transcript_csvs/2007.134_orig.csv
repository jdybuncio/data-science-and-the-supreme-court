2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.542,"We'll hear argument next in case 134 on our original docket, New Jersey v. Delaware."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,13.664,33.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although the 1905 Compact between Delaware and New Jersey did not settle the boundary dispute between them, New Jersey nevertheless agreed to dismiss the suit that it had filed before this Court to determine the boundary."
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,116.28,154.826,"Mr. Farr, one of the striking things about this Compact is that to the extent that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail about service arrests on the river and about fishing, but then you get to these two articles at the end and they certainly don't have that same definite detailed quality."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,181.705,184.501,"Well, several things about that, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.172,230.699,"Was it clear that New Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to New Jersey's environmental laws?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,230.699,232.574,No.
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.9,236.54,The history doesn't show anything about that?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,236.54,238.728,--The history doesn't show anything--
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.728,239.867,So if--
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,239.867,241.633,--specific about that kind of law.
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.633,262.449,"--if it... if it would have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws, had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the river."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,262.449,278.132,"I think without the Compact that would be true, but I think what the Compact is saying is that you get to retain the degree of power on your own side of the river that you had before, without regard ultimately to where the boundary is determined to be."
2007.134_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,278.132,301.263,"So your... your argument... it seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument is assuming that by virtue of the ""may continue"" language, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power, and the new power in effect is to... is to make grants of subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but to Delaware, and that's the stretch."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,322.49,330.238,"Well, Justice Souter, I think that the difficulty with that question is it assumes knowledge of where the boundary is."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.057,345.777,I don't--
2007.134_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,345.777,375.796,"No, I'm simply saying that your position... and I accept your position... that the Compact is intended to continue to operate whether or not the boundary is... is ultimately determined, and if so, after it is ultimately determined... and once we get to that point of continuing to operate after, then necessarily the only way it can operate on your theory is to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,406.454,407.565,"Well, of course."
2007.134_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,417.263,420.262,"Well, if you emphasize ""under its laws"", then don't you lose?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,430.728,436.363,"Well, I don't think that the laws have to refer specifically, obviously, to granting Delaware land."
2007.134_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,445.316,452.078,"But I'm going on the assumption that it, in fact, had jurisdiction; that it had land below... beyond the low-water mark."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,452.078,469.805,"--But what I think you're suggesting, Justice Souter, I think, is what... what fundamentally alters the nature of the Compact is to assume that New Jersey had certain powers up until the time the boundary line was determined, and then it lost those powers after the boundary line was--"
2007.134_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.805,475.755,It didn't so much lose... I mean it had a generalized recognition of power.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,509.366,511.913,"--You see, I think there are two problems with that, Justice Souter."
2007.134_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,553.521,554.238,What right do you think--
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,554.238,555.598,I--
2007.134_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,555.598,559.611,--What right do you think New Jersey has now with respect to the subaqueous land?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,567.921,571.45,"--Basically, I think what you have said, Justice Alito, is exactly right."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.98,572.994,--I have a more basic question.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,590.363,593.486,"--It depends on the form of the grant, but, typically, if New Jersey--"
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.486,596.8,"But, normally, authority to wharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,596.8,601.952,--It conveys an interest in the land that allows the doing of the activity--
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.952,603.0,Of the wharf.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,603.0,603.531,--for which the--
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.531,603.936,Of the wharf.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,603.936,604.654,--That's correct.
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.654,621.211,"Now, if... if merely authority to wharf out would not even convey New Jersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of this Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now Delaware's land?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,621.211,627.942,"Well, because Delaware has essentially said in Article VII, we believe, Justice Scalia, that New Jersey may continue to do this."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.787,636.641,"May continue to wharf out, but not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say doesn't go with wharfing out."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,636.641,647.042,"--Well, what we are... what we're talking about, I think, is we're talking about granting the interest in land that is necessary for the riparian owner to be able to wharf out."
2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,647.042,659.399,"So that if you have one of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark and there are two people at the end of it and one of them shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for murder in Delaware or New Jersey?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,659.399,677.5,"Well, in... in... there was a gambling offense at the end of a pier in... in... that proceeded from the New Jersey shoreline, in 19... in the late 1950's in a case called the Federenco case, which I don't have the cite for immediately."
2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.714,686.31,I suspect the New Jersey Supreme Court would.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,686.31,690.526,"--Delaware filed a brief, Mr. Chief Justice, supporting that position."
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.271,746.596,"Mr. Farr, what about the article that follows Article VII?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,765.466,772.15,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I may say, the quote is longer than that and in a critically important way."
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,776.852,787.986,"Yes, and I don't see anything expressly set forth in VII, which just says ""may continue to"", which says the status quo is maintained."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,787.986,797.544,"Well, I mean, obviously, we're... we're debating the meaning of Article VII, but it seems to me that Article VII is an express provision herein, meaning in the Compact."
2007.134_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.212,856.566,"Well, are you asking us to reject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all circumstances?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,856.566,870.515,"As far as State jurisdiction goes, it seems to me there is not concurrent jurisdiction over riparian structures such as piers and wharves and other kinds of acknowledged riparian rights."
2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,886.791,887.322,How do we split that difference?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,887.868,888.492,--Pardon me?
2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,888.492,892.102,"--I mean, how do we decide the difference between those two cases?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,905.767,912.969,"But I think what you've done, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, is I think you've detached the purpose of a wharf from the wharf itself."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.118,929.803,Could New Jersey... could New Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,929.803,931.616,"Under State law, yes, it could, Your Honor."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.616,935.754,Well... but New Jersey had given this riparian owner the right to wharf out.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,935.754,937.332,Well--
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.332,947.64,"So, obviously, the right to wharf out does not include the right to use the wharf for whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing about is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can impose limitations."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,951.999,952.888,--I agree with that.
2007.134_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.177,1015.113,"And in your view to what extent does this involve subaqueous lands toward... and I'll just put ""toward""... the New Jersey side?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1015.113,1020.174,"Unfortunately, I'm not sure I understand the phrase ""toward the New Jersey side""."
2007.134_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1023.984,1030.714,I'm not sure I understand your position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins and ends with reference to subaqueous lands.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1030.714,1042.616,"--Well, it's... literal ownership of the land begins at the high-water mark on the New Jersey side and ends at the low-water mark on the New Jersey side, its actual ownership."
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.761,1067.697,That suggests--
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1067.697,1068.352,If they were--
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.352,1072.494,--it's still an extraordinary power for one State to give up.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1087.613,1109.024,"--Well, again, the question that you're asking assumes that the negotiators were coming into the negotiation with their boundary positions fixed and that they were essentially horse-trading within the bounds of the different positions taken by the two States."
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.024,1109.773,"No, I'm not assuming that."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1115.054,1115.522,There's the possibility that--
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.522,1116.508,--end up--
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1116.508,1116.929,--I'm sorry.
2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.929,1121.909,--There's a possibility that it will end up on the Delaware side.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1132.094,1138.155,That is what I'm suggesting with respect to this narrow category of riparian rights.
2007.134_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.356,1180.574,But that's... Article I... that's an exception.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1185.588,1186.618,--The exception--
2007.134_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1186.618,1191.367,The exception is not that specific as to the... as to the extent of the jurisdiction.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1191.367,1233.21,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I think you've asked a very good question, but... but I guess I think it is... it's quite specific, because the question is, what do the terms"
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.996,1263.01,"Mr. Farr, is there--"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1263.01,1263.431,--regardless of where--
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.431,1266.383,--Is there a limit on New Jersey's rights?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1278.612,1283.518,"--Well, there are two questions there, Justice Stevens, if I can separate them for a moment."
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.621,1294.451,"Well, then I should--"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1294.451,1294.919,--on a wharf.
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.919,1295.559,--I should rephrase it.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1304.196,1310.849,"Under State... by applying Delaware State law, I think it cannot impose any limits."
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.849,1311.941,Any limit whatsoever?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1311.941,1315.723,With respect to the exercise of riparian rights.
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.472,1321.643,Even if... even if the building of the wharf interfered with the navigation on the river?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1321.643,1324.735,"--Well, this is, I think, why I was trying to separate it into two parts."
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.448,1337.244,"Well, I'm just asking, is it--"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1337.244,1337.618,--in any State.
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.618,1344.381,--does Delaware law place any limit on what New Jersey may do in exercising its riparian rights?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1344.381,1349.833,"I mean, it does impose a limit, but we don't think those limits are valid under Article VII of the Compact."
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.535,1351.802,"I mean, can they validly impose a limit?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1351.802,1353.393,"--No, no, they cannot."

2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1394.018,1396.642,"No, I would say it does have a right there because that is not a--"
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.642,1398.159,That's not a riparian use.
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1398.159,1398.986,--That's not a riparian use.
2007.134_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.156,1404.266,Anything involving loading and unloading of ships and so forth would be permissible?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1404.266,1405.265,--Exactly.
2007.134_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.265,1408.965,Then how come your position in my murder hypothetical was what it was?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1417.898,1426.395,"Because I think we're talking about now what happens with respect... I mean, if we're talking... this was a gambling... it wasn't a casino."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.599,1471.598,"Mr. Farr, could you tell me... one thing in Article VII perplexes me."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1487.668,1488.308,I assume--
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.308,1492.371,"I mean, obviously each State can... riparian lands are within each State."
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1494.57,1502.553,"--Well, I think the fact is that this is why one needs to give some sort of practical... take a practical view of what Article VII is talking about."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.408,1553.891,"So you say ""riparian lands"" means the land under the wharf?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1555.638,1561.105,"--No, that's what... I mean, ""riparian lands"" could mean the lands on the bank, but I think that's not what they're talking about in this context."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.105,1566.524,Do you know of any other instance where people talk of riparian lands and they mean land extending under the water?
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1566.524,1576.834,"I think, because of the context here, when it's linked with the rights, that the necessary... the limitation that Justice Alito mentioned gives... colors it essentially to say this is what we're talking about."
2007.134_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.035,1580.987,"That's your position, that ""lands"" means the lands under the water?"
2007.134_orig,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1580.987,1590.671,"--That's correct, because this is settling... 1 the point of it is to settle and avoid future controversy with respect to the river, and those are the lands that are under the river."

2007.134_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.69,1628.282,I thought this extended out more than any prior exercise of riparian rights.

2007.134_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1702.734,1704.625,"Well, then boundries don't matter completely."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1704.625,1750.546,"--No, they can... under Delaware law, a riparian owner in New Jersey can extend past the low-water mark as has been permitted by New Jersey, by Delaware in every single instance since 1961 when Delaware enacted subaqueous land laws, except the two times where New Jersey riparian owners sought to violate Delaware's laws by building LNG facilities: In 1972 when the El Paso Company sought to build an LNG facility and was denied by Delaware and New Jersey acquiesced in that denial, and then in 2005 when Delaware made the status determination that the Crown Landing facility was a prohibited bulk transfer facility precluded by Delaware law."

2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1777.332,1777.893,--Yes.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1777.893,1779.235,Is the statute effective?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1779.235,1782.358,The statute is not effected in the hypothetical that you give.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.919,1789.265,I'm talking about a new statute.

2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1820.277,1821.591,--It depends.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.058,1823.592,It depends on what?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1823.592,1826.559,The Constitution of the United States and the constitution of Delaware.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.48,1830.4,Forget the Federal right now.

2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1867.871,1868.463,--No.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.463,1869.103,--in your view?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1869.103,1876.941,I don't think that Delaware would prevail on a blanket prohibition of the exercise of riparian rights by New Jersey landowners.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1876.941,1877.472,Why?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1877.472,1882.643,Because Delaware has always permitted the exercise of riparian rights because--
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1882.643,1887.86,"Well, that is before there was all these wharves were out here, and Delaware is now saying the facts have changed."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1887.86,1896.263,"--Delaware certainly has the power, under our theory of the case as recommended by the Special Master, to implement its police powers."
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1913.382,1916.833,It seems to me you're running away from the hypothetical.

2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.628,1997.222,"But again, you're changing the hypothetical."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2032.395,2036.267,"That becomes a dormant Commerce Clause problem, Justice Souter."
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.267,2038.922,He is asking about under this thing.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2072.735,2085.748,"Justice Scalia, under a broad theory of where the boundary is in matters, it would require New Jersey to have access to grant Delaware lands."
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2094.806,2097.384,I think you're eliminating the right to wharf out.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2102.644,2110.564,"--There were only two proven in the record, Justice Alito, and neither of which was proved in this record to go beyond the low-water mark."
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.752,2114.815,It was a wharf that didn't go beyond a low-water mark?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2114.815,2115.361,Yes.
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.89,2118.142,"What did they do, jump onto the land?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2118.578,2119.436,--No.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2141.818,2147.114,Isn't it true... we can look and see what was authorized or not before 1905.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2154.454,2155.109,--Certainly.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2155.109,2156.204,--under U.S. law?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2156.204,2157.093,Certainly.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2157.093,2172.306,"And in deciding whether to allow someone to wharf out, the State with jurisdiction would decide whether the wharf was consistent with State objectives, safety objectives, interference with navigation and so forth?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2172.306,2173.714,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2173.714,2184.581,And Article VII says that each State on its own side of the river may continue to make conveyances of riparian rights.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2198.639,2217.256,"The last part of your question, Justice Alito, is where the rub lies, because riparian law was subject to the individual determination of what a riparian right was, and how the State's regulation of that right as a private property right would be determined."
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2227.113,2230.407,"If you separate these two, then the riparian right is worthless, is it not?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2230.407,2231.328,I beg your pardon?
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.328,2233.531,It's worthless if you separate those two.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2233.531,2234.155,No.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2234.155,2244.98,"If you say, New Jersey can authorize wharfing out, except Delaware can say you can't wharf out, because it's inconsistent with our police power, then... then the authorization to allow wharfing out is meaningless."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2244.98,2260.459,"No, because wharfing out is always dependent on whether or not it is so far into the river to impede the navigable channel, to become a nuisance, and none of the cases by this Court talking about wharfing rights concern the police powers issued by the State."
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2276.983,2279.967,But that assumes that there is going to be a wharf.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2285.82,2286.338,--No.
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.338,2288.226,And that seems to me inconsistent.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2289.369,2290.102,Justice--
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.102,2294.317,That seems to me inconsistent with saying that New Jersey has a right to wharf out.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2294.317,2296.614,"--We are not going that far, Justice Kennedy."
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2297.581,2301.52,"I don't know where... what... where do you draw the line, what is your distinction?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2301.52,2307.673,--A wharf that impedes navigation is a nuisance that is subject to classic police power restrictions.
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.527,2325.946,So a wharf that is just ugly is okay.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2330.93,2338.99,"Delaware cannot say no more wharfs, but that doesn't answer the question that's really at the rub of this case, which is what you do on the wharf."
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.99,2350.061,So we here decide... under your view the case comes down to whether or not use of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is a traditional riparian right.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2350.061,2352.794,And all of the law and evidence suggests that it is not.
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.714,2367.585,"So let's say Delaware, it's not liquified natural, gas but it's, you know, bulk shipments."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2374.491,2375.895,--Delaware has permitted that.
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2382.533,2389.687,Under your view a riparian right exists only to say whether there should be a wharf.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2397.51,2398.84,They are distinctive rights.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2408.164,2414.8,"Well, what's the point you just made that Delaware can't prohibit a coal wharf but it cannot prohibit a liquified natural gas wharf?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2414.8,2418.127,Delaware's Subaqueous Lands Act makes that distinction.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2418.127,2418.77,"No, but--"

2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.782,2423.594,--not what Delaware will do or did do.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2425.001,2426.452,--Delaware has to--
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2426.452,2429.528,Could Delaware prohibit a coal wharf?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2429.528,2430.293,--It... yes.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.477,2438.415,"Well, that's the question."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2438.415,2446.912,"And the answer, Justice Souter, is not decided by the facts on the case here but rather on the individual circumstances."
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2449.584,2455.659,"Then your answer to Justice Alito is, tell me more about the circumstances and I will then give you an answer."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2455.659,2457.593,--Indeed.
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.45,2463.856,No.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2467.405,2476.682,"The Compact does not contain the constraints, the Attorney General of New Jersey recognized it, and this is at the appendix starting at 905 of the Delaware appendix."

2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.573,2911.182,Excuse me.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2915.946,2916.804,Yes.
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.804,2918.368,"Well, then that's no basis for distinguishing."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2919.445,2926.648,The Black-Jenkins award issued to resolve the boundary line was decided in 1877.
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2959.57,2960.631,That's the case here as well.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2967.549,2972.611,"--The doubt here, Mr. Chief Justice, is what the phrase ""own side"" means."
2007.134_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3023.23,3030.619,I don't understand the difference between withdrawing water as not being subject to the police powers.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3032.788,3046.253,"Well, what the court held and what was decided in that case was that the taking of the water by Virginia was not to the level where it would give rise to the kind of police concern that Maryland might express."
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3048.908,3049.891,I don't understand that.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3057.686,3063.34,"It would be a valid exercise, but I was answering Mr. Chief Justice's question about what is left of it."
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3073.366,3083.599,As I understand our decision in Virginia v. Maryland it's that withdrawing of the water is a carve out of Maryland's police power that would otherwise apply.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3083.599,3088.578,"--It would... it would be a limited carve out, that is correct."
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3088.578,3089.455,Right.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3102.042,3106.714,"It is a limited carve out to the extent of permitting the wharfing out, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.166,3108.539,You don't even acknowledge that.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3117.879,3122.223,--If it is a nuisance you cannot get a license.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3124.676,3128.081,"Well, I understood your earlier answer to be exactly what Justice Scalia said."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3133.641,3135.201,--I'm saying yes.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3137.794,3142.153,I'm not saying whether that would be a classic exercise.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3169.345,3172.247,--Let me try it this way.
2007.134_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3191.49,3192.051,I don't.
2007.134_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.051,3192.722,Wait.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3197.816,3198.284,--No.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3205.517,3211.202,"And it can limit it, I presume, subject to some reasonable rule of health and safety?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3211.202,3212.091,That's correct.
2007.134_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.091,3212.762,Okay.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3217.902,3218.791,That's correct.
2007.134_orig,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3218.791,3220.308,Who decides whether it's a nuisance?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3229.835,3240.519,Typically the Corps of Engineers determines that issue as a matter of application of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act.
2007.134_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3255.166,3256.308,But you're not talking about nuisance.
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3263.101,3264.836,--That's correct.
2007.134_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3264.836,3274.643,And you were saying Delaware's environmental laws trump whatever riparian right New Jersey can grant?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3274.643,3280.313,The environmental laws would apply to the project.
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3294.449,3303.836,"Could the State of New Jersey allow the wharf to be built for some unspecified purpose, just let it stick out there until it decides what it wants to do with it?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3303.836,3308.32,"As I matter of both States' laws, Justice Kennedy, that's not how either state does it."
2007.134_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.223,3314.442,"I'm asking a hypothetical, could it do that?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3318.003,3330.528,"--I think that, yes, it could do that if its intent was to achieve access to the navigable waterway."
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3341.134,3342.554,How does that work?
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3360.141,3369.636,"--That is an easy one, Mr. Chief Justice, because New Jersey has conceded that it does not have the authority to regulate dredging within the Twelve Mile Circle."
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.636,3371.277,"Well, it's something they do have the authority to regulate."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3371.277,3372.151,That's the point.
2007.134_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3389.909,3393.267,"You used the word ""riparian jurisdiction""."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3403.624,3405.668,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.134_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.629,3430.285,"Mr. Frederick, does the riparian right include the right to dump refuse or sewage into a river?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3430.285,3437.983,"--It is a... yes, it is a part of the classic riparian right, intakes and discharges, Justice Stevens."
2007.134_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3437.983,3441.688,"And even though that would create a nuisance across the river, you could... they still would have... who would trump?"
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3442.374,3450.45,"The police power would prevail on that, because what you dump is what... is where everything matters."
2007.134_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.789,3457.055,"No, I'm assuming something that pollutes the river."
2007.134_orig,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3457.055,3461.223,--That would be subject to the environmental laws.
2007.134_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3466.223,3467.72,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3470.786,3473.048,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.134_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3581.613,3582.83,It's a one-way pass.
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3584.456,3585.174,Well--
2007.134_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3585.174,3587.954,It doesn't give Delaware anything.
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3587.954,3608.415,"--Well, except for the fact that, again, if we put ourselves in their shoes, it seems to me what New Jersey would say is: If you are proposing that you can veto all of our riparian projects using your police power because of your view of the boundary, why are we dismissing the case that we just filed, or filed in 1877--"
2007.134_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3608.415,3608.93,You are saying that the--
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3608.93,3609.632,--to determine the boundaries?
2007.134_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3609.632,3615.271,"--You are saying that the concept of ""riparian rights"" displaces the police power, to a large extent."
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3615.271,3630.294,"To the extent that the exercise of the police power is inconsistent with the power of the State, the authority of the State, to authorize a pier or wharf for the purposes for which piers and wharves are used, which is the loading and unloading of goods."
2007.134_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3647.695,3650.023,"Mr. Farr, can I ask you a question as purely a--"
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3650.023,3650.678,Of course.
2007.134_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3650.678,3651.134,--matter of curiosity?
2007.134_orig,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3665.518,3670.468,"Oh, there were... I think there were further grants along the process and further division of... of territory."
2007.134_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3678.274,3679.152,--Thank you.
