1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.087,"We will hear argument next in Number 86-1845, Jose Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Company, et al.--"
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,64.434,113.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am frank to say to the Court at the outset that I am here today with mixed emotions, thrilled, of course, after some 35 years of practice to have at least the opportunity to appear at our judicial summit, but saddened, too, at least chagrined by the irony that this certainly for me the most memorable appearance in my career should be basically traceable to a lapse in my office marking one of the low points of my career, perhaps, the very xx of it, or close to it."
1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.997,223.017,"Well, Mr. Yturbide, supposing that instead of reversing the dismissal the Court of Appeals had affirmed the dismissal, and the appellees had sought sanctions against those who appealed."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,229.691,235.956,"Oh, the sanctions were very realistically in the picture before the appeal ever came into it."
1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.859,275.653,He didn't expose himself to any possible sanctions as a result of his appeal--
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,275.653,275.943,No.
1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.943,277.934,--because he wasn't named as a party.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,277.934,285.35,But I think on balance that that would hardly have been a serious matter.
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.416,357.29,"Mr. Yturbide, suppose the same thing had happened, the same clerical error in omitting the name of one of the plaintiffs at the complaint stage, and you could show the same thing as here, that this individual was really meant to be included, and it was purely a clerical error that he was not included."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,357.29,363.302,I believe that the matter would be somewhat different.
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.734,413.697,But the Court of Appeals has separate jurisdictional requirements.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,426.076,455.745,"Well, of course, that's the theory, and that is part of the reason, I suppose, that we are here all together today, is to see whether or not that is or is not a jurisdictional act in this kind of context where at least you have someone who has instituted the notice of appeal with reference to the subject matter that is of common interest to all of those who were similarly situated, here identically situated below."
1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.496,489.678,"Yes, but you weren't petitioning for certiorari, Mr. Yturbide."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,495.552,501.696,"Well, 10.4 is an appellate rule, Your Honor, as 19.6 is the certiorari one."
1987.86-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.199,593.809,"There is no provision, Mr. Yturbide, I take it in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to permit a motion to amend the notice of appeal?"
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,593.809,598.87,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.86-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,598.87,606.764,I take it there is no provision in the appellate rules for amending a notice of appeal.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,606.764,612.028,There is no specific one.
1987.86-1845,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.123,667.637,"Well, did you comply with that here, Mr. Yturbide?"
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,667.637,668.875,Certainly not.
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.16,719.781,Why did you think they called attention to it in the footnote?
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,720.452,723.163,"--In the footnote, why they called attention to it?"
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.163,726.566,--If they didn't intend to rely upon it for anything.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,734.21,755.625,"Well, certainly they had some obligation if they had an intention to be open about the matter and come forthrightly out with the notion that in their view there was a violation of some rule that he was no longer a party interested in the appeal."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.458,824.351,May I ask you a suggestion about the proceeding?
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,830.164,833.436,When was the class certified?
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.436,833.717,Yes.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,833.717,852.489,"I believe within about... my recollection is correct, about four or five months, in February of 1986, I think, something of that kind, which was some time four or five months after the entry of the present summary judgment against Mr. Torres."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.489,857.763,"So at the time the summary judgment against him was entered, the class had not yet been certified."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,857.763,858.373,That's correct.
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.373,861.015,How big is the class?
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,861.015,894.948,"The class is assumed to be, I don't think that that has been precisely established, but I think it is generally assumed to be as now redefined in the liability opinion that the trial court has come out with and which we have lodged now with the court... it was decided a couple of months ago in favor of liability on a broad front and covering a 15-year period... probably encompasses something in the hundreds, 300, 400."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.948,895.639,I see.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,899.312,900.744,I am sorry?
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.744,903.168,--Are the members of the class former employees?
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,904.828,904.978,Yes.
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.978,905.889,Of the respondent.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,906.129,912.864,"All of them employees, all of the named intervenors, including Mr. Torres, certainly come within the class."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.612,948.057,And has the District Court decided that if relief is given to the class there will be no relief given to Torres?
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,948.057,948.457,No.
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.457,950.54,That is still a question that is open.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,950.54,958.304,"Well, it was decided that he will not participate as a named intervenor."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.304,958.785,He is not--
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,958.785,971.682,"He is out as a named intervenor, has reserved decision, which in itself is somewhat menacing, reserved decision as to whether he may participate as an absent class member."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.682,976.046,"--But it is conceivable, is it not, that... assume we agree with your opponent."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,981.119,998.39,"Only in this sense, that it is conceivable that he may after running another gauntlet get to the point of equality with absent class members."
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.046,1029.09,"Yes, but they are on the firing line because they risk liability for costs, is one of the reasons, and I gather your client didn't risk that liability on the appeal."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1029.09,1034.855,"--Well, I don't think there's any real--"
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.855,1041.039,"I mean, normally I thought named plaintiff not the same thing as the members--"
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1041.039,1044.92,--I think there is some... I don't know what is normal or what isn't.
1987.86-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.262,1102.608,"--You are arguing that an unnamed plaintiff should get the special consideration of the named plaintiff, in effect, or an unnamed appellant, rather."
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1104.218,1134.098,"I am suggesting that there is an important difference between whether you remain in a case as a named plaintiff or whether even if you are so lucky as to convince the judge that you are entitled to that latter stage or remain in the case only in the same level of participation as an absent class member, there is such a--"
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.098,1139.511,There were no absent class members who were in the case at the time of this appeal because the class--
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1139.511,1144.226,"--Potentially there were, certainly their interests were represented."
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.226,1145.425,--To say potentially there were is to say there were not.
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1150.701,1163.04,"Oh, I think that there is authority for the proposition that even in the absence of certification there is representative effect to what potential representatives do."
1987.86-1845,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.11,1223.903,"Well, does it prove that they are representative, or doesn't prove than when you are certified as a class you take the case in the status in which it exists, you come into it given all of its frailties and weaknesses, including whatever has been established by a prior appeal before you came in?"
1987.86-1845,0,18180,bv_yturbide,,1223.903,1231.747,I suppose that there are... that that is another of those areas where characterization can seemingly make a difference.
1987.86-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.943,1635.375,"Thank you, Mr. Yturbide."
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,1637.756,1655.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the one irreducible fact in this case is that Jose Torres did not file a notice of appeal from the 1981 dismissal of this action."
1987.86-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.815,2071.223,Does Rule 2 possibly encompass some authority to suspend any of the rules for good cause shown?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2071.223,2094.559,"Rule 26 would seem to speak to that explicitly, Justice O'Connor, and it would seem that where there is a direct statement limiting the Court's authority in Rule 26, that a broader authority should not be presumed by general language found elsewhere in the rules."
1987.86-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.559,2110.108,Would your position be the same if the request to amend the notice had been filed earlier in this case?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2110.108,2119.544,"If the request to amend the notice had been filed within the 40-day time period, that is, between 30 and 60 days."
1987.86-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.544,2120.625,How about beyond the 60 days?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2124.099,2124.639,"Yes, it would."
1987.86-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.365,2587.778,"Mr. McKae, I remember in law school from time to time I would see cases named one of the spouses and it would say ""et ux""."
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2593.094,2595.595,--I am afraid my Latin isn't... strong enough to--
1987.86-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.595,2598.537,"I think it means ""and spouse""."
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2598.537,2606.942,"--No, I don't think that would under the rule, but clearly ""et al"" does not even mean ""and all others""."
1987.86-1845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.985,2634.302,Isn't the whole purpose to assess costs as to who is going to be responsible for the costs?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2634.302,2637.644,"Well, the whole purpose is to determine who is before the Court."
1987.86-1845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.644,2638.674,That's what I mean.
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2638.674,2642.938,That would include assessing costs from the appellant's standpoint.
1987.86-1845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.77,2753.633,"Well, do you think he stands as though the District Court was never reversed?"
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2753.633,2756.305,--I believe he does.
1987.86-1845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.996,2758.538,You mean subject to sanctions?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2758.538,2762.76,He could be subject to sanctions.
1987.86-1845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.202,2768.454,Even though the trial court has been reversed?
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2768.454,2774.067,--I think that that would be a consideration on the part of the court in determining whether to award sanctions.
1987.86-1845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.582,2780.631,"Liable for attorneys' fees, just as though there had never been an appeal?"
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2780.631,2792.06,"Well, I think that's the question as to whether he is liable for attorneys' fees with respect to his own counsel, but certainly Oakland Scavenger Company would have been entitled to make the motion."
1987.86-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.736,2800.167,"That really isn't before us here, is it?"
1987.86-1845,1,41629,stephen_mc_kae,,2800.167,2801.136,"That really isn't, no."
1987.86-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.304,2813.054,"Thank you, Mr. McKae."
1987.86-1845,2,18180,bv_yturbide,,2815.788,2817.357,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3079.646,3086.141,"Yes, but in order to do that they would have had to depart from the law of the Ninth Circuit because there was a precedent in your circuit, was there not?"
1987.86-1845,2,18180,bv_yturbide,,3086.141,3091.246,--There was some law in the Ninth Circuit that touched that specific--
1987.86-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.246,3091.984,I think there was a--
1987.86-1845,2,18180,bv_yturbide,,3091.984,3096.299,"--matter completely at odds, completely at odds, Your Honor, with--"
1987.86-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.299,3097.17,--Cases--
1987.86-1845,2,18180,bv_yturbide,,3097.17,3108.937,"--other cases in the Ninth Circuit if I may say so, which do relax appellate rules without making them jurisdictional, including, I might say--"
1987.86-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.937,3113.68,--I thought there was a case in 1950 in the Ninth Circuit that was right on the nose.
1987.86-1845,2,18180,bv_yturbide,,3114.451,3123.968,"--Yes, I have no doubt that Cook against... Cook and Sons is a case pointing in that direction as well, and others."
1987.86-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.968,3128.469,"Mr. Yturbide, your time has expired."
