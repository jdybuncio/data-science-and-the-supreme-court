1962.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.104,"Number 52, Raymond R. Best, et al., Petitioner, versus Humboldt Placer Mining Company, et al."
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,41.213,45.6,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.
1962.52,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,197.58,235.661,"Well, Mr. Marquis, what is significant to the fact that according to the respondent's brief here, that it's perfectly acceptable (Inaudible)"
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,235.661,245.315,"Well, I think it was put in the complaint simply -- so that it would not be read as an admission that all the mining claims were valid."
1962.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.864,347.696,"Except for the mining claims, there was nothing here to condemn, wasn't it?"
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,347.696,348.928,I'm not certain --
1962.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.928,350.042,This was Government property.
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,350.59,362.081,"On the entire 3,000 acres which was the subject of this condemnation case, I think there -- I think there were some outstanding other interest, I'm not certain."
1962.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.648,369.662,Then there was an injunction?
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,369.662,394.184,"Then the Humboldt Company brought a separate suit seeking an injunction against the administrative proceedings on the ground that -- as their complaint alleged, all questions of title and a right of the United States to the use and occupation of said premises are wholly and entirely within the exclusive jurisdiction of it, by the entitled court."
1962.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.184,395.759,But this was -- this was public land.
1962.52,0,39932,roger_p_marquis,,396.667,398.157,That's right.
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3702.208,3707.729,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3894.412,3900.26,How long has the -- how long is the filing generally in the county?
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3900.26,3901.232,The county?
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.232,3902.044,Of the mining claims.
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3902.044,3907.795,"Some of these locations, there is a -- I go back to the early 90's."
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3910.923,3912.23,You mean some of the locations (Voice Overlap) --
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3912.23,3914.061,Some of the locations go way back --
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3914.061,3916.299,-- that are actually in the Condemnation Act?
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3916.299,3917.865,Actually in the Condemnation Act.
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3917.865,3920.368,Has there ever been a mining that went on?
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3920.368,3924.682,"Well, mine -- continuously up until 1942."
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3928.709,3939.755,"No, the issue -- well the issue before the -- in the -- the issue in the administrative proceeding would be what?"
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,3939.755,3945.122,"Will be nothing, as far as this people are concerned because, frankly, I can write that decision."
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4009.365,4016.335,But the Department also has the authority on the statutes to adjudicate the validity of the mining claim.
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,4016.335,4018.827,"Well, I can't find any such statute."
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4018.827,4022.308,"Oh, that's part of your cases that had been at --"
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,4022.308,4024.058,It's been an assumption.
1962.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4026.073,4034.096,"The part of your case here is the Department has no authority anyway, is there, under any statute to adjudicate the validity of mining claims?"
1962.52,1,19018,charles_l_gilmore,,4034.096,4052.534,"The only time they've ever had any authority is when they took it and they talk about the Cameron case, the Cameron case this Court was careful to state at its outset that Cameron went into the -- into that case without objection before the Land Department."
