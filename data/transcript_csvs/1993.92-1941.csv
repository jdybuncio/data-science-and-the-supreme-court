1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.537,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-1941, the United States v. Jerry W. Carlton."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,50.263,56.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.657,180.789,Was there any other manner to interpret it?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,193.056,208.728,"--We concede that it was a drafting defect in the sense that, as the retroactive amendment provided, that by its terms, the statute should have been limited to the sales of stock that were directly owned by the decedent at the time of death."
1993.92-1941,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,221.525,224.396,"Mr. Jones, do you have many cases like this pending?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,224.396,249.164,"--There are I believe three other... if cases like this you are talking about cases under section 2057... I believe there are three other cases, out of the thousands of estate tax returns that were filed during this period, three other instances where executors sought to take what we would regard as this aggressive interpretation of the statute."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.164,252.646,Do you think it was a mistake in interpretation of the statute?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,252.646,260.591,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, our position is not that it was unreasonable to take this tax position."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.71,295.494,And why should he have distrusted the result if that were a proper construction of the statute?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,295.494,303.69,"He should look at this as... as the ""Wall Street Journal"" article we cited describes it, as a tax maneuver."
1993.92-1941,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.139,326.504,"Well, what if we take the view that the language was clear and that it was all right to rely on it until it was corrected?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,328.355,330.726,"Well, then you would be... you would be embarking--"
1993.92-1941,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.726,332.769,"I mean, I think that's a perfectly sensible approach."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,333.879,338.913,--You would be embarking on a new constitutional approach to these cases.
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.251,389.135,Are there any... are there any cases thus far giving any real substance to legitimate Government interest?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,411.279,419.945,"--Well, that's... that's a question that I don't think that can be answered better than the Court did in Welch v. Henry."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.69,446.211,But Welch... Welch was a different case from this.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,455.288,467.267,"--Well, actually, in Welch, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the taxpayer contended that he purchased and held Wisconsin dividend stock in reliance on the economic inducement of the deduction."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,475.981,482.536,But didn't the Court also observe the fact that the receipt of income would have gone on regardless of what the statutory provision was?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,482.536,488.951,I think the... the Court did make the point that the dividends weren't going to be returned just because taxes were owed on them.
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.327,506.612,"Well, if the Court made that observation, you can say it's dicta, but you can argue that it wouldn't have made that observation if it didn't think it was of some importance."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,506.612,522.032,"Well, what wasn't dicta in... in... clearly in Welch was its statement that taxpayers must be prepared for the possibility of retroactive changes, and that there is no injustice in Congress, upon first learning of the effect of the tax, making a retroactive revision."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,522.032,523.863,Then there's no reliance rule ever?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,523.863,532.689,"There is no prior notice rule, and there is no reliance rule, nor is there a detrimental reliance rule or a reasonable reliance rule."
1993.92-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.46,561.637,"But they... they were talking about taxpayers generally, and not taxpayers... it does seem to me that there is something quite different about a provision that is written as an incentive to induce taxpayers to do something that is against their economic interest; namely, in these cases, to sell stock to these employee stock ownership plans, which will be sold at less than what you could get elsewhere, obviously, because the plan knows that it's... it's buying it from someone who has a real incentive to sell it to them."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,578.23,589.648,"--Well, it's not really different from Welch, because in Welch, the State of Wisconsin had adopted a... an incentive for ownership of Wisconsin corporate stock by exempting only Wisconsin dividends from the tax."
1993.92-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.101,635.215,"Well, what was the purpose of limiting this to stock that was owned previously, just before the death of the decedent?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,635.215,656.83,"The... the legislative history of the initial Act had described the fact that what this stock... what... what this provision was designed to do was to allow owners of businesses, upon their death, to encourage their estates to sell that ownership stock to the ESOP, and... and... so that it wouldn't go out into the public domain."
1993.92-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.416,671.931,"So, so, the thought was that this would apply primarily to stock that wasn't publicly traded?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,671.931,678.104,--I... I think it would be overstating the legislative history to go into that type of detail.
1993.92-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.977,683.958,"Well, but if the point of it is to--"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,683.958,684.74,It was designed to keep it out of the public.
1993.92-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.74,698.718,"--to encourage employee plans to begin... to have more ownership of the employer company, then the way the tax statute was drafted really did further that purpose."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,705.713,714.579,"I really don't think anyone could... could suggest that, in adopting this provision, Congress meant it to have its fullest possible reading."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.196,724.636,Well--
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,724.636,729.569,--Sit across the table from an... from the ESOP and hand stock back and forth until the--
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.569,732.731,"--Well, what more do we do other than read the... read the language that Congress has adopted?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,734.233,734.834,--Well--
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.834,739.846,"--Are you supposed to read a statute with the idea that, this is a weird provision, ergo, Congress never would have adopted it?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,743.81,744.509,--The only reason--
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.658,775.2,"Mr. Jones, that's what I'm trying to determine, is how far you carry that."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,824.661,829.386,"--Well, I think that there would be a constitutional issue."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,845.856,846.867,"Well, was it in that case?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,846.867,848.057,In which case?
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.848,849.95,The case that Justice Ginsburg just put to you.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,849.95,857.574,"Well, I'm... I would like to be able to tell you that there is a clear answer to that."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.971,877.376,"Then isn't the... isn't the answer simply that you can't seem to think of... of an example, or maybe we can't seem to think of an example which would ever run afoul of the rule."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,886.903,907.616,"I... I think that so long as what is... what Congress has enacted is either within the power to raise and levy taxes, or within the necessary and proper clause under Article I of the Constitution, that that resolves the question of whether this was a rational means of furthering a legitimate public interest."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.616,915.423,"Which is to say that the retroactive feature never, as such, combines with any other set of facts to invalidate the retroactive exercise?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,915.423,916.832,"I would not say that, personally."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.683,919.584,It seems to me that that's the implication of what you're saying.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,919.584,921.376,--There... there are two answers to that.
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,928.95,935.776,"Yes, but the answer to that is there are good reasons not to adopt a test, the meaning of which we do not understand."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,938.497,953.056,"Well, the test that I'm proposing, if you will, for the Court to adopt is a test that the Court has adopted in a string of maybe 20 cases in this century in which it has upheld retroactive tax cases as not being arbitrary or capricious."
1993.92-1941,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.056,955.737,"Even... even with that pedigree, I still do not understand."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,955.737,956.078,Right.
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1024.561,1028.105,That's saying trust Congress to be rational and just.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1050.592,1053.083,"Certainly, if it acts promptly to do so."
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.018,1062.499,"So, taking out that they have to act promptly can't be 13 years later?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1082.823,1088.667,There... the Court hasn't drawn a specific stopping point in terms of how far back you can go.
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.322,1221.092,"For what it's worth, didn't they sell below market even when they sold?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1221.092,1226.365,"It... well, this is a summary judgment case, and so it's hard to answer questions like that."
1993.92-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.766,1263.621,"If they didn't sell below market, I guess the market doesn't work the way everybody thinks it works."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1263.621,1264.029,"Well, they--"
1993.92-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.029,1277.93,"I mean, I cannot imagine a deal between somebody who knows that he gets a big tax benefit if he... if he sells it to a particular buyer, and that buyer knows that the seller gets a particular tax benefit, and the buyer comes in and says, hey, I'll give you a market."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1277.93,1278.711,--I'm not suggesting--
1993.92-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.711,1279.81,Human beings just don't operate that way.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1279.81,1282.282,--I'm not suggesting there might not have been some discount.
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.049,1311.902,"Well, the District Court granted summary judgment for the Government."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1317.945,1320.867,They entered judgment on the... on the stipulated record.
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.867,1325.071,On the... and was... did the stipulated record include anything about a sustained loss?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1325.071,1331.024,I think it showed the mathematics that... of what they paid for the stock and what they got back.
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.024,1335.158,"Well, can one fairly determine from that... those mathematics... whether there was a loss or not?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1335.158,1338.37,"One can determine there was a $631,000 loss."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1338.73,1340.02,And those are... those are stipulated facts?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1340.02,1340.641,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1350.997,1353.17,And it's also stipulated how much the estate tax savings was?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1353.17,1354.13,--Yes.
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1354.13,1355.662,And that was 2.5 million?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1355.662,1357.141,"Yes, that's correct."
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.563,1379.998,But your... your bottom line is Congress can withdraw a deduction as long as it does so promptly?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1383.1,1385.371,"Certain... in our view, certainly, if it does so promptly."
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.768,1429.172,"--Use, why don't we just call it use of a drafting defect, because if Congress had never changed it, never required the shares to be owned by the decedent--"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1429.172,1440.639,"I call it misuse because, as applied by the executor in this case, it would make all the other provisions of the Federal estate and gift tax super... superfluous."
1993.92-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.639,1447.735,"--Incidentally, why isn't this statute too good to be true even if you read it as later amended?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1454.219,1464.164,"Precisely for the reason that I think I just mentioned, and that was that it's too good to be true for the... when the statute really makes the whole tax go away."
1993.92-1941,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.181,1516.4,"--Mr. Jones, can I ask you if at any stage in this proceeding, did the IRS take the position that because the whole thing was too good to be true that it should not have been construed literally, but should have been construed, as some of the senators said, what they intended?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1516.4,1528.798,We... we are logically obstructed in trying to take that technical approach under... under the... under this Court's opinions... from the two-day holding period.
1993.92-1941,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.131,1537.711,"No, my question was a simpler one."
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1541.374,1545.198,I know that it was addressed in the Court of Appeals.
1993.92-1941,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.561,1552.361,"Well, then, you must have argued it if they rejected it?"
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1552.361,1552.782,I assume so.
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.396,1561.958,But here you're not trying to make any kind of business purpose test?
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1561.958,1565.761,This is a... this is a due process constitutional case.
1993.92-1941,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.761,1571.816,But let me... let me understand that I got your answer right to this.
1993.92-1941,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1583.672,1586.435,"Yes, I think Welch would stand for that proposition."
1993.92-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.625,1590.308,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1592.479,1599.354,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.364,1677.677,May I just interrupt with one question prompted by one of the amicus briefs that talks about procedural due process?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1681.949,1686.032,"I'm not sure that I understand the distinction, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.032,1688.533,Between procedural and substantive due process?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1693.135,1704.073,"As I read the Court's decisions, particularly in the retroactive tax cases, I find myself very confused and the line very fuzzy between what we're talking about."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1713.918,1719.605,That they gave you a 2.5 million deduction and then they took it away sounds pretty substantive to me.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1721.064,1723.315,"--Well, as Your Honor--"
1993.92-1941,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.315,1724.857,"It sounds like a pretty bad process, too."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1740.075,1744.208,"--I suppose it would depend on at which stage you're asking, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.877,1759.499,So then it is a substantive case?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1759.499,1761.95,Perhaps so.
1993.92-1941,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1761.95,1770.546,"Mr. Allen, were you counsel for the taxpayer at the time the income tax return was filed?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1770.546,1771.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1771.818,1778.413,It's none of my business; did you suggest this deduction or did the taxpayer say he wanted it?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1778.413,1787.686,The estate tax deduction I believe was the taxpayer's question to me in the first instance.
1993.92-1941,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.686,1807.401,"Mr. Allen, the... whether this is substantive due process or procedural due process, either way, you're saying that there is something that's under the due process clause, which rather duplicates what's in the ex post facto clause."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1854.131,1859.826,"I believe that, as a general proposition, you're correct; that we do not have that sort of blanket."
1993.92-1941,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1900.411,1902.772,But is that a criterion or is that a conclusion?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1924.077,1927.769,"--I submit, Your Honor, that it depends on your focus."
1993.92-1941,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1976.715,1979.665,"Mr. Allen, who are the beneficiaries of this estate?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1979.665,1984.669,"--The beneficiaries are the four children of Willametta Day, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1984.669,1986.239,Let me ask another unfair question.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,1994.416,2006.284,"It seems to me that but for the specific inducement of this statute, the executor would have committed a very clear breach of trust, by selling off the market and below market value."
1993.92-1941,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.479,2024.684,I suppose if the Government had been decent about the thing in its retroactive curative legislation it would have at least allowed a credit for any loss that had been taken.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2024.684,2028.547,"You might say that, Your Honor, but I certainly couldn't."
1993.92-1941,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.117,2047.371,"And what... what you say... what you say about... about evaluating the harshness and oppressiveness leads me to believe that you think this statute may be invalid as to some taxpayers and valid as to others, depending upon how harshly and oppressively its impact is felt."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2050.393,2050.871,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.483,2054.384,"--And you say $600,000 is harsh and oppressive?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2054.384,2060.498,"I would not define it in $600,000 as much as I would in the circumstances of the case taken as a whole."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.88,2080.723,"But if... the $600,000 is balanced against... to the extent of this... having your estate tax, that's a rather... one of the questions that puzzled me is there was... this was a rather large estate, and yet you did this with a relatively small piece of it."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2084.554,2091.188,"--Well, it isn't always easy to do as much as one might hypothetically want to do."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2130.776,2139.441,"But if you had found a few more ESOP's you could have... and if you prevail, you could have made that tax bill very much lower?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2139.441,2141.873,"--At least in theory we certainly could have, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2144.184,2155.262,"And Justice Scalia asked you a question before... I mean, to get such an advantage, it seems that $600,000 really wasn't a whole lot... wasn't a very large loss."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2167.621,2177.519,The amount of the discount was determined in bargaining between the executor and a representative of the ESOP after the stock had been acquired.
1993.92-1941,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.456,2192.077,Excuse me.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2195.26,2196.231,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.298,2281.779,"Given... given the rather significant estate tax advantage, do you disagree with the characterization, looking at this provision, this is too good to be true, it's too good to last?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2281.779,2287.402,"It seems to me that there are two problems with the Government's ""too good to be true"" argument."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.373,2324.796,Too good to be true in the sense of... of the tremendous estate tax savings that was involved.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2324.796,2337.346,"--But as one of the questions directed to the Solicitor General noted, we... the ""too good to be true"" doesn't reflect anything in the economics of the transaction."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2351.623,2353.725,Then you would have a rather circumscribed group.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2361.621,2362.47,That's right.
1993.92-1941,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.947,2401.036,"So, you're saying that there is nothing in the record from which we could either conclude or take judicial notice that most practitioners would be on notice that this statute was likely to be amended?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2401.036,2403.737,"At the time the executor made this sale, that is exactly true, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2403.737,2406.779,"And I don't mean amended retroactively, amended at all."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2406.779,2411.024,"I think that is true, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.061,2430.605,"But you don't disagree that if had stayed on the books, then every estate that could would have tried to make this kind of transaction, I guess, or--"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2430.605,2433.637,--We might have ended up with a lot more stock in the hands of ESOP's.
1993.92-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.448,2436.028,--Mr. Allen.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2436.028,2436.669,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.669,2463.596,"Taking the concept of a clerical error on one side, that everybody can see that Congress meant to write a law that said 5 percent, and by mistake 10 percent was printed, and on the other side, a mistaken judgment on the part of Congress, where Congress enacts a tax benefit law and later decides this is just killing our revenue, do you think there is room for any kind of ""too good to be true"" concept in between those two concepts?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2463.596,2468.362,"There may well be, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.166,2551.385,"So, is there anything in this record or in documents from which we can take public notice that would indicate that a member of the bar would be on notice that this was likely to be repealed, and repealed retroactively?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2551.385,2562.763,"--I know of nothing in the record in this case for which this Court can take judicial notice at this time... I know of nothing at this time, as of the time that the executor acted in this case."
1993.92-1941,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.763,2565.194,Other than perhaps our assessment that it's too good to be true?
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2565.194,2567.325,"With due respect, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2574.501,2583.397,"Part of a measure with... rather, the Long measure of this provision came up in... in the bill that had how much in it?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2583.397,2591.771,"--This provision was part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was a major piece of tax legislation."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.765,2661.707,"The Government, in fact, didn't make that argument."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2665.219,2683.001,"I believe, Your Honor, it also, in its reply brief, argues, at footnotes eight and nine, that this was too good to be true because of the magnitude of Government largesse."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.482,2791.884,"Mr. Allen, you're very persuasive on all the pitfalls here."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2819.052,2824.165,"--I don't believe that our analysis necessarily goes that far, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.165,2827.958,"--I'm assuming no windfall, no notice of anything, just the Government needs a little more money."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2830.21,2831.599,"Well, I'm not sure."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.593,2836.734,Assume it goes back no more than two or three years.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2836.734,2840.067,And I also think there is a question of prior history.
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.193,2912.412,"But, see, the thrust of my question is, is the detrimental reliance that you have in this case really anything different than the ordinary investor faces in... in buying and selling stocks... if the tax rates are 25 percent on capital gains, then, two years later, the Government changes the rules on them?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2915.004,2916.005,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2955.742,2960.335,I didn't understand Justice Stevens' question as being related to a multiyear transaction.
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2968.959,2971.671,--Perhaps I misunderstood the question.
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.442,2974.443,"Of course, it's multiyear in the sense that he made the purchase earlier."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,2991.138,2992.388,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.04,3028.913,"Yes, but your... your client expected to pay estate taxes, he just didn't expect to pay quite as much... quite as high a tax."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3028.913,3030.843,--No--
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.843,3033.995,"I mean, he... he... this is not going to eliminate the tax, it's just going to change the amount of the tax."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3033.995,3037.298,"--I think there is a fundamental difference, Your Honor."
1993.92-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.027,3107.455,"Well, but I suppose the closer example for me then would be a statute in 1989 repealing the capital gains tax entirely, and then, two years later, the new administration comes in and said, gee, they made a mistake, so we're going to reimpose the tax."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3109.816,3113.389,"--There, it seems to me, you have a very different kind of motivational problem."
1993.92-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.991,3136.253,"But it wouldn't, conceivably, under Justice Stevens' hypothetical."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3146.479,3155.055,"Well, it seems to me the problem, Your Honor, is that it's very difficult to tell, once we give in to the question of what motivated them to do something."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3182.082,3199.153,"You mean... are you making a distinction between you did it simply to get... to take advantage of... of lowering your estate tax by 50 percent to the extent of this, and other people may have mixed motives; they're doing it both to lower their tax and for some other economic reason, therefore your case should be more sympathetic?"
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3201.316,3201.816,What I'm--
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.816,3206.669,"That other people have a business purpose, you have no business purpose other than to save this tax."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3206.669,3214.703,"--No executor would sell at a below-market price, off the market, except to take advantage of the estate tax deduction promised."
1993.92-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.703,3217.795,"So, your motive is pure, it's simply to save tax."
1993.92-1941,1,38525,russell_g_allen,,3224.861,3229.003,I'm suggesting that becomes analytically much more difficult and much more complicated.
1993.92-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.022,3271.691,"--Thank you, Mr. Allen."
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3274.012,3274.894,Thank you.
1993.92-1941,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3302.142,3312.73,"I would be curious, Mr. Jones, as to how you would answer the question posed by Justice Blackmun: Do you think the executor here would be liable for fiduciary breach?"
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3312.73,3320.245,I would have to admit that the fiduciary duties of executors is something with which I am not wholly familiar.
1993.92-1941,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3320.245,3320.886,Well--
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3320.886,3322.548,I'm not sure I could offer an opinion on that.
1993.92-1941,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3322.548,3325.31,--Let... let me advise you that it's a breach of due care.
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3329.391,3332.594,I think the executor took a calculated risk.
1993.92-1941,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3348.123,3349.415,"I'm sorry, I'm not following this."
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3355.677,3356.058,--Right.
1993.92-1941,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.058,3359.431,--They didn't try to present any business purpose.
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3365.495,3368.057,The business purpose is the wrong word.
1993.92-1941,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3380.795,3388.329,"Mr. Jones, I assume that the beneficiaries of the estate were parties to this decision in a sense of being advised as to--"
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3388.329,3389.541,The record certainly doesn't tell us.
1993.92-1941,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.687,3408.294,"--Well, for what it's worth, I suppose we shouldn't be offering opinions on irrelevant subjects, but I certainly don't think that it would be a breach of the executor's duty, given the state of the law at the time they acted."
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3408.294,3409.143,I... my--
1993.92-1941,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.143,3410.194,I don't think that's any part of your case.
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3410.194,3410.485,--It--
1993.92-1941,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3410.485,3412.187,Certainly not if he wins the case.
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3412.187,3412.576,--It's not my case.
1993.92-1941,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.576,3414.028,Certainly not if he wins the--
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3415.558,3417.34,I don't... I certainly wouldn't dispute that.
1993.92-1941,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3419.351,3421.092,"The point is, is that it's reasonable."
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3421.092,3423.635,"--We didn't think that he was acting unreasonably, we just--"
1993.92-1941,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.635,3424.925,"Your time has expired, Mr. Jones."
1993.92-1941,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3425.846,3428.177,--Thank you.
