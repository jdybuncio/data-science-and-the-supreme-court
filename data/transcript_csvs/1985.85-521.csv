1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.114,We'll hear arguments next in Bowen against Public Agencies.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,52.967,59.229,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.193,102.539,"Does your position, your argument, assume that Congress could have put all of them under Social Security in the first instance?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,102.539,113.405,"It certainly does, Mr. Chief Justice, and in fact the District Court assumed arguendo that was the case, and appellees in this case do not argue to the contrary either."
1985.85-521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,405.168,412.733,"Mr. Willard, are there any other public assistance programs subject to agreements like the 418 Agreement?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,412.733,417.708,"There are programs that are implemented in a similar way, Justice Brennan."
1985.85-521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.012,459.135,Was that because of the Tenth Amendment jurisprudence?
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,459.135,463.399,"--That was presumably the problem, Justice O'Connor, that concerned them."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.42,598.175,"That isn't to say it was negotiable or not from the statement that I... part of it might certainly true, that without that statutory provision they never would have entered into this."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,598.175,601.638,"--That is certainly possible, Justice White, but it was distinctly a minor--"
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.638,604.951,"--for the foundation to be probable, you really don't know, do you?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,604.951,611.987,--There is no evidence about what the state of mind was of the State when it entered into the agreements.
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.987,615.429,"Well, why do you think Congress wrote it in, just as a--"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,615.429,626.756,"The reason, Justice White, appears to be, and the 1982 legislative history corroborates this, is that they thought it was simply a necessary incident of having a voluntary program."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.355,644.207,"--You rejected that idea, that it was bait for the states?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,644.207,652.282,"Most categorically, Mr. Chief Justice, and there is no evidence in the record that it had been... in that sense it's much like the--"
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.282,654.142,"There is no evidence to the contrary, is there?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,654.142,672.584,"--No, there isn't, Mr. Justice White, but if I could refer to El Paso against Simmons, a case where the Court held that the perpetual right of redemption of interest defaulters in Texas was not the key inducement of the contract, and in that case the Court didn't go back and consider evidence about the state of mind of purchasers under that contract."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.872,690.787,"Well, how many states wanted to withdraw at the time that that was an amendment?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,690.787,693.228,--I don't have the exact number.
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.228,696.721,"There were quite a few, I suppose."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,696.721,697.512,There were.
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.835,708.949,"But the fact is, it would appear that the right to withdrawal was a rather important item?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,708.949,713.884,"That is not necessarily evidence of the importance of that in 1950, Justice White."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.945,721.128,It certainly looks more in that direction than in yours.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,721.128,735.238,"--It may provide an evidence about the intent of the states today, but with all respect, I think that as to their intent in 1950, and the legislative history indicates... this was Congress's view, this was a very minor provision of the contract."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.677,743.172,Let's assume that some state that had never been in the program was thinking about getting into it now.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,751.507,755.651,"--If that were the state's understanding now, then that could have an impact."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.099,781.549,Then I'd have to say it was superfluous.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,781.549,784.671,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying it's superfluous."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.124,822.965,"We'll resume at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Willard."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,852.355,878.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have just been referring to Section 1304 of the Act which provides express notice of Congress's reservation of the right to amend, repeal or alter the Social Security Act, and this was part of the Act at the time the Section 418 agreements were entered into in 1951, and certainly provided notice that the statutory pattern was subject to change."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,936.851,957.314,"Mr. Willard, do you take the position that... at least indirectly, that the United States is not bound by a provision which it makes in one of its own contracts, and if it could have made the contract without that provision?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,957.314,961.596,"That is not our position, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,998.51,1016.513,"I suppose that's bottomed on your early premise that you mentioned before lunch, that the government, without consulting any of the states or the local governments, could have made all of their employees subject to Social Security from the outset?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1016.513,1025.94,"--Well, that is certainly our position in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, and it is not a position that the district court or any of the appellees have seriously disagreed with."
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1038.636,1049.185,"But if that were not so, if the government could not have exercised that authority, then would you say they would be bound by the contract provision?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1049.185,1053.077,"It would certainly place the case in a different light, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.264,1083.816,"Well, doesn't it make a lot of difference whether the government is acting without the authorization of Congress, and who do we mean when we are saying the government here, whether the government is acting at the express authorization of Congress or whether it's just... the Executive branch is deciding to break a contract, about which perhaps Congress has said nothing?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1083.816,1091.53,"Well, certainly, Justice Rehnquist, we do not argue here that the Executive has a right to break contracts at all."
1985.85-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.957,1131.939,But Congress is unilaterally altering the contract.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1131.939,1152.662,"Well, the question that everyone is assuming, and I think the case law is clear, that Congress could do that if it chose to do so, in effect and that the... that Congress... that the nine million state and local government employees covered by Social Security don't have a perpetual right of withdrawal as a result of the Section 418 agreements entered into."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.459,1230.353,"But disallowing withdrawal costs the states some money, doesn't it?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1230.353,1232.346,--It certainly does.
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.346,1236.958,"Quite a bit, otherwise you wouldn't have been interested in abrogating this contract?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1236.958,1239.7,"Well, I think the legislative history--"
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.7,1250.306,"Well, it does cost them some money, an so why isn't the taking, the taking of the money, not contract right... they're forcing the state to pay some money."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1250.306,1256.79,"--The states and their employees are of course forced to bear an economic burden, but they are also receiving benefits for it."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.483,1261.064,"Well, I know."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1266.778,1272.632,"Well, Justice White, as I indicated they're not required to spend that money on taking care of their employees."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.632,1273.583,That's right.
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1281.208,1284.23,That is certainly the effect of this legislation.
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.23,1287.442,And that the government promised that they wouldn't have to spend?
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1287.442,1293.827,"That's... the government did not promise that, specifically, in our view, because the statute--"
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.827,1296.667,"--specifically, nonspecifically, or unspecifically?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1296.667,1303.032,"--Section 1304 of the statute gave notice that the scheme was subject to alteration, repeal and amendment."
1985.85-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.413,1315.19,Do you think that provision means that although you... that means that we can amend this contract to eliminate the withdrawal right?
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1315.19,1316.56,That's our position.
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1316.56,1342.116,"Don't you have to persuade the Court... Mr. Willard, doesn't the government have to persuade the Court that given the right which you have asserted, that Congress could have put this on every employee of every one of the governmental subdivisions in the first place, that authority could not be contracted away by the provision which is in question here?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1342.116,1349.332,"That is our position, Mr. Chief Justice, and it's a position which no one has disagreed with, not the district court, not the appellees."
1985.85-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.618,1380.071,"Mr. Willard, could that have been the first instance that caused this burden on the employees of California and no other state, for example?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1385.807,1388.037,"Well, a small number of them did."
1985.85-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.653,1407.519,"Yes, but to the extent that you rely on the fact that we might have written the statute that accomplishes this result, my question is, could you have written a statute that applied to 45 states but not 50?"
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1407.519,1410.872,"--Well, that would depend on what the rationale was, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.872,1414.635,"Well, if they had made it known early enough that they didn't want to be part of it, that's all."
1985.85-521,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1414.635,1417.688,That's not the way that this statute operates.
1985.85-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1472.541,1474.103,"Very well, Mr. Willard."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1483.761,1487.451,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.986,1566.813,"Well, then you say that the contract is binding and that the federal sovereign authority could make a waiver of a sovereign right which it had?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1566.813,1572.437,"--Mr. Chief Justice, this is not a case where the federal government has given up any sovereign right."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.396,1596.482,"Then, could the federal government assert its sovereign right, to put everybody under, as they could have in the first place?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1596.482,1599.665,"--We will assume that for purposes of this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.665,1605.078,"If that's true, then what are we spending all the time on?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1605.078,1607.502,We're spending all the time on this for two reasons.
1985.85-521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1646.948,1654.683,Do you think that Congress could have mandated coverage of only the state and local employees who were already covered?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1656.706,1658.876,"--I think not, Justice O'Connor, and let me tell you why."
1985.85-521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1690.617,1701.165,"Well, Mr. Hurwitz, if... you don't concede, but I gather you assume that Congress could have forced the states into the Social Security system?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1701.165,1703.215,"We do assume that, Justice Brennan."
1985.85-521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1703.215,1709.441,"Well, I'd like to say what's the difference, if it now prohibits states from withdrawing?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1709.441,1714.754,"Justice Brennan, what it has done in this case is not prohibit every state from withdrawing from the system."
1985.85-521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1753.108,1756.28,"Does that suggest, Mr. Hurwitz, that this is really just a contract--"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1756.28,1760.573,"Mr. Justice Brennan, in essence it is."
1985.85-521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.468,1773.481,"--Well, if it's just a contract action, why do you need to rely on the takings clause?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1773.481,1782.127,"--We rely on the takings clause in addition to making our contract claims, Justice Brennan, because contract rights are property rights as this Court has pointed out."
1985.85-521,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1786.741,1791.393,In what case have we said a contract right was a property right?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1791.393,1795.908,"This Court said it most recently in the Monsanto case, in the case dealing with trade secrets."
1985.85-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.339,1804.102,How could you have sued the United States on a contract?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1804.102,1807.154,"Well, that would have been rather difficult."
1985.85-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.154,1808.193,I would think it would.
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1811.308,1822.454,"Well, I suppose we could have proceeded in the claims court under the Tucker Act and sought compensation, but what we were really claiming here was that this was a taking, and violating our constitutional rights."
1985.85-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.454,1823.674,Inverse [inaudible].
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1823.674,1824.505,Sir?
1985.85-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.505,1826.325,That's... do you want an injunction?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1826.325,1830.799,We don't want... we asked for an injunction but what we really wanted was a declaration.
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1842.107,1854.654,"Mr. Hurwitz, Section... I think 1304 presented the right to the Congress to amend or repeal any section of the Social Security Act, as I understood it."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1854.654,1855.966,"That's correct, Justice Powell."
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1855.966,1869.335,"What is your comment or response with respect to the effect of where it repealed, in that section of the Act, in light of what the Congress did in 1983 when it did in fact repeal the statute you rely on?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1869.335,1875.848,"Justice Powell, Section 1304 allowed Congress to amend a repeal to the Act."
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1925.961,1930.235,"They did have the right to repeal 1418, didn't they?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1930.235,1931.905,"They certainly did, Justice Powell."
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1931.905,1934.376,And isn't that the statute you rely on?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1934.376,1937.649,"No, we're not, Justice Powell."
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1937.649,1939.231,"You relied on the original there, didn't you?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1939.231,1947.595,"We relied originally not only on Section 418, but moved on the written contract which we were given by the United States, which California signed."
1985.85-521,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1947.595,1952.438,"Contract, though, only possible because of 418, at the time?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1952.438,1953.66,"That is correct, Justice Powell."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1957.393,1976.775,Suppose the government in its sovereign authority tomorrow decides to acknowledge the right of the states to terminate but also hits them under Social Security beginning at midnight on the same time as the termination.
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1978.017,1985.62,"If it does that with respect to all the states, Mr. Chief Justice, then we'll go back to the district court, litigate our claims about whether mandatory coverage is permissible."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.052,1989.163,Wait a minute.
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,1993.835,1997.098,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we have assumed that for purposes of this case."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2089.439,2092.882,"But the fact it's unique, Mr. Hurwitz, doesn't mean it's unconstitutional."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2092.882,2094.442,"No, quite to the contrary, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.411,2111.892,"Not by the contracts clause, but by the takings clause?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2111.892,2122.19,"That's correct, the contracts clause is not applicable to the federal government, although we do think that there's an analog in the due process clause that would require the federal government also to live up to its contracts."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.19,2124.03,"Well, what sort of an analog is that?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2124.03,2135.278,This case... this Court in the Thorpe case indicated that for practical purposes the due process clause could be viewed as the federal equivalent of the contracts clause.
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.656,2149.679,Was Thorpe a holding to that effect?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2149.679,2154.02,"Thorpe was not a holding to that effect, but the language in Thorpe on that point, I think, is quite clear."
1985.85-521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.516,2165.087,"Mr. Hurwitz, can I ask you a question about that?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2179.918,2184.031,"I think, Your Honor... let me tell you why, by way of an example."
1985.85-521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2279.405,2282.277,"Mr. Hurwitz, you speak of ""we""."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2284.14,2286.989,"I am, Your Honor, and I am also representing the other appellees."
1985.85-521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2286.989,2290.962,Because your name appears on down in the amicus brief.
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2290.962,2296.426,"Your Honor, I was fortunate enough to be asked by the parties to appear today, and I am grateful for that opportunity."
1985.85-521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2296.426,2302.252,Would you say the State of California... is the State really a party?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2302.252,2303.361,"The State is a party, Your Honor."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.861,2322.014,"Mr. Hurwitz, there were some cases decided during the '30s, Dodge being one of them, where the Depression came and contract rights of teachers and other public employees were cut back on by states, and the states generally won those cases."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2330.159,2332.21,"I hope not, Your Honor."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.414,2382.312,"Well, wasn't Dodge between the state agency or... otherwise you wouldn't get into it at all, you wouldn't get into the prohibition against impairment of contracts if you simply had a private party."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2382.312,2387.667,"Dodge was a case, as I recall, Justice Rehnquist, between an employee and the Board of Education."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.932,2402.167,"Well, do you think the case would have come out differently if the Act had been passed by the county board of supervisors rather than by the state?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2402.167,2403.516,"Oh, no, quite to the contrary."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.078,2426.691,But isn't the governmental agency and the state the same for constitutional purposes in that situation?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2426.691,2431.015,"They are, Justice Rehnquist, but in that case the challenge was to the Act."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.885,2481.167,What if the government makes a contract which it is not legally authorized to make?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2481.167,2486.621,"It may well be under those circumstances, Mr. Chief Justice, that the contract would be invalid ab initio."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2486.621,2492.985,"The entire contract, or just the particular unlawful clause?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2492.985,2497.319,"I would think under these circumstances, Mr. Chief Justice, you would have to strike the whole contract."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.774,2573.631,"Do you disagree, then, with the government's reading of Perry against United States that was based solely on the monetary clause?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2573.631,2592.211,"I do, Your honor, and it seems to me that when one looks at Lynch, which is a circumstance where the government was acting again under the taxing and spending power, as it is in this case, and one looks at the Darlington case, particularly Justice Harland's dissent, the message seems to be clear that the government is bound by its agreements."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.565,2612.967,Even though Congress has expressly authorized the government to break the contract?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2612.967,2615.158,"I think that's right, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.061,2628.127,"Therefore, any breach of contract that Congress authorizes is automatically a violation of the takings clause?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2629.499,2640.786,"Justice Rehnquist, we in our brief... and I would argue today that Congress is entitled under certain circumstances, under certain limited circumstances, to abrogate contracts."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.049,2649.492,The U.S. Trust was an impairment of contracts clause case.
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2649.492,2650.702,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.702,2653.866,Which you agree has no application to the federal government?
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2653.866,2654.748,That's correct.
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.614,2686.978,"But that's a specific clause of the constitution, that is involved here, that doesn't apply to the federal government."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2686.978,2688.46,"--I agree, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.46,2691.602,"So, why do you derive so much comfort from that case?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2691.602,2698.217,"Justice Rehnquist, I think that that case indicates that's the least standard that the federal government can be held to."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.288,2707.922,"But the clause on which that case depended, which interpreted it, applies to the states but not to the United States?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2707.922,2709.775,"--I absolutely agree, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.392,2725.714,"Well, that argument by analogy should have been made at the Constitutional Convention."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2733.618,2736.012,"--Justice Rehnquist, I assume that's correct."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.945,2753.714,"Therefore, you would require an affirmative authorization in the Constitution to allow the United States to disavow one of its contracts rather than vice versa?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2753.714,2769.121,"No, I think there is a prohibition, Justice Rehnquist, in the Constitution of the United States walking away from its contract, and that prohibition is in the takins clause because this Court has recognized time and again that contractual rights and other intangibles are property rights."
1985.85-521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.121,2797.301,"Well, Mr. Hurwitz, it seems to me the weakness of the argument is in not recognizing the possibility that the contract itself reserved the right to the federal government to withdraw by virtue of its reference to the federal law, which it made applicable, and the federal law said provided for the right of Congress to repeal or amend the act."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2804.918,2815.654,"Justice O'Connor, let me take another shot at it and see if I can... the contract contained the clause, an explicit clause allowing the state to withdraw from the agreement."
1985.85-521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2908.997,2912.82,"Well, in effect I think perhaps it did."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2912.82,2918.684,"Justice O'Connor, I think that's a view of the case we just simply don't share."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2952.969,2959.625,"Weren't those cases, Mr. Hurwitz, in which Congress had not specifically provided to the contrary?"
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2959.625,2966.098,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist, because those were cases in which the contract was in effect defined by the statute."
1985.85-521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.881,2976.665,"Yes, but then Congress comes along in 1983 and says, we now wish this contract repudiated."
1985.85-521,1,16180,andrew_d_hurwitz,,2976.665,2984.999,"Once having entered into that contract, Justice Rehnquist, we think Congress has no greater ability to repudiate the contract than the Executive would have had."
1985.85-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.747,3058.457,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Willard?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3058.457,3061.47,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.446,3140.272,"Under that case, I take it, it wouldn't have made any difference if the government had reserved in its initial contract the power to amend the statute?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3140.272,3142.263,--That would have kind of made a difference.
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3142.263,3146.617,"Well, like saying, we've now decided to amend this by not paying you at all?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3146.617,3151.87,"Justice White, I think if the contract... if the statute had included that reserved right expressly--"
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.87,3157.233,"You mean, just generally, we have the power to amend?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3157.233,3159.474,--If that's what it said--
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.474,3170.151,"If a person said it... it just includes a general power to amend, and so it could amend and say, we know you've performed an awful lot of work for us but we're not going to pay you now?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3170.151,3172.833,--If that's what it provided.
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3172.833,3175.294,"Well, it isn't what the contract provided expressly."
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3176.937,3177.775,In this case it did.
1985.85-521,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.16,3265.262,"May I ask, would the constitutional issue be any different if Congress did no more than accept this over the system?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3265.262,3271.467,"--That would present a case... well, that would present a case that would be closer to the Lynch situation."
1985.85-521,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.081,3309.824,"Yes, but I think you would make the same argument, they could get a better bargain elsewhere?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3309.824,3318.871,"Well, I don't think that's necessarily true, Justice Stevens, and the legislative history carefully documents it, that in most of these cases Congress found that the employees were not getting a better bargain elsewhere."
1985.85-521,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3358.046,3361.279,"Mr. Willard, a few states now have withdrawn."
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3365.251,3371.286,"--Well, the legislative history has some information about it in general, although it doesn't document what happened in each case."
1985.85-521,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3388.746,3390.917,Some coverage was provided?
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3390.917,3395.622,"It said in most of the cases, but there's no legal requirement, Justice Powell, that they provide it."
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.659,3420.347,"Mr. Willard, suppose Congress said... they passed a law putting all the states under... purporting to put all the states under this Social Security system."
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3436.349,3442.091,Apparently they're not willing to assert that kind of a claim because they're not that sure of themselves.
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.091,3444.453,"Well, I know, but I just wondered what difference it would make."
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3444.453,3457.452,"Well, that's the essence of our position, Justice White, is that since it wouldn't make a difference those vested contract rights such as they are couldn't be worth very much if they wouldn't stand up in the face of that kind of legislative enactment."
1985.85-521,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.452,3464.987,"And that issue, whether Congress has the power to put them all in or not, isn't in this case, is it?"
1985.85-521,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3464.987,3468.69,"No one has disagreed with that, including the District Court and the appellees."
1985.85-521,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3473.524,3476.136,"Thank you, gentlemen."
