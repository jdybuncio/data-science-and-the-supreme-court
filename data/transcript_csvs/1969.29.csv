1969.29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.645,Shore Line against United Transportation Union.
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,14.772,18.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.29,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.922,398.41,That is proposing the negotiation of a provision under the collective bargaining contract that would so provide.
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,398.41,408.822,That's right and which would deny Shore Line of the right that they then had to establish the outlying points.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.552,1325.665,"Mr. Shea, I take it that you would argue that if there were no agreement at all between a carrier and its employees, but they were in the process of negotiating agreements that the employer could, pending the working out of Section -- of these mediation procedures change wages?"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1325.665,1329.029,I would because this Courts squarely so held in Williams.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.029,1337.474,"Yes, and would you say that the Union might waive its strike?"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1337.474,1342.218,I would say no because I think that was so held in Williams.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.218,1358.291,"So, the Union is -- may not strike pending the resolution of the mediation procedures, but the carrier may change wages, hours or working conditions so long as they are not governed by an existing agreement?"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1358.291,1363.975,"They may exercise -- yes, they may exercise those rights that they then have."
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.975,1376.681,"Well, and apparently you agree that this business of establishing an outlying terminal was subject to Section 6 procedures?"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1376.681,1378.023,One subject to Section 6 procedures.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.023,1379.292,I mean it was proper for the Union --
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1379.292,1384.206,We're not raising here the issue that this was purely a matter of managerial discretion.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.206,1388.031,"Well, this was the point of the matter because as far as this case is concerned --"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1388.031,1389.725,"Well, I think it wasn't but --"
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.725,1390.314,"Well, I know but --"
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1390.314,1392.616,So far as the argument here is concerned --
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.616,1393.928,So far as the issue here is concerned --
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1393.928,1394.45,That's right.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.45,1399.316,-- this is just as though on wages.
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1399.316,1399.747,Yes.
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.375,1401.889,In the absence of an agreement?
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1401.889,1404.061,"Yes, I think that's right."
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.219,1419.731,You mean agreed upon by the (Voice Overlap).
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1419.731,1443.052,"Yes, but also have this in mind that very often, there will be a controversy and it will be allowed to drop if there were a decision which required that every right the railroad had had to be in that agreement, you'd compromise the possibilities of reaching agreements very largely indeed."
1969.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.052,1464.751,"I take it that (Voice Overlap) -- I take it that you would take this as no difference than if the railroad proposed to build a spur and the Union didn't want the spur built, so they filed a Section 6 notice to keep the railroad from building the spur."
1969.29,0,24581,francis_m_shea,,1472.119,1478.566,"If it's entitled to honor existing agreements, I should say, certainly they ought to be permitted to go in and build it."
1969.29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.139,1762.702,"Thank you, Mr. Shea."
1969.29,1,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1764.709,1768.486,Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Justices.
1969.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.251,2192.134,"Leaving more than claimed rights under the agreement in this particular case, aren't they Mr. Lyman, hadn't that."
1969.29,1,39817,richard_r_lyman,,2209.505,2210.094,"Yes, I would like to --"
1969.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.094,2219.391,"It was decided by the -- by an Adjustment Board that under the existing collective bargaining agreement, management had the right to make outlying assignments."
1969.29,1,39817,richard_r_lyman,,2221.465,2229.906,I think that should be defined somewhat because it may enter into Your Honor's consideration of this matter.
1969.29,2,24581,francis_m_shea,,3594.859,3597.935,Unless the Court has questions --
1969.29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3597.935,3599.464,I think not.
