1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.23,We will hear arguments next in Franks and Lee against Bowman Transportation Company.
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,36.336,39.632,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,382.06,402.47,"When the seniority is granted, that is at who's expense in a sense, if the seniority is retroactively granted, what happens to the man who -- how’s the seniority now, this is not something that can be divided, is it?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,406.028,409.819,We do not seek to take seniority from any white driver.
1975.74-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.848,428.114,But can it make a difference (Inaudible)?
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,428.114,432.262,"It would make a difference in competitive position, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1975.74-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.262,440.656,It would mean perhaps of that a black driver would retain a job when a white driver would have to be laid off.
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,440.656,442.78,That is theoretically correct.
1975.74-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.85,446.293,"Well, is that practically correct? Or do you have a—"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,446.293,451.922,As a practical matter in this case Mr. Justice Brennan we have a high turn over situation.
1975.74-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.856,458.606,This decision will not be for this case alone?
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,458.606,459.777,I am aware of that.
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.484,492.485,"It suggests that somewhere in your brief, I got the impression that you at least (Inaudible) that they took these jobs with a sort of a lien on them even though they might be innocent of any participation in the failure on the conduct on which this action is based."
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,499.352,512.735,"The question is not the quality of behavior of the whites who were hired, it is the quality of behavior of the company in rejecting blacks and the remedy would—"
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,512.735,524.338,"But if you take something away from the driver hired earlier, you are depriving him of something that he thought that he had, are you not?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,524.338,541.873,"Mr. Chief Justice I would reiterate our position that we do not seek to take any seniority away from whites, they will have to compete with blacks also enable to utilize their seniority but we feel that is the central thrust of the law."
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,541.873,554.312,Going to the specific practical problems Mr. Justice Brennan alluded to on a lay off and we must deal with the generality and not the idiosyncrasies of this company.
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,566.261,572.961,"If a lay-off comes and it cuts deep enough to involve the seniority dates we are talking about, that would be correct."
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,573.71,582.34,"How would we justify taking away in affect, taking away from Peter to pay Paul?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,588.436,601.853,"Mr. Chief Justice the lay-off issue, I would suggest is in fact not a single issue but a series of issues which may arise in different situations, none of which of course are presented in this case."
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,604.127,605.845,"It is lurking in this case, is it not?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,605.845,624.424,"We submit that there will be cases in which as a result of restitution of seniority rights to black employees followed by lay-offs, there may indeed the white employees unable under those circumstances to all their jobs."
1975.74-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,682.117,700.168,"Bowman’s operations do not present the problem either, do they where someone may have come in one capacity and gradually moved up to more and more responsible positions where you might have some question of job qualification for what that person is shooting for."
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,700.168,706.388,"This is a simple case involving in regard to this issue, one job."
1975.74-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.72,782.937,"Of course in Albemarle the statutes specifically and said including back pay, here it does not specifically deal with seniority."
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,782.937,798.939,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist the section, remedial section of course is the same and it authorizes the award of any relief as maybe appropriate and we think that would apply to injunctive remedies as well as back pay."
1975.74-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.939,806.705,"Well, would you think that seniority would follow as inexorably as back pay would in the typical case?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,806.705,823.207,Mr. Justice Rehnquist I would think perhaps even more inexorably since a job gives to its holder not merely pay but also other benefits and seniority in a situation like this is a key to the job.
1975.74-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.207,833.401,Well then why did congress single out back pay and mention it in not single seniority?
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,833.401,845.56,"Mr. Justice that provision, Section 706 (G) was modeled on Section 10 (c) of the NLRA which was concerned primarily with jobs."
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,879.67,885.848,Even at the expense of an innocent fellow employee?
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,885.848,899.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, court after court has held that the expectations of white employees even though innocent of wrong doing maybe modified in order to grant full relief under the Act."
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.317,910.496,"Was that before we had some things to say about the expectations of employees in the last two years, I would place it?"
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,910.496,911.629,Those --
1975.74-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.629,914.296,School teachers cases for example?
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,914.296,923.893,"Mr. Chief Justice, those decisions began to come down as soon as cases were decided on the merits in about 1968 and they have continued to the present."
1975.74-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.978,980.969,"Whom do you think is entitled to retroactive seniority, a class generally or is it someone who proves he was discriminated against and that he was qualified for a job and so on."
1975.74-728,0,35423,morris_j_baller,,980.969,989.975,"Mr. Justice White, in this case our class as defined by the District Court consists of individuals who applied and were rejected."
1975.74-728,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1597.529,1601.259,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-728,2,45814,william_m_pate,,2579.968,2584.157,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1975.74-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3001.618,3015.17,"Could you not argue precisely the opposite of that effect that there will not be much displacement or much defeat of expectations of people who are already there, so why not go ahead and give it."
1975.74-728,2,45814,william_m_pate,,3015.17,3041.354,"I think you could make that argument, yes, I think that you could, it would not make much difference either way and perhaps the argument could be made either way but I think it was a proper consideration for the District Court although he did not -- the Court did not say that it was relying on that consideration in any event on this point."
1975.74-728,3,35423,morris_j_baller,,3454.403,3456.329,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-728,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3619.31,3625.797,Mr. Baller if you loose under Title VII could you still prevail under 1981?
1975.74-728,3,35423,morris_j_baller,,3625.797,3627.793,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-728,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3677.073,3677.772,Thank you gentlemen.
