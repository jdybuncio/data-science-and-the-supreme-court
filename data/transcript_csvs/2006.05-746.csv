2006.05-746,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.305,We'll hear argument next in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorrell.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,7.577,11.329,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.351,109.754,"Except that the... what was it, the Rogers case, which said that the... well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,133.62,142.706,"Well, even if that were true, we would still, of course, be entitled to... I mean, it doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence."
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.048,147.869,But nobody does--
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,147.869,149.531,--The plaintiff would be.
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.881,179.859,"Mr. Phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,213.162,216.205,"That's not our attack, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.538,278.304,"I take it you would be satisfied... not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,285.53,289.374,"We would regard that as certainly at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.922,303.263,If we came out the way I just described--
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,303.263,303.934,You wouldn't have to address that issue.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.934,304.962,--We wouldn't have to.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,304.962,306.605,Absolutely don't have to address that issue.
2006.05-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,309.666,315.2,But I thought you argued the Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri court?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,315.2,318.251,"--We clearly did that, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.771,366.335,"Mr. Phillips, the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read,"
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,389.302,403.461,"No, what we're saying, Justice Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same... if they were going to use slight negligence with respect to our negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as well."
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.666,449.68,--Except we've rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,456.996,459.097,"Well, at least one circuit clearly."
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.097,470.293,"--Do you really expect to get five votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 years?"
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,470.293,475.756,"Well, I think the... well, the answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for that."
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.756,481.48,But you were wise enough not to ask for that.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,481.881,498.043,"But you know, the basic... the point here is that if you look at the decisions that have analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think any of them has analyzed it with much care."
2006.05-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.478,538.268,"Rogers said, in whole or in part."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,542.502,550.345,--But what Rogers saying in whole or in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation standard existing in Missouri.
2006.05-746,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.949,582.739,"Mr. Phillips, I may be lost a bit here."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,610.448,622.734,"Yes, that is a typical proximate cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're entitled to the equivalent instructions."
2006.05-746,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,626.687,627.138,Right.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,632.131,632.692,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.131,648.413,How is the blue brief in response to Respondent's argument?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,648.413,657.91,"--Because if you look at the opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on page 6,"
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.778,679.302,"As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,682.194,683.076,Yes.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.076,685.236,You object to 13.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,687.688,688.389,Yes.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.389,693.531,"You then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,717.797,718.578,"Right, we're arguing both."
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.578,718.949,All right.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,742.905,744.004,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.004,744.755,Yes?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,744.755,745.206,Yes.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.206,746.588,It says that in the blue brief?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,746.588,747.907,"Yes, it does say that in the blue brief."
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.895,765.329,"I would say it sure is before the Court, because what we are considering before the Court is your objection to instruction 13."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,773.626,774.796,That's fair.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.796,776.448,You're going to say yes.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,786.143,787.305,"Well, I don't know that it's--"
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.305,788.056,Causation.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,788.056,788.675,--I don't know that it's extraneous.
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.837,821.676,"Perhaps my memory is faulty, but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,858.892,861.263,"There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,876.523,880.564,But you didn't object to the charge that was given on negligence.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,885.379,893.083,--Except to the extent that the Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence.
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,938.234,946.528,You're not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroad's negligence.
2006.05-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,946.528,952.662,And I would add to that that we don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the Petitioner is presenting.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,952.662,956.144,"And you know, Justice Kennedy, I understand that."
2006.05-746,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,996.64,1004.888,So you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1008.989,1012.072,"--Well, because... courts of appeals have been doing that for years."
2006.05-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.08,1045.904,"Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this question."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1057.201,1057.832,Yes.
2006.05-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.832,1069.16,It seemed to me that a possible interpretation of the record... and I'd like you to comment of the record... is that the jury either believed the one... one truck driver or the other.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1092.354,1096.398,"Let me take the first question first, and then I'll address the second one."
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.724,1205.579,"I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is... perhaps a gloss put on it, but saying this: Look, we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldn't be different from the direct instruction... from the railroad instruction."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1209.843,1210.484,Correct.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.484,1220.501,"And we now want you to say that the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it violated the equivalence."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1226.396,1226.773,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.773,1233.128,"And if you stop there, probably, they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the right standard."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1233.128,1233.558,Correct.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.558,1245.186,"And if you really think about it, you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one that the court gave, is the right standard and should have been given in the other case, too."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1247.167,1247.788,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1247.788,1252.84,"But you're saying unless you say that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what happens in the future."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1253.411,1254.723,"You know, that's--"
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.723,1255.604,--Now let's think back for a minute on the merits.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1255.604,1256.824,--I'm sorry?
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1256.824,1258.086,How could it be wrong?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1269.764,1279.99,"Well, I think if we were entitled to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for and we should have properly received a proximate cause instruction."
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.93,1287.494,What possible... you have two sides.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1291.788,1292.297,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.297,1296.951,The other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1313.131,1316.172,"Well, it is not a correct statement of the law."
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1316.172,1316.553,All right.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1316.553,1317.384,Is the answer.
2006.05-746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.384,1320.296,"In other words, what the statute said it is not a correct statement of the law?"
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1320.296,1327.86,"Well, because it doesn't adequately explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go through in order to evaluate this case."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1339.077,1346.316,"Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on exactly the point that I think you're addressing with Justice Breyer?"
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1367.737,1368.536,--Right.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1368.536,1371.15,But it also does something else.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1394.008,1394.465,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1394.509,1394.465,--that that will suffice.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1430.048,1430.419,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1430.419,1438.032,"And therefore, if the plaintiff is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1447.79,1448.749,I--
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1448.749,1457.455,"So that to the extent the instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility that couldn't happen."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1475.887,1477.799,"--Well, I think it is wrong on two levels."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1495.982,1496.283,Okay.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1504.417,1506.307,What we asked for was an equivalence.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1506.307,1507.499,"Okay, and that... all right."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1527.131,1529.032,That was not the basis on which the judge rejected it.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1530.544,1536.178,"Well, maybe that was not the basis on which he rejected it, but if... we've got to consider it in deciding whether to reverse it."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1536.178,1541.222,"--Well, the point here that remains is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1544.752,1545.784,But that's not what he said.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1560.805,1563.056,"Well, that is the specific issue in this case."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.056,1565.516,"They don't have to have proximate, we don't have to have proximate."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1565.516,1565.817,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1566.598,1566.788,Okay.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1586.5,1590.924,"Well... I think... I think the argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly."
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1599.419,1602.882,You were entitled... your argument is you were entitled to an equivalent--
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1605.945,1606.786,--The slightest cause.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.786,1608.789,--proximate cause or no need to prove proximate cause.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1608.789,1609.049,Right.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1609.049,1610.01,That's your basic argument.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1610.01,1610.368,That's our basic argument.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1610.368,1610.639,Okay.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1610.639,1611.48,And we didn't get that.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1611.48,1622.187,"And I don't think you could have gotten where you want to go with the instruction that your side requested, which was an in whole or in part instruction."
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1623.238,1633.483,"Well, it may be that the in whole part of this may have been slightly misleading, although I think you can make an argument that you can end up with in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter."
2006.05-746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.136,1660.962,"What was wrong with the instruction, in your view of the case, that was given, instruction number 13, negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to cause his injuries?"
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1660.962,1662.445,Because that's proximate causation.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1666.986,1667.827,That's the direct language?
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1667.827,1668.188,Yes.
2006.05-746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.188,1668.578,Yeah.
2006.05-746,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1668.578,1670.361,I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
2006.05-746,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.361,1670.601,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1672.591,1687.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-746,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1738.655,1750.844,"Is the question whether instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether it is flawed when it's viewed together with the instruction on employer negligence?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1750.844,1763.092,"It is viewed in conjunction with the instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept of what it was, they did not challenge the language of instruction 12."
2006.05-746,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1792.261,1796.542,"But do you agree that they set out different causation standards, 12 and 13?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1796.542,1799.225,"Yes, they do."
2006.05-746,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1808.981,1815.745,"So if the causation standards are in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't that right?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1815.745,1827.925,"Yes, if you can reach that decision without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12 contained the exact language of the statute."
2006.05-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.395,1848.217,"Let me ask you this question, if I may."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1876.514,1884.732,"--There wasn't in the early 1900s for certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1899.071,1905.305,"Well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1922.295,1923.166,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1937.005,1937.436,Right.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,1952.696,1957.268,"--Well, the causation standard is used to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in the comparison."
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.694,1982.914,"Yeah, but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent... contributory negligence, that's not what we have here."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2032.338,2033.697,No.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.697,2034.258,Why not?
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2034.258,2036.319,It just affects which negligence was in the balance.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.859,2037.851,"No, it doesn't."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2046.387,2058.054,"--Well, in responding... going back to your question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's reply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of harms are considered proximately caused by intentional torts."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.077,2104.883,"You don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2118.442,2131.442,"Well, I think Justice Souter hit the nail on the head on that one, in that it does create confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as well."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.443,2132.964,"No, no."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2153.046,2155.457,"--Well, in--"
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2155.457,2160.791,You can answer it.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2160.791,2162.984,--I don't want to interrupt anybody.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.984,2167.556,"Answer the question, Justice Souter."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2169.226,2189.518,"The point that I was trying to make about it being misleading is that if you use the in whole or in part language for a contributory negligence instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking that at least there might be whole contributory negligence."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2203.84,2216.095,"Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2216.095,2226.453,"If petitioner had asked for an instruction that said directly contributed in part, the inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any impact."
2006.05-746,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.898,2250.949,"Well, two things you might comment on."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2270.081,2271.283,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2272.773,2275.864,"But that's what Justice Souter has identified, right?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2278.936,2282.088,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2285.571,2294.427,"Well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2297.65,2298.811,--That's one reason.
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.158,2326.61,"Well, no, no."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2437.242,2439.103,"I have two responses, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2442.285,2443.715,Absolutely right.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2443.715,2451.882,"And he, you know, definitely clearly said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common law proximate causation relying on Rogers."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.882,2465.179,"He did, but he was also pointing out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of... I forget the full name of it... the Appliance Act."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2516.834,2517.994,Yes.
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2539.098,2557.911,"Well, it is understood by everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception which is captured by using the word 13, and at least it has that core of meaning whenever it is used, doesn't it?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2571.979,2574.521,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2574.521,2574.911,Okay.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2587.49,2597.037,"We don't accept that, but even if that's the case, the Rogers... the parties to Rogers immediately interpreted that decision as affecting proximate cause."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.006,2612.115,That may be.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2618.42,2627.666,"Well, and I also think, though, that by lightening... by saying the slightest cause possible or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that does affect proximate cause."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2627.666,2630.577,You don't have to say that.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2658.537,2667.402,Because Section 53 refers to contributory negligence that created a bar.
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.958,2686.764,"Well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2686.764,2696.332,"But under Missouri procedures, you have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the objection was that we want the same language, we want the language resulting in whole or in part."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.927,2766.449,Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2766.449,2811.369,--That was a justification for rewriting instruction 13 to include the words
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.18,2824.206,"I guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with contributory negligence."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2827.901,2828.842,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.842,2839.348,"It just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2876.953,2883.828,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2884.509,2899.699,"Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now... perhaps in his minimalist position... might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2935.71,2938.672,--We disagree with petitioner.
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.672,2939.743,I'm not surprised.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2940.134,2944.906,The abstract question of equivalency--
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2944.906,2945.487,"No, no."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2946.488,2947.347,--Right.
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.347,2952.871,"It was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2976.487,2982.951,"Well, I think we're in a difficult position right now, because they're asking for proximate cause in their blue brief--"
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.951,2990.668,"Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the Court to say."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2990.668,2991.697,--Okay.
2006.05-746,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.288,2997.16,"If you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,2997.581,3016.193,"--But if the question goes to the fact that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional proximate cause, that Congress departed from the traditional proximate cause standard by using the words"
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.842,3032.265,Can you have more than one proximate cause?
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3032.265,3037.057,I believe the treatises that say yes.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.057,3037.748,Of course.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3056.148,3066.707,"Because when a cause that... when a slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3069.809,3074.472,"But it could be the slightest direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3074.472,3076.384,"Well, but if we look at like the first--"
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3076.384,3079.456,"Now, it may mislead the jury if that's all you say."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3096.886,3100.259,"--Well, no."
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.342,3125.476,How can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant?
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3135.96,3136.972,--Right.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.972,3147.749,So the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3147.749,3155.706,"Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight cause."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.507,3162.03,"That's what Rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3163.961,3166.281,--And neither did the instruction.
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.059,3195.833,It doesn't seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3198.414,3224.241,"The Restatement at the time of Rogers talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be so predominant that one causation is just not sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to constitute a legal cause."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3251.361,3267.581,"But under the old rule that plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar to recovery?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3267.581,3271.544,"I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3272.135,3272.475,I thought it was.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3273.547,3274.105,I am not aware of that.
2006.05-746,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3277.879,3278.289,That's what I thought.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3280.22,3288.785,"And clearly, Congress in this statute was trying to move away from the common law in many respects to protect the railroad worker."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.316,3308.938,"Why isn't ""in whole or in part"" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3322.357,3327.1,I reach that conclusion on the basis of Rogers.
2006.05-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.952,3343.843,"Beyond that, if the plaintiff's negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the... there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there would have been no negligence by the defendant."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3343.843,3344.512,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.512,3355.68,"That's why you don't have 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3355.68,3432.883,Even the petitioner's brief describes the language
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.135,3439.155,"It is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on, is it?"
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3443.92,3445.39,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2006.05-746,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3445.39,3451.523,I find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3464.954,3476.251,"Well, for Mr. Sorrell in particular, I mean, he acted, that he allowed that instruction to be used, and now they're attempting to disrupt this judgment."
2006.05-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.251,3481.854,I suppose employees have been under the rule for a long time.
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3481.854,3482.484,Yes.
2006.05-746,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3482.484,3486.916,"I suppose employee associations, workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied on it."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3486.916,3488.609,"Yes, you're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.462,3497.334,"Thank you, Ms. Perry."
2006.05-746,1,36504,mary_l_perry,,3497.334,3498.864,Thank you.
2006.05-746,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.864,3501.388,"Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining."
2006.05-746,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3501.388,3503.498,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-746,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3596.178,3607.778,"Would you have in your ideal instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?"
2006.05-746,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3607.778,3609.097,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-746,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3611.559,3612.059,Would you?
2006.05-746,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3612.059,3619.432,"--is that the guidance of the Court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to address that issue and to resolve it."
2006.05-746,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3620.734,3636.416,"But in your model instruction, in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?"
2006.05-746,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3636.416,3636.736,Yes.
2006.05-746,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3639.257,3650.375,"Even though almost universally, the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally incomprehensible to juries?"
2006.05-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3650.375,3653.606,"Let me ask this one very brief question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-746,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3664.532,3666.916,I think that would certainly go a long way.
2006.05-746,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.084,3674.955,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
