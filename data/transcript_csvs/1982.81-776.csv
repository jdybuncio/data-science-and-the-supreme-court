1982.81-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.806,We will hear arguments next in Brown against the Socialist Workers Campaign Committee.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,74.855,117.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the constitutionality of the provisions of Ohio's Campaign Expense Reporting Act, which requires campaign committees to file reports setting forth various information concerning their receipt and expenditure of campaign funds."
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,187.17,190.138,Is this just a factual argument then?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,190.138,192.121,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.854,197.18,To the facts.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,197.18,199.804,We are going to have to apply the facts to the law.
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.804,202.974,"But you don't claim the court used the wrong standard, legal standard."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,202.974,203.992,Absolutely not.
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.579,217.422,"Is this a question then, a mixed question of fact and law?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,217.422,220.92,It is one of those cases where it is a mixed question of fact and law because--
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.92,226.684,"Can we independently arrive at it, or do we have to find that the court was clearly erroneous?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,226.684,230.56,"--Not, I don't... you don't have to dispute any of the court's factual findings."
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.974,306.651,"The district court says, concludes, I infer from these historical facts which he has found, which you don't dispute, or nobody disputes about, I infer or predict that there would be reprisal or some injury in the future if there is disclosure."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,311.993,315.835,That is an application of this Court's standards to the facts in the case.
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.835,316.227,"Well, it is a finding."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,320.271,322.99,"That is correct, but that is the bottom line question."
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.99,323.442,"Well, is that--"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,323.442,324.771,Coming out of Buckley versus Valeo.
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.27,334.408,"--Well, I know, but there are a lot of bottom line findings that are still facts."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,339.859,345.56,--We are saying that the record considered as a whole does not support the finding made by the district court in this case.
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,444.096,446.705,Did you put on any evidence to say that it wouldn't happen again?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,446.705,448.093,"--Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.283,450.874,What kind of evidence was that?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,450.874,455.761,--We cited the Oregon case which contained references to affidavits--
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,455.761,458.228,I mean you know what the FBI is going to do next year?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,458.228,461.696,--I have a good feeling of what the FBI is not going to do next year.
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.696,462.725,That wasn't my question.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,467.132,467.927,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,471.537,473.003,I assume so.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,473.003,473.737,Okay.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.737,477.375,"General Brown, you mentioned the age of the evidence."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,487.514,488.7,1981.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,489.936,491.714,What happened during those six years?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,491.714,505.273,"I wasn't trial counsel, so I can't say with certainty what happened, but I think originally the TRO was entered on the premise that the case would be rapidly tried, and for various reasons, just like any lawsuit, it did not get rapidly tried."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.273,507.631,"Well, not just like any lawsuit, I hope."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,510.006,512.958,"We have had several cases in our office that took that long, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.19,516.55,Did they even convert it to a preliminary injunction?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,516.55,518.172,It was never converted.
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.402,538.29,"Well, that is clearly a violation of civil rules, if you would want to challenge it."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,541.943,544.552,"I certainly don't disagree with that, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,547.956,550.347,Was that done at the behest of opposing counsel?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,550.347,553.408,"Yes, they requested the temporary restraining order."
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.39,566.482,"Was it ever challenged on that ground, that the temporary restraining order was improperly--"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,566.482,570.277,"My predecessors in this case never challenged that, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.277,572.73,--They gave them total relief for six years.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,572.73,573.838,They most certainly did.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.042,578.899,"I guess the state really couldn't have been terribly upset about it, if they let it sit for six years."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,578.899,581.087,"--Well, the state is now terribly upset about it."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.087,581.726,Now it is upset.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,581.726,583.38,They didn't know at the time it was going to take six years.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.912,600.374,"I suppose the character of that order might have some relationship to the fact there is no evidence of any threats or harassment since 1975, or the people would be in contempt."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,600.374,617.289,"It has some relationship to no threats or harassments... because we weren't listing their identities, but it certainly doesn't detract from my argument that the FBI evidence is very, very stale and of no future probative value, which is my major evidentiary argument, and which I think is the key to this case."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.582,630.595,Do you know what the Senate is going to do tomorrow?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,630.595,636.717,"--I don't know what the Senate is going to do tomorrow, but I do know that the Senate committee found--"
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,636.717,637.953,"They are gone right now, you know."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,637.953,653.15,"--I do know, Justice Marshall, that the Senate found that the FBI did terminate its conduct and its misconduct vis-a-vis the Socialist Workers Party and its candidates and its party members in 1971."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.15,655.646,"Did the Senate say, and the FBI will never do it again?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,655.646,656.382,No.
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,657.708,658.987,"Well, I don't understand what your answer is."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,664.535,665.627,"--Justice Marshall, I--"
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,665.627,670.311,"The only truthful answer could possibly be, you don't know."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,670.311,671.703,--That is correct.
1982.81-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,671.703,677.56,Is there any evidence in this record that suggests any resumption of that kind of activity over the last ten years?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,677.56,699.284,"No, there is no evidence in this record to suggest resumption of the Cointelpro Program, which was the FBI's disruption and harassment program, which was specifically addressed to the Socialist Workers Party, directed to the Socialist Workers Party, and in the Oregon case there were affidavits submitted by the FBI which said that they had discontinued that program."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,731.351,733.195,You could have answered that 15 minutes ago.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,733.195,733.538,--Okay.
1982.81-776,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.304,790.638,"Mr. Brown, the Ohio statute requires two things, as I understand it, one a disclosure of contributions, contributors, names of contributors--"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,790.638,792.685,"In certain instances, not all of them."
1982.81-776,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,792.685,801.276,"--and secondly, disclosure of payment of expenditures to other people."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,801.276,802.898,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-776,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.898,825.297,"Was there any evidence in the record about the effect of requiring disclosure of the payments of expenditures to others, as opposed to evidence of harassment of members of the party, which presumably might include contributors?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,825.297,834.574,"Justice O'Connor, there is not one thread of evidence in this record presented by the appellees which showed any harassment of any recipient of an expenditure."
1982.81-776,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.742,886.211,Do you think the state's interest is different as between disclosure of expenditures and disclosure of contributors?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,886.211,888.411,"No, I don't think the state's interest is really different."
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.212,1016.424,"Mr. Brown, do you think the language in Buckley is addressed to any sort of harassment or bothering that might result from the fact of disclosure of persons of the statute or is it addressed more particularly to harassment that would be perpetrated by the entity, governmental entity requiring disclosure?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1016.424,1024.574,"Well, as I read the Buckley test, Your Honor, it creates a very... a reasonably loose standard."
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.742,1038.475,Yes.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1048.614,1051.815,"That's correct, and the Burrells case in 1934."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1236.129,1238.457,"Mr. Brown, can I back you up just a minute?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1249.922,1252.874,And the revival of this case?
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.874,1253.966,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1253.966,1259.901,"Well, it was a 1974 election, and this case was filed in 1974."
1982.81-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.41,1283.813,"I mean, I gather from what you say that you don't see any connection to it."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1292.311,1300.569,It is not a matter of connecting so much as a matter of arguing to this Court that a minority party is more than just a winner and a loser.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.974,1317.376,"General Brown, may I follow up on a question Justice O'Connor asked you a bit ago about the difference between the disclosure requirement with respect to contributions on the one hand and expenditures on the other?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1325.92,1327.168,That is basically correct.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.168,1334.839,"I didn't understand you to make that argument in your opening brief, and I am just wondering, was that squarely argued to the district court, that distinction between the two?"
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1334.839,1336.979,I don't know that it was squarely argued.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.175,1359.109,"But did they dispute it in the sense of saying, there isn't enough evidence to support any relief, and over and above that, there is absolutely no evidence on the expenditure part of it, which seems to me might well have been argued below."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1366.95,1370.246,"--There were post-trial briefs filed in this case, and it was argued--"
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.246,1370.995,You must have them.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1371.837,1372.356,--Yes.
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.852,1378.103,In your reply brief it is set out very--
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1378.103,1384.911,"In the post-trial briefs filed after the trial, yes, that was generally argued, that the statute is neither unconstitutional--"
1982.81-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.911,1387.614,--Post-trial before decision.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1387.614,1388.347,--Correct.
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.174,1407.981,"Well, at the trial stage, where the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove each and every element of their complaint, and they are seeking to strike down two different statutory sections, I suppose the burden is on the trial court if he is going to find for the plaintiffs to consider whether each one of those sections is unconstitutional."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1407.981,1410.575,That is the trial court's burden.
1982.81-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1410.575,1417.43,The law is presumed constitutional until someone presents a sufficient case to convince the court that it isn't.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1417.43,1438.218,"In this case, the trial court went through the evidence vis-a-vis contributors, and at the end of the trial court decision, it said, based upon the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, we conclude that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the SWP Party, both vis-a-vis contributions and expenditures."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.602,1457.35,"But I think there is a stronger statement on A-27, at the bottom of the page."
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1463.565,1465.299,"I may have missed that, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.299,1473.376,It says that it establishes in Ohio public disclosure that a person is a member of or has made a contribution which create a reasonable probability of harassment.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1475.22,1476.187,That's right.
1982.81-776,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1482.715,1484.279,The judgment itself you are referring to.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1487.871,1491.727,No determination as to facial validity?
1982.81-776,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1491.727,1492.913,Yes.
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1492.913,1504.845,"There was in the sense that the appellees in this case in their complaint asked that the statute be declared unconstitutional on its face, and the trial court refused to do that."
1982.81-776,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1511.845,1513.751,Specifically?
1982.81-776,0,25003,gary_elson_brown,,1513.751,1521.558,"It is not referenced, but it is a matter of fact it was denied, and the appellees had asked for it in their complaint, Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1612.444,1613.302,Very well.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1615.552,1646.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is about the right to exercise First Amendment freedom of association by contributing to the Socialist Workers Party election campaigns in Ohio without having the fact of that financial association or tie with the Socialist Worker Party candidates disclosed to the public."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.104,1684.024,What evidence is there in the record to support that?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1684.024,1692.084,"The facts in this case, Your Honor... we take exception to the Attorney General's statement of the facts in the case."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.248,1747.356,Was this in Ohio?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1747.356,1751.029,"The bullets, Your Honor, were in Pittsburgh, not in Ohio."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.029,1756.247,"Well, do you think that evidence in other states is uniformly transferrable to Ohio?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1756.247,1769.396,"Your Honor, the evidence from other states... there is no reason to suppose that attitudes in Ohio, we think, are any less hostile towards Socialist Workers Party adherents than they are anywhere else."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.545,1791.261,Where do we find that in the record?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1798.369,1798.993,All right.
1982.81-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1798.993,1802.96,How far is Pittsburgh from the Ohio line?

1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1905.605,1911.447,Well--
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1911.447,1924.928,Or is there a general inference that there are a certain percentage of abnormal people in a large country like this who will do abnormal things?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1924.928,1931.33,"--Well, some of the Presidents have lost their jobs, too, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.33,1942.012,I am putting my question to you about three attempts on Presidents' lives in just recent years.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1942.012,1962.752,"Well, the causes for events like that... when the shots were fired at the Socialist Workers Party meeting place, there wasn't any... no one prominent in that sense was present."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.576,1987.039,"Why do you suppose the efforts were made on three occasions... if you go back 20 years, it would be five or six occasions... on Presidents and Presidential candidates?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,1997.13,2010.232,"Well Your Honor, I think you can draw the inference that with respect, say, to the abnormal people, they are going to be directing their fire at people such as the Socialist Workers Party in inordinate numbers, since they are--"
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2010.232,2011.983,Or candidates for President.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2011.983,2017.451,"--They may be directing their fire at candidates for President, or Presidents."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.451,2029.087,"Or to leaders of other kinds, leaders of groups which some abnormal people find objectionable."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2029.087,2033.707,"Well, Your Honor, these people aren't leaders."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.109,2054.029,"Your point would be, I suppose, that they attract more violence than similarly situated Republicans and Democrats."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2054.029,2054.887,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.904,2060.26,"Well, that is hardly borne out by the records, is it?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2060.26,2063.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2065.009,2076.879,The three attempts on Republican Presidents and successful activities towards the Democratic candidates and one President.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2081.952,2091.732,"The targets here were not as prominent as the victims of those Republican and Democratic attacks, those major party victims."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.059,2142.243,"Mr. Buckley, the offices, I take it, would be attacked quite apart from any disclosure requirement."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2159.328,2160.298,"None at all, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.174,2232.078,"Of course, in a sense, it was something that you brought about yourself."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2242.228,2256.94,"--Well, Your Honor, in Buckley against Valeo, we think that that opinion invited exactly this sort of a lawsuit to be brought when there was evidence based upon past or present harassment of members, and it doesn't require that there be a direct cause and effect relationship."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.94,2260.798,Why do you say it doesn't require it to be a direct cause and effect relationship?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2264.049,2268.156,"Well, it talks about flexibility in proof, evidence of--"
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.156,2271.545,That still doesn't go to what it is you are trying to prove.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2271.545,2286.492,"--It would require people to be harassed, to expose themselves in this First Amendment area to dangerous consequences on account of--"
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.492,2291.6,How would you produce evidence of harassment other than showing that somewhere there has been the fact of harassment?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2291.6,2307.31,"--Well, we do have some evidence of harassment, that 1973 incident, and there is another one in the record as well in which the Government Accounting Office gave people some trouble when they... That is in Exhibit 129, both those episodes, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.31,2319.731,"Do you think that we could... well, what do you think our standard of review is in this case?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2319.731,2322.164,"The clearly erroneous standard applies here, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.243,2328.193,"What is the factual determination, that there will... it is a prediction?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2328.193,2335.675,"That there is a reasonable probability that if names are disclosed, it will subject the people to threats, harassment, or reprisals."
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.75,2345.842,That certainly isn't a historical fact finding.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2349.546,2354.589,It is based upon historical facts.
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.589,2355.15,"Well, it may be."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2358.414,2359.416,It is not just a foreboding.
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.099,2379.034,So you think we can't disagree with the inferences the three-judge court drew unless we find the inference is clearly erroneous.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2379.034,2380.609,"--Your Honor, what we--"
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.609,2387.719,We can't make an... you submit that we can't make an independent judgment--
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2387.719,2388.53,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.53,2392.293,--based on the historical facts as to what the future might hold.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2392.293,2401.726,--Rule 52 says that the findings in matters like this of the trial court should not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.

1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2429.841,2438.525,"There is no evidence in the record on expenditures either, Your Honor, because with no disclosure--"
1982.81-776,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.525,2447.99,"Well, there is some limited evidence, is your argument, as to the effect on contributors, but is there any at all on the expenditures?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2447.99,2464.075,"--There is none at all on expenditures as such, but in that connection, we think that the considerations when it comes to disclosure of who gets the money, where the disbursements go, are very similar to the considerations that go into the contributors' names."
1982.81-776,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.075,2465.872,"Well, don't you think they are really quite different?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2484.38,2490.206,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and the case of Peter Zenger comes to mind in that connection."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2504.278,2510.182,"Wouldn't even you concede that the case of Peter Zenger is somewhat remote in time and place, though?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2510.182,2515.401,"It is remote in time and place, but I think it is appropriate nevertheless, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.401,2519.039,"He wasn't doing commercial printing, either."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2532.612,2538.547,"Well, a good deal of what appeared in Peter Zenger's journal was published anonymously."
1982.81-776,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2548.464,2567.237,"Mr. Buckley, would you concede that the state might have conceivably even a greater interest in requiring disclosure of expenditures than contributions in an effort to discourage the payment of bribes or buying votes, or something of that kind?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2567.237,2571.393,"I wouldn't see that that is any greater interest, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.179,2641.362,"Did the district court in its opinion rely on, for instance, the 1978 document?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2641.362,2645.02,"Well, it relied on the totality of the circumstances, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.02,2648.019,"Well, it mentions several pieces of evidence specifically, as I recall."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2649.672,2651.97,"It does not mention that, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.767,2710.243,"But it is true that in an equity case decided as of the time the judgment is entered and as of this moment, is it not true that there is not one iota of evidence that the FBI or any other government agency is doing anything against them?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2710.243,2712.368,"Well, Your Honor, that's--"
1982.81-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.368,2714.631,Is it or is it not true?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2719.567,2724.878,"--It's... Let me answer you this way, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.878,2729.047,"No, no, you will answer my question yes or no."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2729.047,2735.606,There is an inference that federal hostility toward the Socialist Workers Party continues.
1982.81-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.805,2790.007,Even if they haven't been engaging in any such activity?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2790.007,2805.204,"Well, the record shows that they were investigating, they had an interest and were investigating the Socialist Workers Party, and the evidence comes all the way down to the fall... to a few months before trial, actually."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2859.149,2887.499,"Mr. Buckley, supposing that in a Presidential year, there is a very hotly fought battle between the Republican candidate and the Democratic candidate for President, and let's say in a particular Congressional district in Ohio the thing is even more hot, and it is just a very bitter, hostile rivalry, with a lot of rock-throwing, things you don't ordinarily see in strictly major party campaigns, but this is a little bit different."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2899.446,2906.801,"Well, Your Honor, it might theoretically be possible."
1982.81-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2930.09,2932.277,"Well, what about Pollard against Roberts?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2932.277,2938.275,"Justice Blackmun, there is no question but that the--"
1982.81-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2938.275,2939.523,That was a Republican candidate.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2939.523,2940.024,--That was a Republican.
1982.81-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2950.706,2952.878,I just don't want you to give up so easily.
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,2952.878,2973.806,Let me explain why this case took so long to get here.

1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3046.853,3048.9,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.403,3121.809,"That doesn't necessarily follow, does it, counsel?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3143.017,3154.826,"But, Your Honor, the people who become landlords for the Socialist Workers Party deliberately choose to deal with them, and they might very well not want it to be known that that is where they were making their money."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.23,3163.151,"Well, I suppose any landlord deliberately chooses, but do you think it is exactly the same sort of choice as making a voluntary contribution to a political party?"
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3163.151,3171.805,I suggest that it would be harmful to many people if it were known that they were making their money by dealing with the Marxist ideologists.

1982.81-776,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.907,3182.953,That is exactly the point.

1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.308,3210.788,"Well, your argument about contributors, though, is that the Socialist Workers Party will be damaged because contributors will be put off."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3216.817,3220.955,"--It is a party's interest, Your Honor, but there are other kinds of--"
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.955,3224.952,"Well, I know, but whose interests are you representing here, the Socialist Workers Party?"

1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.622,3238.697,"All right, their contributors, but the only reason you can represent the contributors is because it might cool them off to have their names disclosed."
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3246.804,3247.927,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.476,3255.317,"You mean, you can't find a landlord, or you can't find... of course, everybody is going to know who your landlord is."

1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3262.438,3266.201,"--It would deter such people, Your Honor, but there are other kinds of recipients as well."

1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.151,3306.105,Who do you pay to get the postage?
1982.81-776,1,42449,thomas_d_buckley_jr,,3308.133,3317.132,"Well, you pay somebody to go and buy that, Your Honor, and that is what... you have to say, to whom paid, and the purpose of the expenditure."
1982.81-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3318.458,3320.568,Do you buy stamps through a middleman?

1982.81-776,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3621.119,3628.894,"Mr. Brown, time-wise, where does the line of demarcation come?"
1982.81-776,2,25003,gary_elson_brown,,3635.972,3642.094,"Justice Blackmun, there is no way for me to stand here and say there is a definite way to draw that time line."
1982.81-776,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3670.283,3672.596,"Well, suppose it is three years ago."
1982.81-776,2,25003,gary_elson_brown,,3672.596,3681.749,"Well, like I say, there is no way to definitely draw the line, but the further you go back into the past, the less likely it has any current probative value."
1982.81-776,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3681.749,3686.104,So your position is that it has to be unreasonable here.
