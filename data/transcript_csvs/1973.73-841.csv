1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,0.0,11.842,"We'll now hear number 73-841, Holder versus Banks."
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,11.842,13.145,Mr. Justice Douglas.
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,13.145,13.886,Mr. Stipher?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,13.886,16.653,May it please the Court.
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,307.485,310.774,"Made at various times and places, were they?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,310.774,320.119,They where to -- some of the statements were made at the meeting at Indiana State University at Terre Haute where the case was pending.
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.702,344.229,"There they are all made in public, were they?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,344.229,345.1,"Oh, yes."
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,345.1,347.952,And during what period?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,347.952,359.656,"They were made prior to April 1, 1972 when there was a hearing before Judge Holder to determine whether or not this man should be permitted to represent the defendant."
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,359.656,365.532,The incident in the prison occurred in December of 1971?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,367.108,371.208,"August of 1971, 1972, Your Honor."
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,371.208,373.699,And then when was the charge brought against in the internal judge?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,373.699,375.908,"December 14, 1972."
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,375.908,384.779,"December 1972, that was the charge and then there are some difference of opinion as to when Mr. Kunstler was retained, isn’t it?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,384.779,385.338,Yes.
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.063,418.159,Before the charge was brought?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,418.159,419.788,Right.
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.788,424.325,"And these statements, these various statements, remained you say they are all made in public?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,424.325,427.726,"Yes, in public before the groups that I’ve been indicated to you."
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.042,441.392,"I see, so they are -- and when was the earliest statement they ever made?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,442.391,451.222,"Well, I think the statements were made generally from the first of the year up until the January until April 1972."
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.222,453.987,"Now, due to Indiana audiences?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,453.987,459.728,"Yes, audiences in Indianapolis and in Terre Haute."
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.371,639.432,"Now by the content of those statements you just read, they apparently were made after Mr. Kunstler was denied the right appear for --"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,639.432,641.35,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.324,645.172,So they couldn’t been the reason for the denial?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,645.172,655.237,But I believe that they are relevant pertinent in this case because the action of mandamus that was filed in the Court of Appeal was the original action.
1973.73-841,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,678.614,688.632,"Well, I suppose Judge Holder’s findings were, his prediction was what will happen to the future if he allowed Mr. Kunstler to represent Mr. Banks not if you denied the right."
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,688.632,694.887,"Well, I think that was further basis for his findings."
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.54,970.395,"Now, is it your position that or would your position be the same if the Judge had refused to permit a member of the Indiana Bar to represent Mr. Banks?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,970.395,974.519,"That’s it, Your Honor, I think we’re all to be treated the same oneness."
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.041,997.449,Do you think as a matter of -- just as a matter of however a District Judge has a power to eject from his Courtroom an attorney who violates the Canon of Ethics over the objection of his client?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,997.449,1000.692,"Yes, I do Judge and let me say the way --"
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.692,1009.083,And so that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was conditioned upon the counsel of his choice complying with the Canons of Ethics
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1009.083,1012.083,That is right and we have got cases that support it.
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.083,1012.711,That case is not the issue.
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1012.711,1018.209,That is -- well that’s one issue and then other issue about these statements whether or not they are in the violation of the Fifth Amendment?
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.209,1021.201,The Court of Appeals answered that question the other way?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1021.201,1026.877,"Yes, and we think Court of Appeals was wrong and here we think that Court of Appeals was wrong in the Oliver case."
1973.73-841,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.61,1113.983,"It may be so but it didn’t in -- that case didn’t suggest that if a lawyer violated an order against making statements about a case, that the lawyer could be disqualified from representing the defendant."
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1113.983,1122.112,"I think what the case means to me and you will have to write on it to see what it means, but I’ll tell you what it means to me Judge."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.088,1140.148,What did Judge Holder do other than to say that this man couldn’t represent him?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1143.867,1148.417,At a hearing Judge to determine whether or not he had violated Rule 27.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.417,1155.912,"Well, you say that Sheppard says you had protect the crowd, prevent publicity etcetera."
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1157.791,1160.56,"No, just because our rule does that?"
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.36,1172.741,But did he at anytime say anything to Mr. Kunstler other than you can’t come in?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1172.741,1175.0,He had a hearing Judge and as a result of this hearing --
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.0,1176.63,I know you had a hearing --
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1176.63,1176.683,Right.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.683,1183.63,It's concluded from the hearing that the best way to stop this is to kept this man up.
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1183.63,1186.003,"No, there were no other orders issued with respect to this."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.003,1188.841,"Well, he could have, couldn’t it he?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1188.841,1190.321,"Yes, Your Honor but--"
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.321,1191.695,But he didn't.
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1191.695,1191.719,He did not.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1191.719,1202.643,"Look at this way and while I interrupted with you, so far as you know is he still Mr. Banks choice, as his lawyer?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1202.643,1204.075,"Judge, I don’t know."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1205.814,1209.531,"Well, do you know if there is any change in the situation?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1209.531,1210.233,I do not --
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.233,1212.389,So far as you he is still there?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1212.389,1213.084,Right.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.084,1220.602,"Now, what happens to the Constitution which says that he is entitled to the lawyer of his choice?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1220.602,1225.411,"Well, I do not think the Constitution has the words of his choice Judge."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1227.493,1229.17,You think you find some decisions that are --
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1229.17,1230.932,Alright maybe so.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.852,1271.108,"Well, I don’t -- that binds me, the decision in New Jersey binds me?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1271.108,1280.517,"Well, I think it is a very good decision and besides that Judge, I think we have other cases that we’ve cited in here."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.517,1284.138,We also had the Seventh Circuit?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1284.138,1285.117,In this case?
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.117,1285.727,Yes.
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1285.727,1287.422,Which I think is wrong.
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.306,1334.252,Is that has been approved by this Court?
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1334.252,1338.858,"The rules well, only insofar as the Judicial Conference had approved."
1973.73-841,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.858,1342.65,"It's persuasive, that is all, right?"
1973.73-841,0,33999,karl_j_stipher,,1342.65,1346.425,I want to make my position clear.
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1556.508,1566.389,Thank you very much Your Honor.
1973.73-841,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1566.389,1572.534,Mr. Stavis?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1572.534,1576.199,"Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court."
1973.73-841,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1610.636,1613.004,The underlying question Federal protection.
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1613.004,1614.658,"That is right, sir."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1656.232,1658.913,What is the issue without going into detail?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1658.913,1668.467,"The issue was among other things with respect to the prior incarcerations, Mr. Banks had been kept in solitary confinement for approximately 18 months."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.467,1672.145,"But the issue has not in a deal with Mr. Kunstler representation there, hasn’t he?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1672.145,1675.457,None whatsoever.
1973.73-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1675.658,1680.168,His involvement Mr. Stavis has no bearing on the issue we haven't decided here?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1680.168,1684.321,I don’t believe -- I don’t believe they do accepting with respect to one question.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1829.405,1832.43,"They are different Districts, Judicial Districts?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1832.43,1834.125,Different divisions within Districts —
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.125,1835.605,Different divisions of the same District?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1835.605,1841.062,That is right and separate jury laws and we refer to that if we cited enough --
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1841.062,1844.563,You’re not talking about Exhibit A on Page 1a of your Appendix to your brief?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1844.563,1845.516,That’s right.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.018,1932.795,Exhibit B was published where?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1932.795,1933.623,I’m sorry sir --
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.623,1935.13,It's alright.
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1936.839,1937.196,Yes.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.196,1939.397,Where was that published?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1939.397,1941.147,There’s no proof as to where it was published.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1951.703,1952.429,There is no --
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1952.429,1964.357,"There is no proof whatsoever in this record that a copy of this in ever got into Terre Haute, Indiana or that any portion of this ever got to a newspaper which is published in Terre Haute Indiana."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.357,1966.109,How do they get in the record?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,1966.109,1971.379,The Judge said “I’ve got this and hand it to the Government counsel.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.93,2163.224,"Further there was a rule 27, is that number of the rule?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2163.224,2165.299,"Yes, there was a rule 27."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.299,2172.608,And we were told earlier by counsel that that rule has a counterpart in every District Court?
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2172.608,2173.781,I believe that to be the case.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.781,2174.748,In the contrary --
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2174.748,2176.748,I believe that’s to be the case.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.748,2185.058,"And presumably a lawyer whose even if he hadn’t practice before in this District Court would know about that rule, wouldn’t he?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2185.058,2187.797,Yes!
1973.73-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2251.512,2259.656,"Mr. Stavis, just submission that Rule 27 is not operative without this advanced finding in the Seventh Circuit?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2259.656,2274.853,That is our submission and that was the finding in holding of the Seventh Circuit both in Chase against Robson and again repeated by its holding in this particular case.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.853,2288.365,You referred to a colloquy between I think I understood to this that you referred to a colloquy between Mr. Kunstler and judge Holder about that Seventh Circuit case --
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2288.365,2289.507,"Oh, yes."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.507,2290.943,"That’s in your brief, somewhere I think?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2290.943,2291.402,"Oh, yes."
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.402,2294.613,"Find it out, I remember reading it when I have think about that --"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2294.613,2299.265,But I think you will find it on page 19.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.265,2302.93,Thank you.
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2302.93,2304.722,It starts from the bottom of Page 18.
1973.73-841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.302,2327.71,Thank you.
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2327.71,2351.765,"Now, hang up with those questions, I would like at this point to turn, turn other aspect of our argument and that is that two days after the -- Mr. Banks filed this petition for writ of mandamus with the Seventh Circuit."
1973.73-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2573.564,2583.841,"Excuse me Mr. Stavis, does the record show anything of the practice either in Judge Holder’s Court or generally in that District Court of admission to the Attorney’s pro hac vice?"
1973.73-841,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2583.841,2585.945,There is nothing in the record with respect to that.
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3474.319,3475.072,May it please the Court.
1973.73-841,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.775,3490.523,Lawyers come here all the time and ask this or ask on all the broad questions of the universe.
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3494.043,3504.551,But in this case we do have this Rule 27 and it has quite a history to it and as I mentioned before it was set down in the Sheppard case that the Courts ought to adopt the Rules.
1973.73-841,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.52,3530.25,Did you -- I don’t see that the Court of Appeal has said or even held that it is proper improper to disqualify attorney for violating Rule 27?
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3530.25,3533.211,Well --
1973.73-841,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.211,3535.018,Was that a reason given by (Voice Overlap) --
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3535.018,3547.142,"That was part of the finding, parts of his findings that Kunstler had violated Rule 1F which incorporates the Canons of Ethics of the American Bar and Rule 27."
1973.73-841,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.142,3551.479,But that doesn’t seem to be the issue that the Court of Appeals thought was presented to them?
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3551.479,3560.434,"Well, we thought that the Court of Appeals tried to dodge the issues in the case to be very frank and tried to put the first opinion as they did purely on the matter of waiver."
1973.73-841,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3569.228,3573.926,And they still didn’t face up the issue you -- that you say you are really representing?
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3573.926,3597.672,"Well, I think not, but all I’m saying is that we believe the issue was in the case and they dodged it and I think, it is in the record in this case, and I think the two important constitutional questions here about violation of the Sixth Amendment or whether you're entitled to a lawyer of your own choice by Sixth Amendment in violation of the First Amendment are involved in this case and I would ho --"
1973.73-841,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3597.672,3606.437,Let me go Mr. Stipher with the last paragraphs of the opinion on the rehearing.
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3624.109,3626.362,"Well, we disagree with Court of Appeals on that."
1973.73-841,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.254,3647.646,"Now, if we -- I suppose to -- we must disagree with them on this record than to reverse?"
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3647.646,3655.264,I think you’re going to have to look at the record to see whether the questions that we raised are presented by the record.
1973.73-841,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3727.829,3731.384,Was that the prevailing opinion Mr. Stipher?
1973.73-841,2,33999,karl_j_stipher,,3731.384,3734.368,"No, it was a dissenting opinion."
1973.73-841,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3746.02,3747.868,Thank you gentlemen.
