1962.41,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.26,"Number 41, Lenore Foman, Petitioner, versus Elvira A. Davis, Executrix."
1962.41,0,35425,milton_bordwin,,14.539,18.705,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Your Honors and may it please the Court."
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,1555.666,1560.619,May it please the Court.
1962.41,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1727.573,1730.935,"Mr. Shaine, (Inaudible)"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,1730.935,1732.252,"Yes, I was."
1962.41,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1732.252,1739.846,Have you ever (Inaudible)
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,1739.846,1749.453,"Now, the counsel is correct in that the intimation of this issue was first made by one of the Court of Appeals."
1962.41,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1749.453,1756.735,And you regard yourself as being in the Court of Appeals and comment on (Inaudible)
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,1756.735,1760.816,That is correct.
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2446.896,2450.841,Why did the District Court deny that motion to amend?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2450.841,2473.153,"This Your Honor, is the key to the appellee's point on this and that I believe explains the position of the Court of Appeals, that the argument before the District Court, defendant raised the inadequacy of the motion to amend in this respect."
1962.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2485.863,2488.735,You're still referring to the use of defendant instead of decedent?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2488.735,2491.064,That is correct.
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.794,2519.41,What is the dilemma?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2519.41,2523.19,The original complaint Your Honor.
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2523.19,2527.374,I mean in this amendment -- second amendment complaint on page 10.
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2530.478,2535.115,It says that in paragraph 2 --
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.115,2535.733,"Yes, what's wrong with that?"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2535.733,2540.453,"The defendant, that's Elvira A. Davis."
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2605.354,2615.815,"Well, I don't quite understand Mr. Shaine, this -- does this go to the merits on the appeal, what's this got to do with the issue before us whether it was proper to dismiss this (Inaudible)"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2615.815,2627.94,"Well, the appellant, Your Honor, claims that the District Court abused its discretion in denying that motion to amend by setting forth this second cause of action."
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2627.94,2632.457,"Oh, you mean this is a second point in addition to the one on the rule?"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2632.457,2632.469,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2632.469,2633.261,Is that it?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2633.261,2634.764,Yes.
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2647.928,2651.497,"Yes, that's the -- it's the support point raised from these questions presented, is that (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2651.497,2652.868,That's right sir.
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2687.985,2697.049,"But I gather Mr. Shaine, if we think the Court of Appeals is wrong in dismissing the appeal, we don't have to reach this (Inaudible) --"
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2697.049,2698.316,I would say that's true.
1962.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.316,2703.962,That's in the merits in the appeal including this point I would suppose that this were before the Court of Appeals.
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,2703.962,2709.902,"Although, Your Honor, perhaps I'm not doing justice to the appellant in that respect."
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3039.623,3046.524,(Inaudible) he followed the dissenting opinion in the Court of that -- at that time?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,3046.524,3056.123,"The view of Judge Ford, it does happen, coincided with the minority view expressed in Cleaves against Kenny."
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3056.123,3058.479,Quoted from it did he not as calling it what might be (Voice Overlap) --
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,3058.479,3058.987,"Yes, he did."
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3058.987,3060.195,-- for what?
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,3060.195,3061.033,"Yes, he did."
1962.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3131.049,3142.548,"But we do have a situation, do we not, where he has expressly refused the problem, a clear opinion in contrary to what he decides."
1962.41,1,40491,roland_e_shaine,,3142.548,3167.216,"Your Honor, I would ask that Judge Ford's opinion be read with consideration of the fact that he is the trial judge who is disposing of these matters as part of litigation and that his whole memorandum decision must be read as a whole."
1962.41,2,35425,milton_bordwin,,3414.496,3416.809,Just three small points.
