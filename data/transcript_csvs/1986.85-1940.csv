1986.85-1940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1940, United States versus Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma."
1986.85-1940,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,13.058,21.663,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1970, this Court decided the case of Choctaw Nation versus Oklahoma."
1986.85-1940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.03,485.698,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,487.714,496.804,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.66,601.622,"That may be true, Mr. Wilcoxen, but your opponent suggests that our cases are virtually larded with statements that the exercise of the navigational servitude is not a taking of property even from people because they had no compensable interest."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,603.923,626.355,"That is correct, Your Honor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but the cases relied upon by the United States are cases where riparian owners have acquired whatever rights that the States got and it was intended in those situations and always was intended that those grants be subject to the public right of passage."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.58,649.637,Why should it be different in this one case of a patent to the Cherokee Nation as opposed to all of the streambeds that have gone to the states under the equal footing doctrine?
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,649.637,652.087,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.087,668.266,"Well, countless streambeds have gone to the states of the Union upon their admission on the basis of the equal footing doctrine, so that there are numerous states that are situated similarly to the Cherokee Tribe here."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,673.17,680.59,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that the equal footing doctrine would not apply as a limitation to the Cherokee Nation."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.59,692.464,"I am not suggesting it did, but the equal footing doctrine, our cases have held, give the states fee title to land underlying riverbeds certainly every bit as much as the Cherokee got."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,697.666,716.128,"Because I think it was clearly intended as this country grew westward that those navigable lands be and remain public highways, and I think that the intent in the grant, the patent to the Cherokee Nation was that it be a private domain for the Cherokee people and was not intended to be a technical title."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.864,724.483,I am not talking about a riparian owner.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,733.922,738.557,"Well, that is a good question, Your Honor."
1986.85-1940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.034,785.938,"But that doesn't mean that it isn't subject to navigational servitude, though."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,785.938,789.759,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't see how--"
1986.85-1940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.759,791.376,"It just doesn't follow, does it?"
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,791.376,816.826,"--To me I don't see how the United States can maintain its trust responsibility to the tribe especially in the face of an express provision of trust and take and use this property for a very public purpose, and that is to build a navigation way in the face of the plain provisions of the Act of 1906."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.082,936.169,"Well, it is one thing, though, for the Cherokee Nation to be able to exclude traders and people like that."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,939.121,947.977,"Your Honor, I am not trying to say that the Cherokee Nation is excluding the United States."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.313,1195.615,But that is true in any number of the other navigational servitude cases.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1208.256,1216.944,"But I think in those cases, Your Honor, those individuals took with the expectation that their property would be shared with the public right."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.944,1223.032,Everybody takes with the expectation that the government will exercise its navigational servitude.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1223.032,1223.865,I don't think--
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.865,1225.384,Our cases have said that.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1225.384,1237.358,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but this is a unique case where the Cherokees had a separate domain, and I don't think it was the intent of Congress that their lands be shared with the public."
1986.85-1940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.981,1395.577,"If the Corps of Engineers wants to do something about flood control within the reservation or within that stretch of the river they are going to have to... if they are going to take any of the banks or anything like that, straighten out the river, they are going to have to pay."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1395.577,1399.012,"That would be our position, Justice White."
1986.85-1940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.964,1414.141,And so it depends on the... they are going to have to pay or get the consent of the tribe in order to protect people below.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1414.141,1418.842,I am not saying that the tribe could prevent the Corps of Engineers from using the property.
1986.85-1940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.842,1419.142,No.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1422.294,1423.496,That's correct.
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.637,1448.029,Why isn't the logic of your argument that there should be no power in the federal government to alter these streams to improve navigation at all?
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1470.024,1470.741,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.741,1475.012,"Now all of a sudden you are changing this treaty and you are making it, you know, money instead of lands."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1476.895,1483.117,"Well, in the past this Court has held that the Cherokee Nation is subject to this country's power of eminent domain."
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.117,1489.271,"I know we have, but that... I am talking about the logic of your argument."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1500.31,1504.364,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.768,1518.838,"The logic coming the other way is that if the Cherokee Nation is subject to eminent domain, it is subject to the navigational servitude."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1518.838,1537.501,"--I would say, Your Honor, in answer to that that it would not be fair in the face of the plain promises made in the treaties and the way the Indians would have understood them to invoke the servitude in such a way that it takes property from the tribes without compensation."
1986.85-1940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.501,1547.957,Wasn't it conceded in the Choctaw Nation case that the government retained a navigational servitude in the river?
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1547.957,1563.403,"Yes, Your Honor, it was stated in the Choctaw Nation case that the United States had all it was concerned with in retaining its navigational easement pursuant to its constitutional power to regulate navigation."
1986.85-1940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1574.258,1576.543,You are certainly disavowing that concession today.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1576.543,1577.176,--Excuse me?
1986.85-1940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.176,1580.828,"You are disavowing that concession today, clearly."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1580.828,1585.916,Well--
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.916,1587.332,Not really.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1589.201,1597.807,"--I am saying that to the extent that it would divest property interests of the Cherokee Nation that they thought that they had, that compensation is due."
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.809,1916.577,"Well, the question is really whether there is property to be taken."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1933.67,1935.372,"That is correct, Justice Scalla."
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.372,1960.654,"Now, it seems to me that the problem you confront is that in all other instances it is... in all other instance it is assumed that when the federal government conveys property, even when it conveys fee title, it does not convey that little bit that consists of its right to deepen the bed of the stream or otherwise improve navigation."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,1985.071,1994.827,"But this truly is a unique case that they granted an Indian tribe fee simple title to navigable lands, to lands below a navigable river."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.827,1996.612,It isn't unique at all.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2007.968,2018.424,"That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but it is clearly intended under those circumstances that those be and remain public highways."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.424,2020.942,Why is it intended there and not in this case?
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2020.942,2025.394,Because the Cherokee Nation was set aside in a separate domain.
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.547,2049.295,"Well, you know, I dare say everyone who gets a patent from the United States thinks and does get fee simple, if that is what the patent says, with all the bundle of rights that includes and yet every other patent is subject to the navigational servitude, and you are insisting that this somehow stands by itself."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2049.295,2062.436,"Well, I am saying, your Honor, that there are circumstances in which there can be created compensable property rights, and I think that the Cherokee Nation in the face of its history has a compensable property interest in the riverbed."
1986.85-1940,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.436,2071.891,"In a way there is even less reason to think that the federal government was giving it all away here, that navigational servitude that it holds."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2087.15,2119.122,"There were some appropriations to study the river and to remove snags in the river, but I must say, Your Honor, that that primarily took place below Fort Smith, while some of that did come into this area, but I don't think that the removal of those snags for the primary purpose of allowing navigation to Fort Gibson to supply the fort and even to allow trading with the Cherokee Nation obviates the fact that there was clearly intended to set aside a private domain for the Cherokee Nation."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.215,2144.154,"In expelling or keeping the settlers out the tribe had the support of the United States, did it not?"
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2144.154,2145.588,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.588,2153.759,"Well, now, here the United States is on the other side, and so the question is, how much of that muscle was the tribe's and how much of it was the United States'."
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2153.759,2163.734,"Well, both entities had their own provisions to keep the intruders out."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.17,2200.324,What if the United States had wanted to march a troop of cavalry through the reservation.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2203.609,2216.5,"Well, whether or not the United States marched cavalry through the Cherokee Nation, I think that would be an entirely separate situation than if 200 American citizens just simply wanted to come and sojourn on the Cherokee Nation."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.5,2218.202,I am sure it would be.
1986.85-1940,1,33621,james_wilcoxen,,2225.19,2241.901,"We think that Congress intended that the Cherokees have every reasonable beneficial economic value which can be derived from the riverbed, including water power."
1986.85-1940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.225,2309.177,"Thank you, Mr. Wilcoxen."
1986.85-1940,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2311.31,2314.712,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.619,2328.221,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
