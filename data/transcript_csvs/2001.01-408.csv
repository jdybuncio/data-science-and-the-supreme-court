2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.086,"We'll hear argument in next No. 01-408, The Holmes Group v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.-- Mr. Dabney."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,22.086,36.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of the regional circuits."
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.219,104.768,"Well, Congress did want patent law to be uniform, didn't it?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,104.768,105.883,Congress--
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.883,110.053,"I mean, that's why it placed the jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,110.053,117.65,"--One... Mr.... Your Honor, one of the Congress' objectives in establishing the Federal Circuit certainly was--"
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.65,125.202,"And to the extent that you then allow the other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims, you're defeating that uniformity goal."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,125.202,142.17,"--Your Honor, the Congress in enacting 1295, according to this Court in Christianson, establishes not that every case in which a Federal patent claim is raised automatically goes to the Federal Circuit."
2001.01-408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.808,182.987,"Mr. Dabney, has the Federal Circuit held that whenever there's a patent claim in a... in a... a patent issue in a counterclaim, it has jurisdiction?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,185.35,191.787,"The Federal Circuit has held in the DSC Communications case that permissive or compulsory, it doesn't matter."
2001.01-408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.787,193.002,It doesn't matter.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.002,193.812,But in this case--
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.812,194.638,"--In this case, it was compulsory."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,195.214,199.672,"Your Honor, it is far from clear that the counterclaim in this case was in fact compulsory."
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.3,222.063,But did... did the court of appeals say in this case that the... the counterclaim was compulsory?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,222.063,223.533,--The court of appeals did not say that.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.678,227.37,We're not talking about the trade dress claim.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,233.397,243.8,--The respondent has taken the position that the patent counterclaim that it filed in this particular case was compulsory within the meaning of rule 13.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.803,253.087,Did it not arise out of the same transaction and occurrence which under the rules is interpreted broadly?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,253.087,260.685,"--The subject matter of that counterclaim was, at the time it was filed, the subject of another pending proceeding."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.952,289.292,Suppose that respondent who started his own show in the... in the CIT... when the defendant in that case turns up as plaintiff in Kansas District Court... was it?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,291.271,303.038,"At the time that the present action was commenced, the plaintiff in this action was one of three named people whom the respondent was trying to get an investigation started against."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.038,303.781,No.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,308.239,309.187,Correct.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.187,309.93,And it's in Kansas.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,309.93,310.551,That's correct.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.551,311.044,Okay.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,335.21,335.936,Yes.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.936,340.19,"Then, I take it, the judgment is rendered."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,348.279,352.943,"That is a hypothetical situation, different from this case."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.477,364.172,"I'm asking you a question that puts together two claims, not counterclaims, two claims."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,383.014,394.076,"I... I would say in practice that would depend in large measure on the sequence in which the matters are tried, whether they are tried at the same time, whether they are tried separately."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.076,394.553,"Yes, they are tried at the same time."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,394.553,395.379,Tried at the same time?
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.008,413.955,They're both plaintiffs.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,413.955,415.237,I understand.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,427.968,440.416,Are you suggesting in... in response to my question that they would... these two cases that have been consolidated would then be split apart for purposes of appeal and one claim would go to a regional circuit and the other to the Federal Circuit?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,440.416,456.391,"--It would be open to the parties to that litigation in... where they're both plaintiffs and they both have filed claims, to request the entry of judgments if they felt it was in their interest to do so, based on the outcome of the trial."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,456.391,459.197,"Well, you're assuming they could have separate judgments under 54(b)."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,460.312,461.305,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.305,461.798,Yes.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,468.857,470.138,Not... not necessarily.
2001.01-408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.138,470.965,Come on.
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.21,474.308,"Well, why not?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,476.453,492.363,"I think it's important to understand that when a... when a person comes to court and asked for a court to vary the rights and obligations of parties, seeks judicial relief, what that person comes to court with is a bundle of rights."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.943,517.898,May I... may I interrupt and ask a kind of a basic question here?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,517.898,518.519,--Certainly.
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.519,540.355,"It seems to me that you could prevail on either of two theories, that... that the counterclaim should be ignored for purposes of selecting the appellate court to go to, or you could say that in this particular case, you got a 54(b) judgment that had... was totally unrelated to patent claims and therefore, in this case, regardless of whether we agree with Aerojet or the rest, you should prevail."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,549.205,550.674,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.674,560.517,"You're not relying on the fact that... that there was a severance of the non-patent claims under... with a 54(b) finding, that it was a separate claim."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,560.517,562.746,That would provide a narrower basis for reversal.
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.746,564.792,But you're not asking us to rule on that basis.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,564.792,569.25,"Well, we did in the petition, but the Court declined to accept question 2 in the petition."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.132,574.906,I see.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,574.906,578.91,And the Court did not accept that question before the Court.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.013,652.47,"In the... in the context where there's a great concern about Federal-State relations, cases lodged in the State court being lifted out of that State court and put into a Federal court, this context is totally different."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,681.511,683.656,"Your Honor, I would say two things in response to that."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,743.924,750.529,"Christianson was the first time the Court encountered this issue, and Christianson affirmed the Federal Circuit."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,797.506,812.944,"Justice Ginsburg, in Aerojet, the Federal Circuit stated, among other things, that the traditional prerogative of the plaintiff to choose his law and to choose his court applies only to the trial court level."
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.752,851.21,"When you say choice of law, you're not talking strictly about patent law, I take it."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,851.21,851.832,Absolutely not.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.926,858.891,You're talking about Federal law interpreted differently by different circuits.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,858.891,860.21,--Precisely.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.21,864.835,It's not like am I going to choose the law of France or the law of Oklahoma versus the law of New York.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,864.835,866.071,That's absolutely the case.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.131,938.312,"That's a little odd, don't you think?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,957.548,964.235,"Well, early in its history the Federal Circuit seemed to be more mindful of that type of conflict than it is today."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.218,1005.474,"Well, you... you don't mean that the Federal Circuit has asserted that where you have a State claim, that it's going to apply Federal law to that State claim."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1005.474,1007.703,That is exactly what it did in the Midwest case.
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.446,1010.554,"Mr. Dabney, we're all quite close to you."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.64,1026.195,"You... you are saying that the Federal Circuit said we have the right not only to determine what is an answer to a Federal issue, but we have a right to tell Iowa what the law of the State of Iowa is?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1027.021,1049.43,"--I invite Your Honor to look at pages 1564 and 65 of volume 175 of Federal 3rd, and Your Honor will read there that the Federal Circuit reversed a summary judgment under Iowa State law on the ground that in its view the Federal patent law doesn't limit any claim that can be asserted under Iowa State law."
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.115,1059.716,"Mr. Dabney, would you heed my admonition?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1061.59,1062.688,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1067.435,1074.494,"On... on one point that you made about the Federal Circuit saying, well, if it's a Federal question, what is the Federal law?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1085.434,1096.02,"--I am not questioning that that is what the Federal Circuit is currently doing, and that it... it... I'm not questioning it has the power to do that."
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.02,1098.725,May I ask this... just a question about the history of what we've got before us?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1123.989,1128.714,I cannot say that that is a fair characterization of what the bar generally holds.
2001.01-408,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1134.474,1136.249,Is it--
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.249,1144.134,"--So, it is true that this... this has become a much more important problem since they changed the... their rule on what they do with the ancillary claims."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1144.134,1145.908,It has much greater practical significance now.
2001.01-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.921,1152.513,The jurisdiction rule is the same in either event.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1152.513,1153.506,--Is... is the same.
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.192,1170.596,"Well, may I ask a question?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1170.596,1171.172,Certainly.
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.172,1191.234,"Not... not your case certainly, but we had a case called Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton International in 1993, which seemed to say that a patent law counterclaim could serve as an independent basis for a district court's original jurisdiction."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1191.234,1194.866,"That's not how I read Cardinal Chemical, Justice O'Connor."
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.866,1195.42,Okay.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1195.42,1197.345,Cardinal Chemical was a straight-up patent infringement case.
2001.01-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.639,1243.163,Not 1338?
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1243.163,1244.172,--Not... absolutely not.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.218,1271.399,"What is... what is... taking a case, Mr. Dabney... and this has come up I think again and again... where you have a counterclaim that would qualify for Federal jurisdiction whether under 1331, 1338, whatever, that for whatever reason, the main claim drops out, maybe because it failed... fails to state a claim."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1296.912,1301.203,--I don't believe that's a correct statement of 1367.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1303.328,1312.266,"Are there not many, many cases in the district court, blessed by the courts of appeals, where exactly what I've described happens?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1333.404,1335.3,--That is what happens--
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.3,1336.869,Because... because the only Federal peg is gone.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1347.272,1347.893,--Yes.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.9,1385.25,"The question I asked you is you said that what had been going on for years before there was 1367 codified, all of a sudden that independent Federal claim, be it an antitrust claim, a patent claim, suddenly becomes shrunken to a supplemental jurisdiction rather than having its own jurisdictional peg."
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1385.25,1404.403,--I don't know that the legal significance of the source of a district court's power to act in that situation has ever been a subject on which any legal consequences followed so that the body of law that developed on that would have any precedential significance in this situation.
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.591,1509.974,"And what about a defendant who would just love to have... not particularly litigious, has a claim, a good claim, asserts it as a counterclaim, goes into the district court because that's where it belongs?"
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1525.684,1543.683,"This Court has held and the... the congressional choice of the arising under referent for Federal Circuit jurisdiction clearly recognized that there will be many, many times when patent law questions and patent law issues, including the issue of validity, will be decided not just in the regional circuits, but in the State courts."
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.238,1573.86,This defendant did.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1573.86,1574.686,--I'm sorry?
2001.01-408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1574.686,1575.633,Didn't... this defendant did.
2001.01-408,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1577.408,1586.491,The respondent... and... and it was free at all times to pursue all available remedies in that forum and that's not... that's not even in question at this point.
2001.01-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.133,1612.331,"--Very well, Mr. Dabney."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1614.931,1631.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In light of the colloquy that we've had, I want to make a preliminary point and then a couple other starting points."
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.399,1666.572,"Mr. Gowdey, do you think the court of... the Federal Circuit's opinion here is entirely consistent with footnote 2 in our Colt opinion?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1666.572,1669.256,"In the which opinion, Your Honor?"
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.256,1672.228,In... in our Christianson v. Colt Industries?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1672.228,1679.593,I think... I think that the position that the Federal Circuit has taken this Court is completely consistent with Christian v. Colt.
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.593,1681.888,And... and with footnote 2 therein?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1681.888,1682.548,Yes.
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1712.269,1715.037,"Mr. Gowdey, may I suggest that you raise that a little higher?"
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1716.645,1718.874,We had the opposite problem.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1725.644,1727.669,--I... I do have a soft voice and I apologize.
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.56,1768.657,"--Well, that's... that's this CAFC's ruling on its own jurisdiction."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1768.657,1769.279,--That's correct.
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.279,1769.855,In the Aerojet case.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1769.855,1770.681,Yes.
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.136,1775.716,"So, in effect, we're trying to decide whether that's right in this circumstance."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1775.716,1777.452,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.969,1803.003,"But it does seem to be unlikely, does it not, that where the counterclaim raising the patent issue hasn't been dealt with and what we're dealing with is an appeal from this injunction which was rendered in the plaintiff's suit below... why should the CAFC get into it at all?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1803.003,1809.486,"--Because we should look at jurisdiction for an appellate court at the time of the pleading stage of the case, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1813.877,1819.184,I would think it would have to be considered also in light of what's happened in this case.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1828.722,1832.066,"--I... I don't think it's odd, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.443,1867.481,"Well, what case of ours do you think most strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional question?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1867.481,1876.026,"I... I think you have to look at Christian v. Colt and the fact that in that case, the decision said it should be adapted to 1338."
2001.01-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.939,1901.373,"Mr. Gowdey, I... I think Aerojet makes a whole lot of sense if... if the issue before the... the court there and the issue before us here were what makes sense."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1977.451,1979.103,--Well--
2001.01-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.103,1981.145,And that's what I think we said in Christianson.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,1981.145,1985.253,"--Well, in Christian v.... in Christianson, however, there was no counterclaim."
2001.01-408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.478,2007.916,"Not just Aerojet, but I would like you to pursue that because my understanding is the same as Justice Scalia's."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2043.293,2044.286,--Yes--
2001.01-408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.286,2044.641,I agree.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2065.295,2069.094,"--Well, for the reasons set forth in Aerojet."
2001.01-408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.174,2075.797,"Aerojet, to my way of thinking, just said it's a counterclaim."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2084.077,2090.103,--And... and I think most of the cases that I'm aware of that talk about counterclaims are removal cases.
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.621,2093.465,Are what... what kind of cases?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2093.465,2097.702,"Removal cases, Your Honor, where... where you... and there is no issue of federalism here."
2001.01-408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.819,2119.826,"Then you're... you're now defeating your first concession which was with footnote 2 in Aerojet, that we are to deal with this case exactly as if it were a removal case because it's a question of all Federal jurisdiction, not just patent."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2131.526,2132.458,Well-- [Laughter]
2001.01-408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.458,2139.599,"But once you tell me that this involves all cases of removal, I suddenly get quite nervous about departing from well-settled law."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2139.599,2140.92,Then... then I must retract it.
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2152.603,2162.634,"Well, then that means we interpret, under your view, arising under in different ways in the... in the patent statute and in... in the Federal jurisdiction statute."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2162.634,2174.151,"I... I think that arising under is not to be interpreted in a different way, but I think as this Court said in Christianson, that it should be adapted to 1338."
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.984,2195.161,"But certainly Christianson gave no intimation that the phrase, arising under, should be interpreted differently in the statute conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit as it has traditionally been in 1331."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2195.161,2196.442,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.442,2199.991,Is there a difference in interpreting a different way and adapting?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2199.991,2205.358,I... I think it's a question of... of looking at claims that are pled in a case.
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.921,2273.347,"But that's... you can say that by analogy to 1331 too, that although you can have a... a compulsory counterclaim will not change the result there."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2286.35,2288.413,It does not change the rule.
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.666,2297.041,But why does it make a difference if we're talking about removal cases?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2299.437,2307.361,"--Because I think in a Federal/Federal situation where there is no federalism, there is no issue with respect to States' rights and States' claims."
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.063,2416.77,"But you... you can say, I think, that when Congress used the term, well-pleaded complaint, its intent was to have the same sort of analysis as there is in 1331."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2416.77,2420.924,--I... I think the language is the same.
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2422.903,2427.073,Congress didn't use it... Congress didn't say well-pleaded complaint.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2431.076,2434.382,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.107,2456.218,But you are giving arising under a different meaning for appellate purposes.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2471.655,2472.937,--I... I think--
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2472.937,2475.249,You're suggesting they do count for appellate jurisdiction.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2475.249,2492.46,"--I'm suggesting that they do, and I'm suggesting that Congress recognized that in 1295 where... where, unlike petitioner, I... I think when... when a plaintiff comes into court, clearly he has his choice of... of what Federal court to go to, what State, and so on."
2001.01-408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2503.977,2513.72,"Suppose you did do that, which... I mean, suppose you took Justice Stevens' concurring view in Christianson, which was a view that would come closer to doing what you want."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2525.404,2529.324,"Well, I think Justice Stevens actually goes farther than we need to go because--"
2001.01-408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2529.324,2530.622,"Well, why farther?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2536.671,2537.785,--Well--
2001.01-408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2537.785,2539.355,"Now, how could you go further than that?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2539.355,2542.161,"--Well, I'm saying he... he went further."
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2568.333,2571.611,Was there patents issue adjudicated at all here?
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2577.167,2580.76,"There has not been a patent ruling yet, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.163,2585.878,"So, there's not only the no judgment, but no adjudication?"
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2585.878,2588.972,"--No adjudication, not even any discovery, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2602.513,2610.232,I think it would be consistent with Justice Stevens' opinion to say you look to see what was adjudicated.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2627.117,2635.8,"1338, however, talks about civil actions, and civil actions goes... goes back to a description of being all claims for relief."
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2675.786,2691.761,"If the district court has to decide which of two different circuits' laws you're going to follow, I guess he knows what the case is going to look like at the end... or she."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2700.285,2702.786,"Well, but if... Your Honor, if... if--"
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2702.786,2705.219,It's a circular analysis.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2705.219,2728.996,"--If... if you're looking at the claims that are pled at the pleading stage, the district court judge will know what appellate court will... will apply certainly under the Aerojet rule, which... which again would... would place appellate jurisdiction at the Federal Circuit if you have a well-pled patent counterclaim coming in at the pleading stage as part of the defendant's answer."
2001.01-408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2728.996,2744.972,But you will... you will have the situation then in which the district judge is... is going to have to defy the law of his circuit on a... on the non-patent issue.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2744.972,2749.901,Perhaps that's a more difficult question.
2001.01-408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2762.972,2775.353,"Well, the claim is... and I... I will be candid to say I'm not in a position to... to evaluate this claim because I haven't gone back and looked at... at many of the cases on it to find out what's really going on."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2778.491,2792.898,"Well, I think the Federal Circuit is making an attempt to look at its... its historical base for decisions with respect to those issues that relate to, in effect, patent law issues."
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.105,2826.213,That's what it used to do.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2831.247,2838.966,"I think they are, and I think as the... the court was started in 1982, and by... by that measure, it's a relatively young court."
2001.01-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.31,2844.706,"Well, I understand at the time Aerojet was decided, they did that."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2854.57,2864.396,"Certainly in Midwest, they... they were... they were taking a look at trade dress law because of the interrelationship trade dress has on the Lanham Act with patent issues."
2001.01-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.4,2888.75,"But that seems somewhat inconsistent with the last part of 1295(a), which in effect says that when it's a non-patent law issue, they... the 1291 and the 1292 and 1294 shall apply."
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2888.75,2892.919,"Are you talking about the exception of 1295, Your Honor?"
2001.01-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.919,2893.475,Yes.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2893.475,2902.784,"Certainly that's a two-part exception, and where you have other claims pending, you can still have jurisdiction under 1338."
2001.01-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.784,2904.065,Okay.
2001.01-408,1,37912,peter_w_gowdey,,2928.231,2930.814,"It keeps all well employed, Your Honor."
2001.01-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.853,3032.544,"Thank you, Mr. Gowdey."
2001.01-408,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3035.211,3046.069,"In response to your question, Mr. Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different interpretation and adaptation."
2001.01-408,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.215,3188.898,You're... you're telling us that this is unqualified.
2001.01-408,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3202.002,3205.534,That... it is the issue that was before this Court in the TrafFix case.
2001.01-408,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.589,3224.277,And I don't see what the Federal Circuit meant when it said the relationship between patent law and other Federal rights.
2001.01-408,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3224.277,3225.529,--The Federal--
2001.01-408,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3225.529,3227.925,Questions involving the relationship between those two.
2001.01-408,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3231.995,3236.741,--The Federal Circuit has taken the position that... I'm sorry.
2001.01-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.227,3239.154,"Yes, briefly."
2001.01-408,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3239.154,3250.116,"The Federal Circuit has taken the position that Federal patent law does not create any right to copy or use anything, and therefore, it was wrong for the Court in Midwest to say that Iowa State law could not protect that."
2001.01-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.116,3251.231,"Thank you, Mr. Dabney."
