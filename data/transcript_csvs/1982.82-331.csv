1982.82-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.995,"We will hear arguments first this morning in New Mexico, et al against the Mescalero Apache Tribe."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,15.337,21.926,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,213.61,230.059,"Well, would it make any difference, Mr. Dunnigan, how much of the activity the Mescaleros were engaged in, whether it was one resort or a great many, a small amount or a great deal of this hunting?"
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,230.059,240.116,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that the amount or the size of the commercial enterprise of the tribe has any jurisdictional significance."
1982.82-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.116,244.835,"How do you distinguish it from the logging operations, for example?"
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,244.835,259.485,"Well, Your Honor, the logging operations were conducted by non-Indian companies together with Indian enterprises."
1982.82-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.485,265.654,"The Indians could have done it all on their own if they wanted, had they had the equipment and the personnel."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,265.654,267.479,"Yes, Your Honor, I presume that is true."
1982.82-331,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.045,303.514,Mr. Dunnigan.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,303.514,304.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-331,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.668,324.63,"The Court in Montana v. United States, of course, recognized that an Indian tribe can prohibit non-members from hunting and fishing on the reservation or can allow them and condition that permit as the tribe determines."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,349.056,372.048,"Your Honor, I recognize that the Montana case articulates the principles you have described, and we do not argue that the Mescalero Apache Tribe does not have the right to admit hunters or fisherman if it desires or preclude hunting and fishing if it desires."
1982.82-331,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.084,400.803,But they could be totally inconsistent.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,419.762,439.833,"Your Honor, you suggest an extreme case, which is not a part of the factual situation here, but I acknowledge that, built in to a system of concurrent jurisdiction is the possibility of conflicts arising between the two sets of laws."
1982.82-331,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.945,570.077,"Mr. Dunnigan, perhaps I am mistaken, but I thought the record does disclose conflicts between the state system and the tribal system particularly as to the taking of deer, that does may not be taken under the state regulations, but under the tribal ones a buck and a doe could be taken."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,571.45,572.733,"--Your Honor, no, you are quite correct."
1982.82-331,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,572.733,577.619,So we do have some very definite conflicts as Justice O'Connor indicated?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,577.619,578.979,"Your Honor, we do have conflicts."
1982.82-331,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,641.064,651.749,"Well, as I understand your position, you want the state regulation uniformly applied to non-Indians all across the state."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,651.749,653.075,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-331,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,654.778,664.289,And that there should not be an exception of a cuna so to speak for the Mescalero reservation?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,664.289,687.811,"That is correct, Your Honor, or for any one of the other 26 Indian reservations or enclaves located in New Mexico which together comprise over 7 million acres of land and 11,000 square miles, approximately 10 percent of the land area of the State of New Mexico and located in virtually every region or part of the state."
1982.82-331,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.811,693.041,"Mr. Dunnigan, it seems to me there might be two different types of problems."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,707.488,711.02,"Your Honor, that is in our statement--"
1982.82-331,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.02,713.064,"If they had their own licensing system, which I guess they do."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,713.064,713.786,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.82-331,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.786,716.628,Assuming the Indians have their own licensing system which I guess they do.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,716.628,718.235,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.181,779.072,Am I in error that it is agreed that the Indian licensing procedure is a good one?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,783.13,796.311,"Your Honor, we recognize that the tribe has a licensing permit system and have no quarrel with their right to impose one."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.412,823.066,"So, where does the state get this additional interest?"
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,823.066,826.956,"Well, the state's interest, Your Honor, is--"
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.956,834.28,Its interest is that they do it... Their signatures on there are better than the Indian's signature on the license?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,834.28,843.448,"--No, Your Honor, it has nothing to do with whether one licensing system is better than another."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.915,858.036,"You never applied for that under the federal law, did you, the right to jurisdiction over the Indian reservation, did you?"
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,858.036,858.929,--The--
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.929,860.24,New Mexico did not.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,861.004,863.052,"--New Mexico is not a Public Law 280 state, no, Your Honor."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,863.052,863.8,That is what I mean.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,863.8,864.926,But in our view--
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.926,866.314,Where did they get it from?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,866.314,867.425,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.425,869.204,Where does New Mexico get it from?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,869.204,878.434,"Well, Your Honor, in our view the Public Law 280 is not the only source of authority for a state to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians within its borders."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,878.434,880.684,My question was where did you get it?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,880.684,923.45,"Our authority over non-Indians, Your Honor, stems from the fact that New Mexico is one of the 50 sovereign states of the union and was admitted to the union on equal protection with other states who have the authority within their borders even on Indian land to apply their laws to non-Indians unless, again, those laws have been preempted by a superior congressional enactment and scheme of regulation or unless in a particular situation the non-Indian is acting in relationship to the tribe so that the internal governmental affairs and social relations of the tribe are intimately involved in that situation."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,923.45,925.962,Like in Montana v. United States?
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,925.962,936.865,"Yes, Your Honor, and Confederated Tribes of the Coville Indian Reservation v. Washington, and Thomas v. Gay, and Mescalero v. Jones."
1982.82-331,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,936.865,940.629,This case was sent back on Montana and not on any other case.
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,940.629,941.989,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-331,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1074.404,1089.944,"But you have a statute here, 18 U.S.C. 1165 in which Congress has indicated that there is a right of the tribe to regulate the hunting and fishing on the reservation as to non-members."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,1089.944,1109.343,"--Your Honor, we recognize that 1165 provides a criminal trespass penalty, a federal criminal trespass penalty to be imposed upon a person who enters a reservation without the permission of the tribe for purposes of hunting or fishing."
1982.82-331,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.472,1152.73,"Well, certainly the statute unlike, for example, the liquor statute, it does not indicate that the hunting and fishing has to be done in conformity with the laws of the state."
1982.82-331,0,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,1157.573,1158.977,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.435,1693.307,Very well.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1699.726,1703.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.766,1802.653,Would it make any difference if it were not?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1802.653,1812.932,"--No, sir, but the reason people will pay substantial money for a package hunt on the Mescalero Indian Reservation is because it all fits together."
1982.82-331,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.911,1984.846,"Mr. Fettinger, is the hunter going to run into any problems knowing when he leaves the land that is governed by state licensing and going onto the Indian reservation?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1984.846,1990.343,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the reservation is one, mountainous terrain to begin with."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.767,2026.234,Aren't the elk free to leave the reservation?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2026.234,2033.699,"--Unfortuntely, we would have to concede that our elk are perfectly healthy and well able to go over a four strand barbed wire fence in one bound."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.699,2034.622,Or through it?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2034.622,2035.87,Hopefully not through it.
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.29,2040.414,"Well, they do nevertheless."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2040.414,2041.073,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.696,2049.741,Do they roam mostly for food?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2049.741,2050.506,"--No, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.696,2092.285,What damage to the tribal interests would occur if the state regulation were able to be enforced against non-Indians?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2092.285,2093.455,--Several--
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.455,2098.112,"That would add another expense, I suppose, to the hunter."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2103.516,2104.124,"--No, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.545,2112.745,Are a lot of your people from out of state?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2112.745,2113.603,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.292,2121.602,What is the out of state game license in New Mexico for an elk?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2121.602,2132.454,"--It runs about $200 plus... no, it went from $300 to $500 with the last session of the legislature, I believe, on some of the exotic animals."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.047,2134.346,What about elk?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2134.346,2138.763,"--Elk, I believe, is in the $250 range."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.763,2144.246,What other damage... I suppose that would be a deterrent.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2150.321,2154.213,"Mr. Justice White, it is not just a matter of the economics."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.142,2174.218,I suppose you would want to control the number of elk?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2174.218,2175.22,--Sir?
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.22,2178.124,I suppose you also want to control the number of elk.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2178.124,2180.027,We are doing very well at controlling the number of elk.
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.029,2186.777,If you had only one season a year it might be a little problem.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2186.777,2195.525,"--We could have too many elk, I presume, but they conceive that our game management is workmanlike at worst case, so that we do not have that problem."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.584,2210.675,What would the state do... how would application of the state law to any individual white hunter interfere with your having more than one season?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2210.675,2216.328,--They have a season that they suggest to us by their lawsuit that we must--
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.328,2224.793,"Any white hunter that wanted to hunt in one of your seasons that did not fall within the state season would be subject to arrest, I guess?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2224.793,2225.573,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.382,2248.394,"They would arrest people with... who had elk in excess of the bag limits, I suppose."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2248.394,2248.862,"--No, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.134,2273.553,How large is the reservation?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2273.553,2275.913,"Four hundred sixty thousand acres, which is--"
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.913,2276.396,How many?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2276.396,2278.974,--Four hundred sixty thousand acres.
1982.82-331,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.819,2281.474,What is that?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2285.221,2289.456,"--I have never worked it out in terms of square miles, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but--"
1982.82-331,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.456,2291.937,"Six forty into 460, yes."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2291.937,2295.559,--Can we do our arithmetic later?
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.385,2309.319,How many non-Indians live on the reservation?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2309.319,2310.209,Not very many.
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.951,2337.201,"Mr. Fettinger, I am interested in the legal theory that supports your position."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2345.948,2346.462,"No, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.454,2375.327,"What if we had a case in which they agreed you handled the elk well, but you did not handle the antelope very well, say, or something like that, that there were some areas where you were superb and some areas in which they regarded you as deficient."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2381.48,2395.772,"--I might suggest to the Court that the Court has already said that the species, perhaps, is pertinent, and you cannot chase the last steel head into the net theory might be applicable to this sort of a case dealing with an Indian reservation."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.344,2412.155,"But lots of times lawsuits are not that easy, you know, the facts are in dispute."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2419.088,2420.105,"No, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.126,2446.002,--Your theory is not limited to a well managed tribe.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2465.335,2469.523,We do not equate this case to the gambling situation for a couple of reasons.
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.252,2492.09,"Maybe I cannot think of one right away, but some activity that is prohibited by state law, maybe selling liquor on Sunday or after 12 o'clock at night or something like that and the tribe thought, well, they would rather do it differently."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2496.497,2503.507,"--Unfortunately, I think this Court has generally said that those items are treated independently."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.6,2555.129,I am trying to find out really are you relying primarily on a federal preemption theory or an Indian tribal sovereignty theory?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2555.129,2560.702,--It is difficult to separate them because the language even of this Court is that you--
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.702,2562.172,But analytically they are quite different--
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2562.172,2563.763,--will lose against the backdrop of tribal sovereignty.
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.622,2570.232,"--Obviously that is true, but I am still not clear on what you legal theory is."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2570.232,2575.618,"In answer to your question, we would tend to say we agree with the Tenth Circuit opinion and that is a simple answer to your question."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.618,2577.322,That is all you have to help me with?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2577.322,2579.151,That is not all we have to help you with.
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.367,2630.658,"But one of the questions in a case like this is to what extent can an Indian tribe running a commercial organization like this, attracting business from non-Indians, use its ability to grant exemptions from state laws, for example, sell hunting licenses at cut rate prices."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2635.939,2640.934,"Well, one, I would suggest, please, we are not selling hunting licenses at cut rate prices--"
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.934,2642.201,"Well, what do you licenses cost?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2643.668,2654.165,"--Our license packages run as high today... on the record in 1967 were under $2,000 per elk with a package hunt, $800 plus without the package."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.805,2659.695,"When you talk about package, do you sell the licenses separately?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2659.695,2662.148,"Well, we have a package hunt that includes the room, the meals--"
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.148,2662.741,Do you sell the licenses separately?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2662.741,2663.131,--Yes.
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.63,2665.224,What is the cost of a separate license?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2665.224,2667.629,"Roughly, on the record, it is approximately $800."
1982.82-331,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.629,2668.441,Eight hundred dollars?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2668.441,2669.158,That is in 1967.
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.379,2676.358,That is to hunt anything on the reservation?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2676.358,2676.798,That is the prime.
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.42,2681.107,"But you can hunt anything else, too?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2681.107,2681.606,No.
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.152,2695.274,"If you want to come on the reservation, and get one elk, it will cost you $800?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2695.274,2695.882,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.758,2699.038,Just for one day?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2699.038,2703.304,"Well, the period of time during which you can hunt is not limited to one day."
1982.82-331,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.304,2708.766,"I know, but if I want to come on even for one day and get one elk, it is $800?"
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2708.766,2712.283,"Yes, sir, and we do not have too much difficulty selling those permits."
1982.82-331,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2770.632,2779.613,"Mr. Fettinger, your time is running out, and like Justice Stevens, I am a little concerned about your legal theory more than I am about the facts."
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2800.888,2818.881,"Well, in this particular case, our treaty does contain, and this is all covered in our brief beginning at about page roughly 20 or 22, the treaty that the Mescalero Apaches have provides the wording that we are under the exclusive control of the United States government."
1982.82-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.372,2878.012,Was this reservation created before New Mexico was a state?
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2878.012,2881.12,We have a treaty of 1851.
1982.82-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.71,2900.833,I have the same difficulty that others on the bench have had in discerning your theory.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2921.324,2926.179,"We would love to have that be the ruling of this Court, of course, sir--"
1982.82-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2926.179,2928.07,Subject to the Interior Department control.
1982.82-331,1,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2928.07,2928.959,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.594,2962.604,"Mr. Claiborne, would you mind addressing my last question and those of the others on the theory?"
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2962.604,2965.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, certainly."
1982.82-331,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3243.907,3256.432,"If it were being mismanaged badly for any reason, lack of direction at the top, what would be the control of the Department of Interior?"
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3256.432,3276.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is important that the Department of Interior yearly, annually, approves each of the ordinances enacted by the tribe and in that way assures itself that the management scheme of the tribe is indeed a sound one."
1982.82-331,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3321.203,3333.041,"Mr. Claiborne, are there any other Indian tribes in New Mexico that are regulated in a comparable way to this particular tribe?"
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3333.041,3336.976,"Justice Powell, I should know the answer, but I don't."
1982.82-331,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3338.556,3351.881,What I am leading up to inquire is whether or not the federal government customarily approves the ordinances of tribes around the United States with respect to the taking of game and fish?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3351.881,3369.105,"--Justice Powell, I think it is right to say that the United States or the Department of Interior customarily approves any tribal ordinance which has an effect on non-Indians within that reservation, whether it is hunting or fishing or any other activity."
1982.82-331,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3394.346,3406.278,Does the supervision of the federal government go to the extent of ascertaining whether or not their game and fish laws are enforced by the tribe?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3406.278,3416.398,"--I don't know that that is so, Justice Powell, but I must say that here there is no suggestion--"
1982.82-331,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3416.398,3421.241,"I understand the facts of this case, but I have the same interest that other Justices have expressed."
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3439.389,3458.384,"--Well, and that is the aspect in which this case, though different from White Mountain Apache, involves an equally pervasive if not more pervasive scheme of regulation which has the imprimatur of federal approval and continuing federal monitoring."
1982.82-331,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.384,3476.642,"Well, in that case, Mr. Claiborne, it would have been unnecessary for the Court to refer at all in White Mountain Apache to the federal statutory structure if a tribal ordinance which is approved by the Department of the Interior has the force of federal preemptive law."
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3480.825,3488.635,"Justice Rehnquist, in White Mountain Apache so far as I am aware there was no tribal comprehensive scheme."
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.234,3539.131,"That may be so, but you would still have to reach the conclusion that state law was entirely preempted, either that the tribe has occupied the field, so to speak... just preemption would not mean anything more than that the state law is preempted to the extent that it is inconsistent with the tribal ordinance."
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3543.725,3560.263,I invoke the Court's holdings in White Mountain Apache and in Ramah Navajo to the effect that the preemption test with respect to preemption of state law on Indian reservations is a very different one.
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.162,3589.048,You still have to reach the conclusion that the field has been sufficiently occupied to exclude the state entirely?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3589.048,3589.859,--Indeed.
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.971,3595.81,Even to the extent of not being able to control non-Indians?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3595.81,3604.369,--I would submit that there is here plainly no room left for duplicative and conflicting regulation by the State of New Mexico.
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.369,3607.773,How about non-conflicting regulations?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3607.773,3614.114,"Well, to the extent that it is wholly consistent, it may be--"
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.114,3615.21,How about just a license?
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3615.21,3616.224,"--Well, the licences--"
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3616.224,3620.896,And then with the state license they can go on the reservation any time the Indians want--
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3620.896,3627.876,"--The state license is imposing an additional, an important burden in the same way that the tax in White Mountain Apache--"
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3627.876,3634.638,--It isn't inconsistent with any federal statute or any Indian regulation.
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3634.638,3639.372,"--Nor is any tax, as the tax in White Mountain, ever inconsistent."
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.119,3647.011,They are not taxing the tribe.
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3647.011,3647.947,"--I am sorry, sir?"
1982.82-331,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.947,3649.943,They are not taxing the tribe or Indians.
1982.82-331,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3654.178,3666.765,Nor was the tax in White Mountain imposed on Indians but on the non-Indian corporation and so in Ramah it was imposed on the construction company and nevertheless was held to be preempted by federal regulation.
1982.82-331,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3666.765,3670.077,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Dunigan?"
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3672.545,3675.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-331,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3795.087,3798.803,"That isn't consistent with some of our cases, is it?"
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3798.803,3804.223,"--No, the cases of this Court would not permit that at all."
1982.82-331,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3824.637,3825.479,May I ask you a question--
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3846.58,3855.249,"--Well, Your Honor, in terms of the question of whether or not a tribe by its actions can preempt state law, there wouldn't be any difference at all because--"
1982.82-331,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3855.249,3856.812,You are selling hunting packages--
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3856.812,3857.358,--We are selling--
1982.82-331,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3857.358,3859.654,--instead of packages of cigarettes?
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3859.654,3860.497,--That is correct.
1982.82-331,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3862.512,3866.151,In competition with other people who want to sell hunting packages?
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3894.656,3900.341,--There is absolutely no state restriction applicable to that situation at all.
1982.82-331,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3914.837,3917.27,Did you say wouldn't or couldn't?
1982.82-331,3,42631,thomas_l_dunigan,,3921.66,3924.519,"No, Your Honor, I do not think the state could do that."
1982.82-331,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3936.405,3937.419,"Thank you, gentlemen."
