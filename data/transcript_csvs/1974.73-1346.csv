1974.73-1346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.34,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-1346, McLucas against DeChamplain."
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,55.252,57.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.433,167.52,"Well, the appealability to District Court’s orders to this Court is still on that case?"
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,167.52,169.705,That is in the case and I intend to address it.
1974.73-1346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,231.501,234.873,And the disclosure is to whom?
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,242.842,247.624,The District Court orders they may be made available in the court-martial proceeding on these terms.
1974.73-1346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,247.624,249.377,Not in the District Court?
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,249.377,250.858,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.696,408.526,"Well, Mr. Bork, where you're appealing from a judgment holding a federal statute unconstitutional under 1252 you don’t find the counter part of 1253’s language where the right to appeal turns on whether or not three-judge District Court was required, do you?"
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,408.526,419.725,"Well, no I hope you find the counterpart in the language but I would assume that if there was no jurisdiction in the District Court there might well be a question about the jurisdiction here, perhaps not."
1974.73-1346,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.834,442.0,But therefore the District Court clearly had jurisdiction and that the plain language of 1252 allows an appeal here?
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,442.0,443.371,That’s quite correct.
1974.73-1346,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.874,1093.815,With Younger against Harris as we both know was a premise to great deal upon what the court opinion called in capital letters -- our federalism and that (Voice Overlap) that is not an ingredient here.
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1093.815,1125.046,"No, I think there is a comparable not a strong but there is a constitutional value which parallels that in Congress as constitutional power provide special rules and hence special courts for the military and I think all of the policy reasons that are mentioned in Younger against Harris as equally applicable here and I think Gusik against Schilder tends to equate the two systems: state system and the military system in terms of nonintervention -- premature intervention by federal courts by Article III courts."
1974.73-1346,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1228.211,1238.691,"General Bork, if this case were not pursued in the military system, where would it be venued if it were in the civilian side?"
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1238.691,1244.356,"Well, I'm not quite clear where it would be Mr. Justice Blackmun because the offense took place overseas."
1974.73-1346,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1269.289,1272.373,May I ask you one more question before you sit down.
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1281.009,1290.005,"No, as I understand that appellee says that they thought it was not necessary because the three-judge court would be bound by the Court of Appeals decision in Avrech."
1974.73-1346,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1290.005,1290.476,Yes.
1974.73-1346,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1290.476,1296.922,So that it will have no substantial question to decide in any event.
1974.73-1346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.922,1299.852,Mr. Boudin
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1299.852,1304.256,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.143,2049.297,Do I miss -- if I misrecollected Mr. Boudin and maybe you’ve mentioned this that in this second proposed trial the Government is not going to use that.
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2049.297,2060.764,"The Government is not going to use them they can look at them, they may very well rely upon what was in the prior trial record Your Honor is quite right to determine how to cross-examine DeChamplain."
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.389,2078.27,"Well, you do know that though they are not making the same charges."
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2079.629,2084.893,They have eliminated some of the documents and they say that no longer charging with respect to those 15.
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.893,2085.554,Right.
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2085.554,2098.097,But the 15 were part of the original conspiracy and I have a right to direct myself to that original conspiracy which was the basis of the charges and to see what there is in the record that they taken away.
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.444,2123.892,"Now, that it is the entire, is the entire record of the first trial sealed?"
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2123.892,2128.662,"Sealed for the Government, my military counsel may look at it but they can’t tell me about it."
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.662,2129.522,The entire record?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2129.522,2130.575,Yes.
1974.73-1346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.721,2265.183,Johnson against Zerbst was federal review of federal court?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2265.183,2267.658,Precisely Your Honor and it is quite true.
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.178,2355.681,"Yes, but Younger wasn’t based on that statute at all?"
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2355.681,2356.148,"No, it was not."
1974.73-1346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.148,2356.664,It could have been?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2356.664,2361.78,The court pointed out but it did not mention the statute at the beginning as an indication of federal policy.
1974.73-1346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.78,2373.576,"Well, Mitchum against Foster though held that the Civil Rights Act was an exemption to that statute and so it said nonetheless Younger applied independently of the statute and only Younger applied in that kind of a situation?"
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2373.576,2374.475,Right.
1974.73-1346,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2415.485,2417.502,"Well, that was Boyle against Landry in which it was attacked in the United States."
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2417.502,2419.579,But and the Younger was likewise.
1974.73-1346,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.579,2422.338,Younger was trying to enjoin a trial?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2422.338,2422.758,Yes.
1974.73-1346,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.484,2539.595,"Of course, if they’re irreparable injury is enough then Younger is meaningless because you have to show irreparable injury to get ever get any injunction from any court of equity under any circumstances --"
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2539.595,2541.425,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1974.73-1346,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.566,2548.462,That’s just a foundation for ever getting an injunction you have to show irreparable injury and a lack of an adequate remedy at law.
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2548.462,2556.889,But we also have here the problem of the constitutional right of the defendant and whether or not he is to be tried before a tribunal.
1974.73-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.993,2685.932,"Well, as a matter of fact the court said no jurisdiction before Burns, did they?"
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2685.932,2686.681,Exactly.
1974.73-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.681,2691.809,Absolutely none in Burns as a recent case?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2691.809,2696.073,Burns was a recent case in which the Court examined the record and --
1974.73-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.073,2697.586,For the first time?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2697.586,2698.081,Yes.
1974.73-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2698.081,2699.444,In a military case?
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2699.444,2700.593,Exactly.
1974.73-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.409,2739.148,But the Solicitor General said the habeas corpus is just fine even in this case.
1974.73-1346,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2739.148,2755.512,"Well, the Solicitor General says habeas corpus is fine even here but we have just gone through to trial and I am suggesting that if collateral review is ever proper and I will accept this concession such as it is that is proper."
1974.73-1346,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.669,2867.475,Thank you Mr. Boudin.
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2870.213,2892.494,"Just to make the observation Mr. Chief Justice that in this case, there is no charge that anything in military done has done has not been done in good faith and that what is being told to us here is that we must take this case in a rather hypothetical basis now and discuss the constitutional issue had we followed this procedural all the way through."
1974.73-1346,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2901.238,2903.879,Is the entire record of that original trial under seal?
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2903.879,2907.119,I believe it is Your Honor on a need to know basis.
1974.73-1346,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2907.119,2907.762,Everything?
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2907.762,2921.487,It is and the -- nothing that the documents used in that original trial because of the access problem are not going to be use 15 that were not going to be use in this trial and that only nine documents are going to be used in this trial.
1974.73-1346,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2944.059,2964.045,Would it be fair to say Mr. Solicitor General unless has been said so far in this case that the more sensitive the material involved in an alleged espionage case the less possibility there is of successful prosecution?
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2964.045,2993.555,"Well, if the rule is, Mr. Chief Justice, that no limitation of any source upon the use of notes is ever possible then of course it follows that more sensitive the material the less possible it is ever to prosecute anybody because if sensible limitations can’t be use upon the review with which the documents flow to the world and which notes are allowed out to flows to the world then I think prosecution is often impossible."
1974.73-1346,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3002.667,3011.569,"Mr. Solicitor General, what restrictions if any were imposed with respect to the nine documents that are to be used in the trial?"
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3011.569,3034.907,"The restrictions as a matter stands now Sergeant DeChamplain -- the military restrictions imposed by Sergeant DeChamplain his military counsel, his civilian league counsel, one associate I believe, one secretary, one foreign policy expert and one classification systems expert may all have access to the documents."
1974.73-1346,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.84,3095.091,"General Bork, it’s not that it’s important but why have the secretary look at it, he can't copy it?"
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3095.091,3095.769,"Well, you can --"
1974.73-1346,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.769,3096.877,You have a call on that?
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3096.877,3106.927,I think Mr. Justice Marshall that they can make notes and I suppose the secretary can take dictation from it if they wish and write the notes up.
1974.73-1346,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.216,3117.949,"Secretary has very low clearance of -- I just don’t understand why the secretary agreed, not that it’s important to this case."
1974.73-1346,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3117.949,3127.062,"Well, I don’t know why they negotiated the secretary into the deal Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.73-1346,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3127.062,3127.811,Thank you gentlemen.
