1997.96-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.658,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-795, Allentown Mack Sales and Service v. National Labor Relations Board."
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,55.358,58.21,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.434,169.725,"Well, why is it contradictory?"
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,246.728,247.63,"Well, I don't--"
1997.96-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,247.63,248.22,How is that irrational?
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,248.22,276.007,"--No, I don't... I think it's not rational, given the predisposition of the board... the court, me, the... everyone, that a poll or an election is a much, much better preferred test to measure employee sentiment than what is... what has been for 40 years the board's articulated standard in Celanese that an employer can withdraw without a poll."
1997.96-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.007,288.035,I understood your claim to be here... if... perhaps it's a claim of irrational... that the board's requirements for taking a poll are so stringent that they almost make a poll unnecessary.
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,288.035,306.418,"Well, they make it irrelevant, a legally irrelevant act, the board's regulatory scheme that accepts as valid a secret ballot poll only, and only if the employer has so much evidence before taking the poll that it could have withdrawn recognition without it."
1997.96-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.418,328.533,"Well, are you saying that if the... if the standard of cause that were applied to each of these three options were something less than what you characterize as the head count, that there would be nothing irrational, nothing to... nothing really to object to in having the three options subject to the same factual condition?"
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,328.533,343.396,"Well, I suppose a reasonable doubt, if it were different from a head count and, indeed, it were applied as if it were the totality of the circumstances, perhaps the complaint wouldn't be so vehement, but--"
1997.96-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.396,346.245,"Well, but would it be... would the scheme be irrational?"
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,346.245,350.8,"--Yes, I think it would be irrational to mandate the same requirement--"
1997.96-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,350.8,351.35,Okay.
1997.96-795,0,42049,stephen_d_shawe,,351.35,355.501,"--for a withdrawal of recognition without a poll, because--"
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1748.845,1751.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.309,1794.276,"Yes, but the board also allows an employer to call an election, call a... take a poll if the employer has a reasonable doubt--"
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1794.276,1795.365,--That is correct.
1997.96-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.365,1796.847,--about the employee support.
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1810.526,1810.787,I--
1997.96-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1810.787,1816.811,But in fact it is in practice asking for something more than that.
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1829.35,1830.702,--Justice--
1997.96-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1830.702,1847.603,"They have to know the answer by a head count before they say it will justify polling the employees, and it's just such a bizarre case here, where, in fact, the poll shows of course there was a reasonable doubt."
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1854.29,1857.422,"--Justice O'Connor, I have a couple of answers to your question."
1997.96-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.26,1869.27,The board is using it like beyond a reasonable doubt.
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1872.673,1874.065,"--To the contrary, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.764,1888.325,I see.
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1891.289,1893.751,I... I'd be... the board--
1997.96-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.751,1900.265,"I mean, a reasonable doubt means he is doubtful for good reason whether the board... whether the union has majority status."
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1901.515,1912.094,"--Justice Scalia, the board has to develop its policies in the course of adjudication, and in the course of adjudication I think the board has been quite candid that this is a tough standard and is difficult to meet."
1997.96-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.094,1914.408,"So it is not a reasonable doubt standard, then."
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1916.378,1921.072,"Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, the term doubt does have two different meanings."
1997.96-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.891,1940.385,Doubt... I simply don't understand the... your statement that doubt means disbelief.
1997.96-795,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1948.49,1951.383,--I... I... this is how the board uses the term--
