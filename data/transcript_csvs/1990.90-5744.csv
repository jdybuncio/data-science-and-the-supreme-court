1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.516,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-5744, Richard L. Chapman and Others v. the United States."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,9.026,13.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,89.971,94.622,"What's the relation of a gram to an ounce or a pound, Mr. Kelly?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,94.622,98.836,There are 28 or about 28 grams in an ounce.
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.836,100.417,28 grams in an ounce.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,100.417,100.987,Uh-huh.
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,100.987,117.909,"Well, when the LSD is put on the paper, does it remain a microdot or does it... it spread to the boundaries of the paper if the paper is big enough, and how big is the paper?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,117.909,123.573,There are actually two different ways of placing LSD on blotter paper.
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.285,146.727,How... how big is a square?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,146.727,148.548,A square is about 1-inch square.
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.548,149.569,About an inch square.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,149.569,150.39,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.39,151.379,I have one other technical question.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,151.379,151.87,Sure.
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.87,160.316,"When LSD is transported to this person who is going to put it on the blotter paper, I take it it's not pure, is it?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,168.611,175.125,"It's not cut in the sense that cocaine, for instance, is cut by mixing it with mannitol."
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.125,176.657,Perhaps I should have said mixed.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,176.657,187.182,"Generally if LSD is being distributed in liquid form in a vial, Justice Kennedy, it would be done in a fairly high point in the distribution chain."
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.473,207.567,"Well, as it goes to the person who's going to put it on the blotter paper, what kind of container is it in and is it mixed with anything else?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,207.567,212.959,It's probably going to be in something like a vial.
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.056,236.304,"Before you end with the so-called technical questions, I didn't understand your response to Justice Kennedy to explain what happens when the substance hits the blotter paper."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,241.87,245.341,It does penetrate into the fibers.
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.933,253.896,"So, in a sense, one could say it is mixed with the fibers of the blotter paper?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,253.896,262.584,"It depends, Justice O'Connor, in what sense one is using the term mixture as to whether that would constitute a mixture."
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.264,266.224,"Well, in some sense one could say that."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,266.224,267.496,--In some sense one could say that.
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,301.578,310.282,"I still didn't understand that one half of your answer... one that's... when is a dot is put on a square, does the dot expand to the full area of the square?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,310.282,314.767,"No, it will probably expand somewhat, but it won't cover the entire square."
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.767,320.21,"But it doesn't cover the entire square, so the square would be partly just blotter paper and then it would get increasingly concentrated as it gets to the middle."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,320.21,321.221,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.221,325.804,"But if it's sprayed on, it extends to the full extent of the square?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,325.804,329.707,"That's correct, because generally it's going to sprayed across the entire sheet."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.707,333.069,It doesn't really matter whether it's a mixture.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,351.289,358.705,"Certainly there is a sense in which blotter paper is a substance, as is any material thing."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.705,359.636,Yes.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,359.636,367.902,Interestingly the majority in the case below suggested that blotter paper is probably not a substance in that sense and found that it was a mixture.
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.339,446.352,"Well, why isn't that the case... I don't see why that's not the case with respect to the blotter as well."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,474.021,477.383,"That's really not the case with LSD, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.022,526.815,"Well, why is there a dose of LSD and there is not a dose of cocaine?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,526.815,528.515,LS--
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.515,531.259,I mean you speak as though it doesn't matter how strong it is.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,532.669,542.656,"--LSD is distributed in relatively standardized doses that tend to be, as I indicated, about 50 millionths of a gram."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.617,546.198,It is or it must be?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,546.198,547.78,--It is.
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.921,566.021,"Well, but unless it must be, then I am correct that the more blotter paper you use, the more distribution you can make, just as the more... whatever you mix cocaine with... you use the more distribution you can make."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,566.021,574.707,"Well, the... it's correct, Justice Scalia, that if you have more LSD, you need more blotter paper in order to distribute it to the market."
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.763,607.128,"Are you saying there's a standard dose of LSD, but there's not a standard dose of cocaine?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,607.128,610.371,Cocaine is sold in--
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,610.371,612.801,I mean so far as the person who is going to ingest it?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,612.801,616.895,"--Justice Kennedy, cocaine is sold by weight."
1990.90-5744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.79,625.651,But he can vary that.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,636.597,652.538,"I guess the difference is that if a user goes out and buys a quarter gram of cocaine, the user has a choice of how much cocaine he's going to consume at one time."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.425,667.017,"Well, some people would say taking the first dose didn't give him much benefit."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,667.228,670.079,"I would certainly agree with that, Chief... Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,670.079,673.092,Isn't... I guess I have two questions about your argument.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,712.929,723.995,It's not in the sense that the purpose of the cutting agent or the diluent is to multiply the amount of the drug that's available for sale.
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.995,732.711,"Well, that... I guess that gets to the second question I wanted to ask, and it's something that you came close to in responding to one of Justice Scalia's questions."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,798.624,809.16,"It's true that as a practical matter, it's generally necessary to have some sort of a carrier in order to deliver the LSD conveniently to a consumer."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,809.16,812.834,"Well, you... as a practical matter you couldn't sell it on the street without doing that, could you?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,812.834,825.911,"Well, there have been cases and there's one cited in my reply brief in which an individual ingested liquid LSD directly into his eyeball, apparently from a pipette or a... something akin to an eye dropper, but that's not--"
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.911,831.464,"But if that were the only way you could sell LSD, the market for LSD would... would be considerably less, wouldn't it?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,831.744,833.216,"--It would probably diminish greatly, Your Honor, yes."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.216,833.637,Okay.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,833.637,844.863,I think my point is that it's certainly a... probably a unique property of LSD that it is so infinitesimal in size that it requires a carrier.
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.506,867.32,"Well, no... no one is saying here that if you put the blotter paper in a paper bindle or an envelop that you're going to weigh the envelop."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,870.222,880.78,"I think the more apt analogy, Justice Souter, is that if you took a piece of blotter paper and folded it into a bindle and used it to carry cocaine, nobody would weigh the blotter paper."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.533,894.298,For the... for the simple reason that you can easily distinguish in your analogy... in your example you can easily distinguish between the cocaine and the blotter paper.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,907.378,919.856,"--I don't think that Congress had in mind, Justice Souter, that the ingestability was the factor that would count something as a mixture or substance."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.135,942.08,But... but there is a correlation between the means used to prepare something for ingestion and the breadth of its potential distribution.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,952.676,968.126,"Again, the fact that LSD requires a carrier, Justice Souter, does not to me to suggest that Congress intended to weigh that carrier when Congress isn't weighing any other kinds of drug carriers."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.212,979.496,How do you... are you using the term carrier as a word of art?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,979.496,984.418,I'm using carrier as a generic term for something that transports a drug.
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.418,990.633,Some... something that... a suitcase would likewise be a carrier?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,990.633,993.184,"I would say a suitcase would be a carrier, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.184,997.545,"Well, this is a fairly unique carrier then, because it's... the drug is actually mixed in with it, isn't it?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,997.545,1005.85,"Yes, the drug is... the... I don't know if mixed in with it is a correct term in practice."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1005.85,1009.223,"Well, I thought, in answering one of the previous questions, you said that it did mix?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1009.223,1012.616,"I think that the term can be read that broadly, sure."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.616,1024.964,"So that would distinguish this carrier at any rate from carriers which are, you know, like... like a suitcase, a box, a bottle, something like that, where there... where there isn't any combination."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1024.964,1033.739,"I think that's a distinguishing feature, but again I don't see that as a feature that would motivate Congress to want to weigh that carrier."
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.406,1053.304,"Well, [inaudible] dealt particularly with LSD, and it used those words, LSD?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1054.033,1056.055,Congress used--
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.055,1057.596,--What do you think it meant?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1057.596,1060.808,--Congress used those words with regard to every drug in section 841.
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.808,1061.97,"Yes, but it also did it with LSD."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1061.97,1062.839,Correct.
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.439,1067.032,"Well, what did it mean... what did it mean then?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1067.032,1068.422,--I think what Congress--
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.422,1076.779,"Suppose... suppose the LSD was... you put a little drop of LSD in a... in some orange juice, would that be a mixture?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1076.779,1080.069,--LS... if... a single--
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.069,1082.132,"Well, would it... would it be a mixture?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1082.132,1085.314,"--Again, I think that the word can be certainly be read broadly enough that it could be."
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.314,1086.814,Well--
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1086.814,1089.957,But I don't think that Congress intended it to be within the meaning of the statute.
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.957,1091.917,"--Well, what did it mean with respect to LSD?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1091.917,1093.52,I believe that--
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.52,1096.091,They apparently believed that LSD could be mixed with something.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1096.091,1097.881,"--Sure, it could be mixed for instance--"
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.881,1102.566,"And if it... if it was mixed with something, you weighed the mixture."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1102.566,1104.527,--I think when it's mixed--
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.527,1104.947,Is that right?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1104.947,1112.242,--When it's mixed with alcohol in order to... which does to some degree increase the volume when it's being sprayed... I think it's very appropriate to weigh that.
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.127,1147.856,"I take it then you suggest that we should just forget about the words mixture or substance, when LSD is involved, because LSD is always... when it's sold, it's always being carried in something else."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1147.856,1155.88,"--No, as... as I indicated I think there are situations when these words are very meaningful in the context of LSD."
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.461,1157.78,Tell me again.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1157.78,1160.732,--When it's being mixed with alcohol in order to spray it.
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.155,1187.13,"So at least you say that you ought to weigh not just the LSD in a dose, but the alcohol it's been mixed with?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1187.13,1187.791,Correct.
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1188.783,1203.382,So you're... you... you're saying that for purposes of the statute that... there cannot be a mixture unless the medium of mixing can be varied in such a way as to dilute the drug itself more or less.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1215.189,1218.071,"--That's essentially true, Justice Souter."
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1218.071,1240.695,"But your argument rests then I think on the assumption that there cannot be a mixture within congressional purpose unless the mixture gives a means of varying concentration, whereas it seems to me that the purpose of Congress was to deal with mixture as a means of varying the ease of distribution."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1255.124,1263.53,I think we have to keep in mind that section 841(b) is not a statute that prohibits the use of blotter paper.
1990.90-5744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.697,1314.834,"When he's selling it on blotter paper as opposed to selling in it a jar or a tube, he is selling it in a way which makes it more likely to reach more people."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1343.234,1352.859,"I think, Justice Souter, that in order to interpret the statute, one has to divine what Congress meant by the term mixture or substance."
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1369.18,1378.605,"Are you going to address your constitutional argument, because assuming we disagree with you on the statutory question, I suppose that's what you're left with?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1378.605,1381.706,"I would be happy to do that, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.618,1384.338,"Before you do that, can I ask you one more question?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1384.338,1384.819,--Sure.
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.819,1388.772,There have been an awful lot of factual discussion in the opinion below and in the briefs and in the argument.
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1401.12,1407.983,"In the record in the Chapman case, there is very little."
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.443,1423.454,Are they also experts on the methods of distribution in the illegal drug trade and all?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1427.648,1428.687,--There are a number cited in the briefs.
1990.90-5744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.332,1437.613,"There doesn't seem to be any controversy, but I'm just a little concerned about the... okay."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1437.613,1452.523,"With regard to the constitutional question, if the Government's interpretation of the law is correct, the question becomes whether basing sentences on what amounts to a completely arbitrary factor violates the right to due process of law."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.523,1456.847,"Now, what line of cases are you relying on for that proposition?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1456.847,1468.205,"Essentially we're relying on a number of cases that, in a variety of contexts, have held that due process prohibits the Government from being arbitrary."
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.205,1471.776,What's... what's your... what do you think is the best case you have going for you?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1471.776,1475.399,I guess it's hard to pick out which one is the best.
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.051,1484.533,"Well, those are really quite far afield from this subject."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1484.533,1489.558,"--They're far afield, but the principle, the underlying principle, is the same."
1990.90-5744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1491.979,1500.565,But has this Court ever thrown out a legislative sentence on the grounds that you're urging here?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1503.166,1516.527,"I'm not aware of one in which sentencing scheme has been thrown out, but I'm not aware of any sentencing scheme that has based sentences on a factor that is completely... as completely arbitrary as the one that exists in this case."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.527,1518.446,What about Weems and Solem?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1527.443,1528.972,I--
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.972,1534.887,Isn't it a disproportion... disproportionateness of sentencing that you're mainly complaining about?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1534.887,1543.522,"--Disproportionateness of sentences is one aspect of it, and that's an aspect that respondent Marshall raised in his brief and that was the focus of his argument."
1990.90-5744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.756,1551.309,"Well, I thought it... I thought it's your only criticism."
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1553.14,1557.933,It's... disproportionality is certainly part and parcel of our argument.
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.95,1587.573,"--They have it within their own power to remedy those disparities, don't they?"
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1590.893,1609.446,"They could, although I think it's doubtful that any LSD dealer who was ever aware that something like this could happen, and in any event whether they can choose their own poison or not, I think the Constitution still requires that sentences not be meted out in an entirely arbitrary way."
1990.90-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.567,1613.009,Why do you seize on the due process clause?
1990.90-5744,0,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,1616.451,1617.691,I... that's correct.
1990.90-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.913,1635.643,"Very well, Mr. Kelly."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1637.846,1644.357,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.334,1669.786,"Well, where are you getting these facts?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1669.786,1677.25,--The facts that are not in the record I will clearly identify to you as being told to me by chemists at the DEA.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.328,1735.319,Does that make it a... which does it make it... a mixture or a substance?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1735.319,1737.51,You can I think accurately describe it either way.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.791,1742.863,"Well, supposing he... he sprayed furniture polish on the top of a table."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1748.146,1749.598,--I don't think so.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.913,1758.775,"Well, they're stuck together... aren't they stuck together in precisely the same way the--"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1758.775,1766.81,"--Well, I mean if you polished them in and... so that the... it becomes absorbed into the wood, then what you have is a mixture of the wood with the polish."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.109,1816.29,--And you think that that's all that's needed to comply with it?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1816.29,1816.881,Correct.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.881,1820.474,So suppose I'm a... I'm not a distributor of LSD at all.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1841.108,1843.319,"Correct, if you distribute it."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.705,1855.377,"Oh, okay, it does not apply to users?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1855.377,1859.09,Users are punished under a different statute if you only have it for personal use.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.661,1861.821,"Okay, so if I buy two squares, however--"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1861.821,1863.432,"--And you distribute it, then yes."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.432,1869.536,"--And I make one orange juice for me and one for my friend and hand the orange juice to... for my friend, I'm a big time distributor?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1869.536,1874.411,"You are, under the statute in that case, eligible for a 10-year sentence and I might--"
1990.90-5744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1874.411,1878.211,"Because you could... you could invite ten friends to drink the orange juice, couldn't you?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1878.211,1879.252,--You could or as many as--
1990.90-5744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1879.252,1881.393,You couldn't do that with a little piece of blotter paper?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1881.393,1881.954,--Correct.
1990.90-5744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.215,1900.517,You say one-eighth or one-quarter.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1902.197,1902.828,Yes.
1990.90-5744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.828,1908.441,Or one-eighth inch square... a square with... with a size of one-eighth inch--
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1908.441,1909.052,Correct.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.456,1933.328,--May I go back just to the orange juice example for a minute?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1946.016,1952.581,"I think not, because what you would have probably is a dilution factor."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.581,1956.013,Is... can this stuff be diluted so much that it's no longer effective?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1956.013,1957.125,"Yes, it can."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.218,1970.572,"So if 25 micrograms were dumped in an 8-ounce glass of orange juice, it would not have... it really would only be useful to sell to one person?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1970.572,1973.083,Effectively.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.924,1976.375,Yes.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1976.375,1984.6,"But I think petitioner has pointed out that there is some sort of uniform amount that is distributed in this regard, and according to the DEA they've told me that that's not necessarily the case."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.562,1998.932,"But it is true... it is true if whatever that normal minimum amount is is consumed on a blotter paper in the one case, sugar cube in another, and a glass of orange juice on the other, there will be dramatic differences in the sentence to which the distributor would be exposed?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1998.932,1999.551,--Correct.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.296,2009.839,And even though it doesn't increase the number of likely purchasers of the substance?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2009.839,2011.96,"--Well, if you were only taking one at a time--"
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.96,2012.31,That's right.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2012.31,2013.121,--then that might be true.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.121,2013.582,Yes.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2013.582,2020.554,"But respondent... but petitioners for example are accused also of being irrational, but they themselves subject... are subject to some of the same irrationalities."
1990.90-5744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.791,2065.995,"Well, that would be true for cocaine or something else, would it not?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2078.822,2079.422,--Precisely.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.912,2296.008,"Mr. Larkin, how do you distinguish... as I assume you do... the blotter from the suitcase or the glass or the bottle?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2308.346,2311.388,"Yes, that is a reasonable way of looking at it."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.665,2325.236,That's right.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2325.236,2326.908,"It's only when you're using the word ""substance""."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.125,2355.577,LSD on... on a what?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2355.998,2356.489,--Tablet.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.836,2357.768,Uh-huh.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2357.768,2361.03,LSD can be distribute in pill form.
1990.90-5744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.17,2382.485,The tablets being originally some other drug than LSA... LSD I take it?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2382.485,2385.336,"--Well, I wouldn't necessarily call them a drug, Your Honor."
1990.90-5744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.848,2388.969,Sugar or sucrose or--
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2388.969,2389.899,--Matters like that.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.756,2453.869,"--Just once again, Mr. Larkin, what does the Government contend is the test for whether it's a substance containing?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2453.869,2465.439,"I think the way Justice Souter put it, and the way you tried to summarize it, is a... is a reasonable way of looking at it."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.186,2551.446,"Would that definition of... would that definition apply if they put the blotter paper in your mouth, say, and sucked it like a tablet, and then... once you got the LSD off you spit out the blotter paper?"
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2551.446,2555.417,"--It would, because that's taking a substance in through a mucus membrane in the mouth."
1990.90-5744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2559.341,2564.093,"Yes, but the blotter... the blotter paper isn't going through the mucus membrane."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2564.093,2565.655,--If... the blotter--
1990.90-5744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2565.655,2572.056,I thought you were defining mixture as that which could be ingested in any one of these four ways in combination with the drug.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2575.569,2578.531,"--Well, I was... I was focusing not on mixture, Your Honor, but more on substance."
1990.90-5744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2579.382,2580.333,I misunderstood.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2580.333,2582.675,--can readily be said to be the mixture.
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.675,2583.754,"Well, I don't think that's the confusion."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2594.953,2597.095,"No, I think if--"
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.095,2602.057,"What... what you mean by ingested is place it within the body, even if you spit it out later."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2602.057,2603.699,"--Yes, in a... in a broad sense right."
1990.90-5744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.29,2605.009,Right.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2606.011,2607.102,Correct.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.873,2623.732,"I just... maybe this is another absurd hypothetical, but if the blotter paper were dipped in the glass of orange juice and left there long enough for the stuff to... I take it it would leave the blotter paper and become associated with the orange juice."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2633.199,2634.047,"--Oh, it doesn't necessarily have to be."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.047,2634.478,Yes.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2634.478,2640.402,"If you put the blotter paper in the glass of orange that Justice White hypothesized, you would count we think the weight of the orange juice."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.376,2648.867,"No, but at the time it's sold, it's carried by the blotter paper."
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2667.439,2670.161,"Yes, if you went about it that way, it would not necessarily enter the body."
1990.90-5744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.161,2671.523,--It doesn't have to be necessarily.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2683.071,2686.664,"I think so, and I think... I think that was the way you originally put it, which is why I tried to answer it that way."
1990.90-5744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.664,2694.067,Do the briefs indicate the percentage of times that blotter paper is used for distribution?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2695.399,2698.29,"The briefs do not, Your Honor."
1990.90-5744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2729.621,2737.495,Does the literature or anything that we can rely on tell us that blotter paper is used 40 percent of the time by distributors or 20 percent?
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2737.495,2742.36,"I can't... I do not know a particular source, but what I can point to you is this."
1990.90-5744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2758.048,2759.801,I think we'll leave it at that.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2768.466,2772.897,"Well, Your Honor, the reason I used... I used tend is... I made a mistake."
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.494,2784.487,Let me give you another absurd hypothetical.
1990.90-5744,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2797.784,2799.797,I'm sure it would make it easier to apprehend them.
1990.90-5744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.969,2803.908,"Well, they don't sign these."
