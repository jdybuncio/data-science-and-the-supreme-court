1995.94-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.208,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94 896, BMW of North America v. Ira Gore."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,8.819,11.991,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,84.039,84.97,Mr. Frey--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,85.178,85.699,--I'm sorry.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.699,91.593,"Mr. Frey, I guess Alabama at the time did not have a statute--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,91.593,91.903,That's correct.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.903,93.465,--in effect dealing with the subject.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,93.465,93.964,That's correct.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.964,104.183,And do you question whether Alabama courts could properly find some award of punitive damages here for at least the conduct--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,104.183,104.914,"Well, I--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.914,106.123,--that occurred in Alabama at that time?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,106.123,108.246,"--I do question it, although I'm not questioning it in this case."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.246,110.385,"It's not before us in this case, is it?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,110.385,115.378,"See, I believe that what you have here is actually a species of malum prohibitum and not malum in se."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.378,119.422,But we take it on the assumption that--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,119.422,121.102,The conduct is punishable--
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.102,122.294,--punitive damages could be awarded--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,122.294,123.373,--In Alabama.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.373,123.644,--in Alabama--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,123.644,124.455,"Yes, that's correct."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.455,126.765,--at the time this incident occurred.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,126.765,127.837,At the time of the sale of this car.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.837,154.034,"Now, do we also assume that it would be perfectly proper during the course of trial for evidence to be admitted on the existence and frequency of similar conduct outside of Alabama to show a course of conduct or the defendant's state of mind or something of that sort?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,154.034,156.124,"Again, we are not challenging that."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.349,170.564,"Well, haven't there been many cases, including ones decided by this Court, where evidence--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,170.564,171.075,Yes.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.075,175.679,--of other similar conduct outside the jurisdiction has been admitted?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,175.679,182.462,"Absolutely, and there's no question, for instance, if it were admissible for Rule 404(b) kind of purposes under the Federal Rules of Evidence--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.462,184.585,"Well, just admissible to prove the intent--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,184.585,185.795,"--Right, now if intent--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.795,187.468,--and the egregiousness of the injury.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,187.468,198.794,"--That's true, and I think my problem with it, and it may not be a constitutional problem, it's a kind of rule 403 problem, that it's highly prejudicial in a case like this, where it was agreed that there was a policy and there was no question of intent--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.794,200.373,"Well, again, do we assume--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,200.373,201.134,--You can assume--
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.134,205.538,--here that the evidence of conduct out of State properly was admissible?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,205.538,205.959,"--You can assume that, yes."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.679,208.25,Okay.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,208.25,209.061,--and we're not challenging that.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.061,239.85,"Does this case boil down to kind of a fluke because it was submitted to the jury on this multiplier theory instead of... what if the jury... what if it had not been presented to the jury that way, and just the egregiousness of what happened to the plaintiff here, and the fact that similar instances occurred elsewhere, it was a standard practice of the company, could the jury properly have awarded the 4 million in punitives based on conduct in Alabama alone?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,239.85,240.911,No.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.711,257.331,Well--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,257.331,258.673,"--and if so, whether inadequate remedy was--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.673,263.616,"--I know you are, but is that because this case has peculiar facts?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,264.207,288.142,"--This case I think, Justice O'Connor, highlights what is more submerged in a lot of other cases, product liability, or mass tort, or consumer fraud cases where you have nationwide conduct, which is the invitation to the jury to punish the defendant not only for the conduct that was done in the State or to the plaintiff, or plaintiffs in the case, but to punish them for their national conduct."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.142,292.745,"--But Mr. Frey, that came in only because a lawyer said it in summation."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,312.698,313.058,On any--
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.058,315.449,--and the Alabama supreme court said it's dead wrong.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,324.775,334.081,"--Well, I'm not... except for the unconstitutionality of the holding of the Alabama supreme court, I'm not sure that I am, but I don't accept your premise that there was not a proper objection."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.453,338.366,Where was the objection... I didn't see it... to the lawyer's summation?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,338.366,342.156,"--No, it wasn't during the summation, but what happened was there was a motion in limine."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.155,373.167,"Mr. Frey, there was no objection after the lawyer made that statement in summation, and isn't it common--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,373.167,376.25,The court had already ruled that that was a permissible use of the evidence.
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.25,380.341,"--Well, perhaps we won't... I don't want to detract you on this any longer--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,380.341,380.591,No.
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.042,395.18,--but you can give me the place in the record where the judge makes an error of law in saying it's proper for the jury to take into account the... to use as a multiplier sales in other States.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,395.18,421.46,"--Well, I think you'd have to look at page 451 to see our argument, of the transcript... the Clerk's record, I'm sorry, and then at 585 to 591 of the Clerk's record, but I believe that what happened here was that we said this improper use is going to be made and in fact Mr. Bolt, counsel for Dr. Gore, said they wanted to use it on damages."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.878,455.211,"But Mr. Frey, even if you were right about what the record would reveal, and even if we can pass over that there was no objection to the statement that was made, the Alabama supreme court itself said, such evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the civil penalty."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,455.211,473.453,"--I agree, and I am willing to accept that as the premise and proceed to the question, which is really the question we presented, whether the use of that evidence to set the size of the civil penalty was properly remedied by the reduction of the punitive damages award from 4 million to 2 million."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,473.453,475.784,May I just ask you one question before you get into that?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,498.371,504.114,I don't... I believe it is true... the situation is this.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.873,506.395,"Well, let me just tell you what my question is, then--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,506.395,506.666,--Okay.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,506.666,532.943,"--My question is, in those States in which... which had adopted this 3 percent rule, is it also the case, as counsel on the other side have claimed, that the common law fraud action was preserved and any plaintiff in any of those other States could still have brought a common law fraud action based upon repairs, undisclosed repairs, even though they did not amount to 3 percent of the cost?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,532.943,541.517,"Well, the answer to that is, the action might not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or preemption, but the action would have been, I believe, bound to fail."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.746,591.801,Did you understand the court's reasoning to be that had it not exceeded it would have been no fraud cause of action?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,591.801,592.73,--I think that was implicit--
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.73,593.05,Okay.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,593.05,596.333,--in the fact that their decision turned on whether or not it exceeded it.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.333,600.195,Is there... I take it that is the extent of the out of state discussion of the subject.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,600.195,616.006,"There's a case called Tesh v. Best Motors, decided by the court of appeals in Wisconsin on August 15, 1995, and the cite I have is 1995 Westlaw 478413, which is to the same effect."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.156,646.886,"Well, it's not... why is it Kafkaesque?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,665.008,689.484,"Well, I guess... I guess my problem with this is that if virtually every State that has considered this conduct has found that there... that in a statute, has set a statutory threshold... those statutes are passed to balance the interests of consumers, and having information that's important to them, with the interests of the business community in doing business free from restrictions that may increase costs or have other adverse effects."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.387,709.657,"Well, it may be hard to say, but do you... are you saying or would you argue that the courts of Alabama should have instructed the jury that so long as the damage did not reach this 3 percent threshold that as a matter of law it could not be considered as--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,709.657,710.478,--No.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,710.819,711.077,--Okay.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,711.077,712.279,We're not saying that to this Court.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.58,715.251,So aren't you then making a jury argument to us?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,715.251,715.512,--No.
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,758.15,766.425,"Mr. Frey, I think that that argument is not genuinely in the case, and let me tell you why."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,817.336,824.873,"Well, but the issue we're raising is that we believe the Constitution prohibits it from doing that, and the reason we believe that--"
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.873,832.607,Let's just assume that the Alabama supreme court said the jury has determined liability.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,849.628,855.922,"--All right, and my answer to that is, what is wrong with that is that that is first of all not what they did."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,894.867,901.663,"Let me ask a question which is an alternative, or rests on the alternative of Justice Ginsburg's premise."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,943.351,946.951,I have no problem... I think this was Justice O'Connor's question in the beginning.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,990.381,994.172,"Was it punished, or was it used as a measure for enhancement in punishing the Alabama--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,994.172,1009.312,"It was used... in my view, you cannot let that kind of a subterfuge conceal the fact that the more activity which presumptively we have to assume was lawful in other States that was engaged in, the larger the punishment that Alabama is imposing on the defendant."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.888,1049.059,"--Well, the Alabama supreme court did grant a remittitur, and how do we know that what it did in granting the remittitur is somehow unconstitutional, and are you relying on the Due Proces Clause--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1049.059,1049.87,"Well, I have--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1049.87,1052.221,"--or the Commerce Clause, or what?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1052.221,1052.731,--Well--
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1052.731,1054.321,What principle is it--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1054.321,1054.652,--Okay--
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1054.652,1059.474,--that tells us what they did in granting the remittitur was unconstitutional?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1059.474,1062.427,"--I have two separate arguments, and I need to be clear about this."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1111.9,1114.422,"But Mr. Frey, I keep coming back to where the State has."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1137.326,1147.773,"No, but Your Honor, it's... there is a vast difference, and this Hicks case makes it clear, between determining the verdict that is proper for this conduct, and determining the largest constitu--"
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1147.773,1151.836,"--The Hicks case relied, as you read it, on a judge's charge."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1157.219,1170.789,"--If the jury had not believed, and had not punished for non Alabama sales, it presumably... we don't know for sure, but the best evidence is that it would have imposed a punishment of 56,000 if it--"
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.789,1172.649,--I'm forgetting what the jury does.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1172.649,1173.2,"--No, but you can't--"
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1173.2,1188.841,"I'm asking why we don't owe the Alabama supreme court the respect of saying that when it recognized that what the jury did was impermissible, it then substituted a figure that it thought a proper construction of the law, not permit--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1188.841,1195.634,"--No, what... it substituted a figure that it thought was the largest figure that... the largest amount that a jury could punish BMW."
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.651,1211.474,"--And conversely you're saying what is left is still a punishment for extraterritorial conduct and that's wrong, whether it's 2 million or 2."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1211.474,1211.835,No.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1217.078,1219.72,Because there wouldn't be any extraterritorial punishment.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1219.72,1220.471,That wouldn't... there would not be any.
1995.94-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1220.471,1222.071,"Yes, but so long as there's some extraterritorial punishment--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1222.071,1225.274,We are saying that we are still subject to extraterritorial punishment.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.674,1228.305,--And do you rely on the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1228.305,1229.487,"--No, the Due Process--"
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1229.487,1229.938,I have yet to hear your theory.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1229.938,1230.338,--No.
1995.94-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.636,1274.595,"Well, they're criminal cases."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1280.491,1284.212,"--Well, it might not, although certainly we're dealing with punishment here."
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1284.212,1292.727,But can't a State court in a criminal case consider conduct that occurs out of State at the time of imposing sentence--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1292.727,1292.967,Absolutely.
1995.94-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1292.967,1295.469,--to determine the sentence range?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1295.469,1295.769,Absolutely.
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.686,1311.991,"Mr. Frey, I'm glad we've come to this point, because I think it's a very important issue that we haven't considered in these punitive damages cases before."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1324.778,1329.833,I think the Constitution would permit the application of either Alabama or Tennessee law in that circumstance.
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1330.751,1335.605,"Well, could Alabama count the sales both in Tennessee and in Alabama?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1335.605,1337.236,"You mean one sale, and say--"
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.236,1337.537,No.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1343.78,1352.406,"--No, no, no, because... no, it can't do that, because it has no interest... it cannot take into account sales to residents of Tennessee or Illinois or some place that are made in Tennessee."
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1353.177,1356.04,"--But why not, if Alabama residents are going there to buy their cars?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1359.692,1360.862,"--Well, because I think the--"
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.862,1363.236,--If we have the metropolitan area around the District of Columbia--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1363.236,1367.537,"--Well, in Healy v. Beer Institute people were going to New York to buy the beer because it was cheaper."
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.531,1387.479,--But it seems to me that what we would have to do if we adopted your rule is to have a jurisprudence of apportionment something like our interstate tax jurisprudence.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1387.479,1393.934,"Well, the apportionment issue is very important, and it relates to a different question, which is our excessiveness argument."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.844,1412.787,And that aspect--
1995.94-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.787,1413.485,--Well--
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1413.485,1414.236,--is not quirky.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1433.541,1448.03,"I can't agree... well, in the narrow sense that it comes up here, that's true, but in the broader sense the question would be, is the defendant, for instance, entitled to have the jury told that they can't punish for conduct that occurs outside--"
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.03,1453.342,But the one issue... your second issue is the one that will be a continuing one.
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1464.469,1465.781,--Well--
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.781,1469.803,"--an issue as far as I can see it which will never repeat in this jurisdiction, and--"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1469.803,1500.062,"--Oh, it will repeat in a slightly different form where it's less obvious what's happening, in the form that is common in product liability cases, for instance, where the argument is made that there are so many thousands of people around the country who have bought this product, or been injured by it, or so many thousands... and the jury will be invited to punish for that without any kind of explicit mathematical formula, and that will raise a different problem, but the first step on that particular road is this case."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.062,1500.543,--I did--
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1510.321,1516.673,"Well, if the Court would hold that, I think that would be extremely valuable in the development of the law."
1995.94-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.673,1518.375,"Well, that's the marching orders that the Alabama supreme court has given."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1518.375,1530.504,"Well, it is less clear, and I can tell you from looking at this litigation around the country that this problem recurs in a slightly more insidious or less, you know, obvious form than it recurred in this case, but--"
1995.94-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.504,1532.585,Could you just say a word about excessiveness?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1537.078,1537.496,--It is.
1995.94-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1537.496,1541.1,"--you have 4,000 of damage of economic nature."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1569.219,1569.459,All right.
1995.94-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1569.84,1577.854,"But the problem... the problem is, is there not some Federal limitation and then, of course, it raises, what?"
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1580.536,1581.097,--The first part--
1995.94-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1581.097,1590.641,--that could be possible to prevent tremendous transfers of property on minimal evidence of significant harm?
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1590.641,1600.419,"--The first part of the problem, Justice Breyer, is not a problem any more because the Court has decided in Haslip and in TXO and in Honda that there does exist a substantive due process limit."
1995.94-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1600.419,1601.45,"But what, is the question."
1995.94-896,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1601.45,1611.188,"Now, I understand the question is what, and I think there are... the nature of the inquiry inherently cannot be reduced to a mathematical formula."
1995.94-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.843,1652.472,"Very well, Mr. Frey."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1654.325,1658.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.411,1747.254,Does the supreme court of Alabama insist that an objection be made during the course of argument?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1753.618,1756.47,"--Well, you can do it either then or at the end, but they do, Your Honor."
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1776.422,1782.956,Is that true even where there has been a motion in limine in advance of the argument and the issue is resolved?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1782.956,1788.52,"--Yes, because the motion in limine was only to the admissibility of the documents, not to... it did not address--"
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1788.52,1794.056,"Well, what if a motion in limine addressed or should be interpreted to address counsel's argument as well?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1794.056,1795.796,"--Well, it didn't--"
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.796,1797.076,"Well, suppose it did."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1797.076,1797.517,--Okay.
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.517,1803.912,Do you think Alabama law would then not permit a new trial?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1803.912,1805.364,"Well, I guess I don't know the answer to that."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.92,1916.344,"May I ask, Mr. Gottesman, in the remittitur proceeding did they also bring out the fact that in a lot of States these sales would not have been unlawful?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1916.344,1919.446,"--Well, they made the argument."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.06,1925.901,"There's no evidence that they would have been unlawful in any State, is there?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1925.901,1928.523,--That they would have been unlawful?
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.523,1930.726,"If there's a presumption of innocence, we would presume--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1930.726,1931.084,Right.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.525,1932.116,--all these sales were lawful.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1932.116,1934.056,"That's right, and the Alabama supreme court said--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.056,1935.689,And that was brought out at the remittitur hearing.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1935.689,1935.999,--Right.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.943,1946.864,Let me just be sure I understand.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1953.51,1955.2,"Yes, that there were--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.2,1955.43,That wasn't--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1955.43,1958.243,"--At the time they adopted the policy, 15 States had those statutes."
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.468,1967.478,--Including Alabama by the time of trial--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1967.478,1967.809,No.
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.159,1968.84,--is that right?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1968.84,1970.301,"--Well, Alabama by the time of trial, but after the sale in this case."
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1970.301,1971.222,"Right, which--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1971.222,1972.251,But the Alabama statute--
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1972.251,1972.922,--makes it particularly--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1972.922,1980.268,"--Well, except that the Alabama supreme court has construed that statute not to preempt the common law fraud action."
1995.94-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.268,1985.91,"--I was going to say, in your brief you make the claim that in your... of course, you could still have common law fraud in Alabama."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1994.977,1995.827,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.874,2008.455,"Well, it's really a matter of statutory interpretation--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2008.455,2008.836,"--Yes, of course."
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.836,2009.858,--in each State which has some--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2009.858,2010.599,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.599,2015.04,--I would think it would be very difficult to generalize one way or the other in the absence of decided cases.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2015.04,2024.146,"Well, of course, that's right, and Your Honor, the Alabama supreme court said as far as we're concerned, we don't think you should consider the sales out of State at all in determining the amount."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.417,2030.01,Why is it relevant to culpability?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2036.365,2040.566,"--Well, the... it's... they haven't shown that they complied with the law."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.566,2047.481,I thought you said to me a moment ago there was no example of a case anywhere in the States that reached the same result as the Alabama court did in this case.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2047.481,2049.201,"No, I... there's no case."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.743,2056.306,"So if you presume that the conduct is innocent unless proven guilty, there's no proof that they violated the law anywhere else."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2056.306,2056.908,"--No, that's right."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.908,2057.837,Right.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2061.199,2062.822,"Well, they concede it's relevant."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.891,2064.431,"Well, everybody concedes it."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2066.275,2070.004,"--The relevance is that it goes to show the, among other things we have a--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.004,2071.116,--A lot of lawful transactions.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2071.116,2071.897,--Pardon?
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.897,2075.507,It goes to show 983 lawful transactions.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2075.507,2079.321,"But it also goes to show why they... that it is a nationwide policy, that--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.321,2079.571,Right.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2079.571,2083.235,"--they are reluctant to change it, that they are making a profit off of the--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.235,2088.417,Why should their interest in either changing it or maintaining it be the business of the Alabama court?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2088.417,2091.018,"--Well, Your Honor, at best--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.018,2091.409,I don't understand.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2096.842,2097.103,--It doesn't.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.825,2100.326,Right.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2100.326,2102.817,--in determining the amount of punitive damages.
1995.94-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.782,2127.043,"But admittedly it was applied here by the jury, as has been determined by the Alabama supreme court, in a way that directly tried to affect the conduct of BMW in other States."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2127.043,2130.786,"--That's correct, and now I want to come back to where I was on the procedural posture."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.423,2179.206,"Did they say that they're going to recompute the amount, or... you're in direct disagreement here with your--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2179.206,2179.967,"--Yes, and I--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.967,2191.594,"--colleague, Mr. Frey, who says that it's clear under Alabama law that what the remittitur amounts to is a reduction of the verdict to the maximum constitutionally permissible amount."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2191.594,2192.946,"--All right, and that's exactly where--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.946,2193.517,You dispute that.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2193.517,2203.182,"--We do, and I've advised Mr. Frey that we would, because our brief didn't, and it's reading his reply brief that made us realize the following mistake."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.567,2322.602,"But why... if the Alabama court does what you suggest, if only in the pure excessiveness cases they reduce it to the constitutional maximum, but in error cases they reevaluate on their own, there is simply no explanation for the term, constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2327.255,2327.926,"Well, I--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.926,2330.056,--and that a remittitur of the 4 million jury verdict is appropriate.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2334.852,2335.189,--Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.189,2336.391,Why is the adverb there?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2336.391,2343.437,"Well, I think the adverb is there because they're saying that what made this one constitutionally unreasonable was the consideration of out of state conduct."
1995.94-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2420.895,2437.108,"Mr. Gottesman, if we don't know what operation the Alabama supreme court in fact performed, on a remittitur there are three, at least three positions, the highest a jury could award, the least that a jury, reasonable jury would award, and what the court itself thinks is reasonable."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2448.084,2453.728,"Well, in the case that we cite in this section of our brief, Clemons v. Mississippi, this Court had a similar problem."
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2493.304,2502.631,"Well, do you agree with the Alabama supreme court that the jury could not use the number of similar acts that a defendant committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2502.631,2507.182,"--Certainly, in the absence of evidence that it's unlawful in those States, we would agree that they--"
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2507.182,2512.245,And is that because of interstate commerce concerns or due process concerns?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2512.245,2513.717,--I think due process concerns--
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2513.717,2516.168,Well... well--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2516.168,2517.21,--but I want to be clear what we're agreeing to--
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.21,2521.192,--on interstate... does interstate commerce enter into the calculus?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2533.249,2538.163,--For conduct that didn't... did or did not occur in Alabama?
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.163,2544.358,"Well, the sale occurs in Alabama, they do business in Alabama, but the measure of disgorgement is profits nationwide."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2544.358,2550.352,"You know, we have a... there's a grossly excessive test under the Due Process Clause that this Court's--"
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.352,2555.175,What about... is there any interstate commerce objection to the statute that I hypothesize?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2555.175,2556.515,"--There might be, Your Honor."
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2563.52,2567.322,"In other words, you're not sure whether or not there is an interstate commerce problem."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2567.322,2577.13,I think the answer is I would not be sure... Alabama removed it by saying you can't... Alabama went further than both we and BMW thinks the Constitution requires.
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2582.703,2583.272,"Well, let's just--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2583.272,2584.063,"Now, we agree that Alabama--"
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2584.063,2604.537,"--Let's just assume that either a statute, and of course then we'll next get to the fact that our hypothetical jury instruction considers out of state conduct as a multiplier in fixing the amount of the award, or out of state profits as being part of the sum that must be disgorged to this plaintiff."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2609.498,2610.599,"--There might well be, Your Honor."
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2610.599,2612.162,And how do you... well--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2612.162,2616.063,Alabama has absolutely foolproof protections against that happening.
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.584,2634.646,"--Well, if you say there might well be, then I take it you concede the surface plausibility or reasonable content to the proposition that Alabama may not punish by way of damages for acts that have occurred out of State."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2634.646,2637.638,"--Stated that way, I agree with it, yes."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.733,2647.015,"Ah... ah... ah... ah... ah, that's a big qualifier you just threw in there."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2647.015,2647.813,"--Yes, of course."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.026,2652.327,I don't think Justice Kennedy had that qualifier in mind.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2652.327,2652.898,"--Well, here's my--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.898,2653.887,I didn't hear it in his question.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2653.887,2655.109,"--Yes, I understand, but here's my concern."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2672.931,2677.464,"Well, it certainly does in criminal cases where--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2677.464,2678.645,It takes account of out of state--
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.645,2679.817,--where recidivist criminals--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2679.817,2680.177,--Of course.
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.177,2685.6,--are punished more severely if they've committed crimes not only in that jurisdiction but in other jurisdictions.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2685.6,2697.197,"Of course, and that's the point I'm making, is that while Alabama can't say, we want to punish you for what you did in Texas, Alabama can say that in determining the quality and character of your actions in Alabama--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.197,2698.847,How bad a person you are.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2698.847,2710.435,"--Exactly... we can look to the conduct that you've engaged in in other States just as this Court has held that the Due Process Clause allows that in sentencing by a State in a... or by a Federal court, for that matter, in a criminal case."
1995.94-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.435,2737.122,"But implicitly you're relying, I guess, so far as analogies go, on the fact that in the criminal enhancement field we... at least there is no authority to the effect that it would be proper for a State to say, we will set our punishment for conduct in this State by multiplying a... you know, a particular term of years for every similar act that took place elsewhere."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2737.122,2739.333,"Well, in some sense, that's what a recidivist statute does."
1995.94-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2741.035,2741.816,"Well, if it does it like that--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2741.816,2745.638,"--You know, the three strikes you're out statutes are going to--"
1995.94-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2745.638,2745.908,--Yes.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2745.908,2749.46,--give a greatly increased punishment because of actions--
1995.94-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2749.46,2752.443,But it's harder... it's not a kind of a multiplier punishment.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2752.443,2754.193,--It may be much more than a multiplier.
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.193,2755.145,Do we really have--
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.145,2765.593,"--How much of our jurisprudence in the recidivist statutes do you think is dependent on the Double Jeopardy Clause, which of course doesn't have any applicability to a civil proceeding."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2765.593,2776.478,"Well, of course, Your Honor, but both due process and double jeopardy apply to the criminal proceedings, and to the extent that courts are allowed to do this in sentencing in a criminal case, it would seem to follow a fortiori that--"
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2776.478,2792.32,"Yes, but perhaps the reason that the courts have said that you're not sentencing again for the same conduct in a recidivist statute is because there would be a double jeopardy problem if you were, and you're not bound down by the double jeopardy clause in a civil proceeding."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2792.32,2794.26,"--Well, I think that's right."
1995.94-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.182,2812.102,"And it's not only double jeopardy, it's the problem that a State can't really, consistent with known juris prudential postulates, divide up a sentence and say, well now, you serve this part of your sentence in Nevada, and this part of your aggravated sentence back in California, where you committed the crime, but we can do that under the Commerce Clause."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2815.614,2825.219,"--Well, you know, I don't think the Court should take too much counsel from what I say about this, because since in this case Alabama has removed all these issues from the consideration--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.219,2827.262,"I'm saying, do we have to grapple with all of this?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2827.262,2827.893,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.893,2829.083,I thought that both you and--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2829.083,2829.353,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.353,2834.235,--your opponent concede that these out of state things should not have been considered by the jury.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2835.217,2835.587,Right.
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.068,2840.941,--for purposes of punishing those acts separately.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2840.941,2842.102,"--That's right, absolutely."
1995.94-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2844.143,2847.015,"But Mr. Gottesman, there is another multiplier that is alive."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2858.952,2859.774,--Okay.
1995.94-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.774,2865.588,"--Does every plaintiff get the 2 million, and what about the other States?"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2875.142,2878.464,"Okay, let me address that, Your Honor, because... and thank you for bringing me to that."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.951,2940.805,"Do you think that it was... in your brief, you argue that it was appropriate to deter the nationwide policy."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2942.087,2943.817,If we said that... I don't believe--
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.817,2944.919,You've said it over and over again.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2947.269,2947.59,"--Oh, I'm sorry, yes--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.59,2950.432,--this jolt was necessary to change a national policy.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2950.432,2951.254,"--Well, because--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.254,2953.754,Do you adhere to that position?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2953.754,2956.726,--If they would not stop in Alabama--
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.726,2959.098,You don't know whether they would have or not.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2966.544,2969.376,"--Well, that's right... it's always true, when you have to set punitive damages--"
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.376,2975.477,"Well, the respondent says that BMW had stopped shipping cars to Alabama by the time of this trial."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2975.477,2976.509,"--Well, that's right."
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.411,2982.032,"Well, does that make it--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2982.032,2987.217,"--immediately prior to this trial a phone call was made saying, don't send cars to Alabama."
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.708,3084.261,"--Well, there's no evidence they couldn't figure out a way to do it."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3084.261,3085.109,"Well, except--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.109,3088.222,The one phone call doesn't discuss all possibilities that--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3088.222,3088.813,"--Well, but it--"
1995.94-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.813,3090.626,--executives might think of faced with this problem.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3100.039,3100.47,"--Well, at least--"
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.47,3105.692,"You just have this one phone call, they got a problem in Alabama, this is the way we'll try to solve our Alabama problem."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3105.692,3106.744,--That's right.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.744,3107.415,That's all that shows.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3107.415,3113.339,"But recall that they were trying to solve the Alabama problem, and even then they couldn't find a way to do it, right--"
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.339,3113.679,Well--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3113.679,3116.04,--so they didn't proffer... they certainly didn't proffer a way to do it.
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.04,3121.153,--How many 2 million awards can Alabama give in a case like this--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3121.153,3121.874,Well--
1995.94-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.874,3122.485,--against BMW?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3122.485,3124.395,--It can only once deter them.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.238,3132.15,You would deter them with a judgment of a billion dollars--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3132.15,3132.951,"--Yes, sure."
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.951,3133.262,--Fine.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3135.052,3135.562,No.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.562,3137.465,"Or 5... my question, really, I want to get you back--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3137.465,3137.993,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.993,3139.065,--to what you were about to say.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3142.067,3142.407,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.407,3172.929,"All right, and you have two prongs to it, and I want to hear what you have to say, and what I'm thinking in my mind, though I'm not adopting it, is, is there some procedural aspect of due process that says when there is no obvious relationship between damages and minimal harm, when historically it can't be justified, at least the court has a procedural obligation to explain some rational theory, maybe a little stronger than a legislature, maybe the same, maybe weaker."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3180.702,3180.972,Okay.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.972,3182.883,Those are the... that's the excessive part that's--
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3182.883,3183.144,Okay.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3183.144,3185.124,"--bothering me, and I think you were going to discuss--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3185.124,3185.374,"Right, I do."
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3241.471,3243.945,"--explain, assume that's so."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3243.945,3244.333,Right.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3244.333,3244.824,Okay.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3244.824,3245.375,"Okay, now--"
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.375,3251.189,"Still, isn't there some obligation on a court under the Due Process Clause... and I'm not buying this."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3266.739,3267.13,--Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3267.13,3271.831,It is fairly small in amount compared to the amount of damages.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3271.831,3272.713,For this one person.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3272.713,3276.824,Is there not an obligation to explain some rational theory?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3279.696,3285.152,"Well, let me explain the rational theory, and I leave it to the Court whether the Court wants to say the Due Process Clause requires that."
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3290.004,3293.598,"But we would say it if that's the law, presumably, and what I want to know is--"
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3293.598,3299.63,--But I do want to tell you that they could rationally get there if they in fact did the thorough and painstaking review that they claim they did.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.195,3355.497,--Are you including the repainting jobs less than 300?
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3355.497,3355.747,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3355.747,3355.988,Yes.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3355.988,3356.626,I've got the point.
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3357.367,3358.018,Okay.
1995.94-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3358.018,3372.178,"--then wouldn't a rational connection be to take the total global amount of conceivable damages and divide by the number of potential lawsuits, and then you'd have a number, and that would be this person's rational share on such a theory."
1995.94-896,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3378.773,3381.413,"Well, I don't think it's right... and my time is up, Your Honor."
