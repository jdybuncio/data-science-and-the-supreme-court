2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.435,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,8.95,12.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.583,72.33,"Mr. Waxman, I thought the Ninth Circuit did decide that question in another case that was pending, Santos."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,72.33,74.782,"It did decide it in Santos, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.782,79.656,Why wasn't that the time at which it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had jurisdiction?
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,79.656,93.37,"Well, for reasons that we articulate, Your Honor, in a... I forget the footnote number, but a footnote in our brief, there are some important distinctions, although they turned out not to be dispositive, between the nature and position of this case and Santos."
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.198,141.757,"Are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction... a hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,143.1,148.128,"Well, I wouldn't have the most, the strongest argument that I have in this case."
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.344,210.306,"But if we accept that in the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable jurisdiction, or... it's something I made up, I suppose... is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to... in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting?"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,210.306,212.805,--I actually would not embrace that test.
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.011,286.73,"Mr. Waxman, may I just ask this question?"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,300.63,302.037,--Yes.
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,481.979,483.073,"--Well, am I wrong?"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,488.585,506.001,"The attorney... there were two cases in which the Guam Supreme Court issued a final... its own final ruling after the October 30, 2004 amendment of the Organic Act."
2006.06-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.425,561.213,"Mr. Waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold the petition if there were... if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to dispose of it."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,561.213,575.815,"Well, the attorney general could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment in this Court, you know, at any time prior to the time that the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing jurisdiction."
2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,601.088,604.398,"There's no sense in which it's redundant, though."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,607.865,608.317,Yes.
2006.06-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.631,692.55,"But isn't it just the case... you've made several arguments, but you have a case that's lodged in the court of appeals."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,696.407,697.094,--Right.
2006.06-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.094,711.948,"So in the normal course when you have a district court decision, a trial court decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,724.178,742.107,"Yes, and in fact... I mean, it's... I don't think that anything actually turns on this in the context of this case, but it is quite significant that at the time... there has yet never been any appellate determination of the substantive question in this case."
2006.06-116,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,772.422,777.031,Does it make any difference that the review was discretionary in the Ninth Circuit?
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,783.481,784.872,It would be exactly the same.
2006.06-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,817.562,821.45,Perhaps you should go on to the merits.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,821.45,821.919,Thank you.
2006.06-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.919,839.787,"And on that I have a preliminary question, because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,842.553,844.333,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do."
2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,861.325,866.119,"I have a more basic question, whether we had a case or controversy to start with."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,913.335,917.787,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, this is actually an a fortiori."
2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.265,931.608,"Oh, no."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,941.558,942.074,--Indeed.
2006.06-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.634,1030.694,"Except that she is removable by election, and that is indeed what has happened."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1046.811,1047.421,Justice Scalia--
2006.06-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.421,1052.637,So it is an intrabranch dispute that can be resolved by the electorate essentially.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1052.637,1055.042,--There may very... it may very well occur.
2006.06-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.924,1121.814,I guess I'm not quite sure what that means.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1141.118,1160.642,"It is her position that if she were presented tomorrow with a borrowing that would exceed the debt caps under the position of the attorney general in this case, she will not sign it because that constitutes her interpretation of the law."
2006.06-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.642,1163.266,So she adopts the interpretation of her predecessor?
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1163.266,1163.766,Correct.
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.766,1168.355,"I have a question, if I can, if we should reach the merits of the case--"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1168.355,1171.417,I think you should reach the merits of the case.
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.417,1171.714,--I know that.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1176.151,1176.573,Okay.
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.758,1182.226,"I know, but I have a question I'd like you to go into."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1182.226,1182.881,--Okay.
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.881,1189.348,"I looked up, my law clerk has, and found eight States that seem roughly comparable."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1228.083,1234.924,"Well, they... what's happening in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at least the rest of the balance of my time."
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.168,1293.181,"Try Utah, try Iowa."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1293.525,1313.594,"--There were three States that we discussed, Passy is one, Halsey is the other and I can't remember the name of the other one, where they used... where the State constitution just said ""aggregate valuation"" or ""the valuation"" and the State supreme court said: There's no modifier for valuation; that must mean full value."
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.071,1336.241,"Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this, just about Guam, not about the other territories."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1345.691,1346.816,--Absolutely nothing.
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1346.816,1352.189,"So there's no, no limit in the Organic Act of any real meaning?"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1352.189,1381.035,"That's... the limit in the Organic Act, and it makes it entirely consistent with all of the other territories that I... are not that many and I will explicate... which is the uniform rule has been that the basis for valuation of property against which the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is the same as the valuation of property against which the property taxes apply."
2006.06-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.558,1484.682,Please don't.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1487.368,1490.196,--But the--
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.196,1492.227,--My question is the following.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1511.312,1516.669,"--I think that would be hard to find out, and I don't know."
2006.06-116,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.538,1537.381,"Just on the merits, the first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they--"
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1537.582,1538.129,Correct.
2006.06-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1538.129,1543.144,"And they're valuing it for tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1543.144,1565.571,"I'm not... our argument is that the word ""tax valuation"" has to have meaning; and the plainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit, the most natural meaning of ""tax valuation"" is the valuation that is used by Guam for the calculation of tax."
2006.06-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1657.66,1662.704,There are big lenders in the United States and those people don't fool around.
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1696.394,1697.299,Okay.
2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.219,1707.421,"Now Mr. Waxman, we've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to the merits."
2006.06-116,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1710.607,1711.091,--Thank you.
2006.06-116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.127,1777.876,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1779.703,1785.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1827.809,1844.708,"Ms. Brinkmann, Congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the order... there's no automatic dismissal of the case when Congress passes an act."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1873.541,1875.759,"Your Honor, we respectfully disagree."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.514,1907.808,"What if, what if you have an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear whether it applies to pending cases or not?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1921.957,1931.267,"--No, Your Honor, that is the situation that the Court confronts in the three-judge district court cases within in the instances in which there was a mistake made as to where the appeal should be taken."
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.726,1968.486,"May I ask, would the Ninth Circuit have had jurisdiction after October 30, 2004 to vacate the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and send the case back?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1968.486,1968.908,--Yes.
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.952,1976.436,We did that.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1989.4,1989.822,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.273,1995.725,Isn't that subject to gamesmanship?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2005.408,2006.471,"We think not, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.393,2046.657,"Well, you'd say Santos, then, is... is... is the Rubicon?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2049.969,2058.935,"No we believe in this particular instance, particularly on, with the clarity under Brunner, of the divestiture of the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction here."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.65,2061.275,Yeah.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2066.088,2076.443,"Well, I'm suggesting in response to your question, Justice Scalia, that in those other situations where there may be a question, that does not put the Petitioner in a situation of not being able to seek review."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.443,2077.725,Which is not this case.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2077.725,2078.676,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.676,2083.672,The Ninth Circuit would have been without authority to issue the orders in Santos under your reasoning.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2094.654,2098.979,"No, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction."
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.813,2129.109,"May I ask, how much time did the Petitioners have after the statute passed?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2132.654,2133.966,90 days Your Honor.
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.013,2136.622,Why would that be so?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2136.622,2144.681,--The timely petition to the Ninth Circuit and the grant of certiorari would have suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court judgment.
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.77,2198.238,"Well, in this case if it was not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false exercise here?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2198.238,2202.954,"It was not a false exercise, Your Honor, until October 30 of 2004."
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2205.342,2216.917,"But it, it, it was still an exercise... it was an exercise in this case of the same authority that it was purporting to exercise in Santos, which you conceded."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2240.626,2242.548,"--There was jurisdiction, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2259.555,2279.829,"Once the... once the Ninth Circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing jurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the order that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't bound to litigate that here."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2306.974,2308.802,"--It can, Your Honor, but--"
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.802,2310.567,Isn't that what it was doing?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2310.567,2318.109,"--Yes, but if it is found there is no jurisdiction, then the party cannot have relied on that to suspend--"
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2318.109,2318.719,Why... why can't it?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2318.719,2323.919,"--Because this Court's cases make clear, the Wynn, Eisenberg case--"
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2323.919,2327.309,But those... those... are they... and you have got me here.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2337.759,2346.88,"--And in those cases, Your Honor, the courts also... appellate courts were undoubtedly exercising jurisdiction in those cases."
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.431,2376.743,I--
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2376.743,2378.649,That is a well established Federal jurisdiction principle.
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2378.649,2401.904,"--I guess I'm still at a loss on the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the 90-day filing period, you're saying that the Ninth Circuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another purpose, the determination of whether it had jurisdiction, you're saying it does have jurisdiction."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2404.216,2404.731,I don't believe so.
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2406.089,2408.23,I don't see how you can have it both ways.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2408.23,2418.6,"--Well this Court has made clear, for example, in the three-judge district court cases, that this Court has jurisdiction when an appeal comes before it, to decide whether or not it has jurisdiction over that appeal."
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2420.038,2423.786,Maybe I should say I don't know why this Court can have it both ways.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2431.784,2435.781,"--No, Your Honor, I think it rests in this whole idea that courts have to have jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction."
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.609,2441.482,"And then when they decide they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2443.356,2444.153,--No.
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.153,2446.48,The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction this whole time.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2455.398,2463.614,The divestiture of the jurisdiction occurred on the date that Congress's statute went into effect.
2006.06-116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2463.614,2467.612,"What if, what if the Ninth Circuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2469.268,2474.813,"Your Honor, that would have been the scenario I discussed before, the parties could have litigated that."
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2507.878,2510.658,But those cases really are not on point.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2562.464,2568.712,"Your Honor, I think that this Court addressed this scenario, and one of two things could have happened."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2669.812,2675.155,But don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2681.136,2681.636,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2685.619,2688.086,That's where I'm having trouble on your side.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2736.254,2737.488,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.488,2737.753,Because?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2737.753,2744.235,Because that property in Guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree.
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.031,2748.344,No.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2780.643,2790.826,"Well, Your Honor, as a matter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation of property in Guam, you look at the property in Guam and then you have to take the tax valuation."
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2816.066,2819.642,"Well, why why does it do any more than the 35 percent value?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2821.267,2833.106,"Because that could be changed at the whim of the legislature, Your Honor, and the legislature could change that assessment to increase the debt limit and... while lowering taxes and altering any tax liability."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2833.106,2839.745,"With respect to much of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the legislature as well."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2839.745,2849.974,"But when you're looking to a bond debt limitation, you're looking at the bond market, you're looking at investors, the certainty of an appraisal value, actual real value, and--"
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.974,2851.396,But it doesn't have to be 100 percent.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2867.389,2869.904,--We don't believe that was the intent of Congress.
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.904,2888.053,"Well, whether it was their intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the--"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2889.662,2891.739,"Yes, they certainly could do that as a matter of fact."
2006.06-116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.759,2928.334,"No, just before you go there, if I were a bond investor, I would much prefer issuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the assessed value."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2930.738,2950.823,"--Your Honor, the uncertainty, however, that the debt limitation is a real limitation that serves the purpose of Congress in order to have some kind of fiscal responsibility to the Territory is what is furthered by the real limitation of having a concrete appraisal full value as a basis for the calculations."
2006.06-116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.823,2955.103,"Well, you do have a concrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2955.103,2965.786,But that can be changed at the whim of the legislature without any accountability to the voters because at the same time that they change the tax rate and not alter any tax liability.
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2965.786,2968.082,"Well, you say without any responsibility to the voters."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2985.997,2988.964,"Because I assume the tax rate will be changed, so it's not just... there's no--"
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2988.964,2991.994,"But if the tax rate is changed, they're going to call twice."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2991.994,2992.338,--No.
2006.06-116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3008.051,3009.3,But they're going to know this.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3014.283,3022.248,"--Your Honor, of course the bond issuance here also goes to the Guam legislature and they are held accountable for that in the political arena."
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.455,3052.595,Do they tax on the basis of the--
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3052.595,3053.173,Yeah.
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.173,3056.078,"--This is a fractional, this 35 percent."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3065.433,3065.698,Yeah.
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3065.698,3067.464,--and then just have a lower tax rate?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3067.464,3067.714,Yes.
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3067.714,3070.79,And what was the appraisal practice?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3076.351,3084.614,"But here, in the Virgin Islands and Alaska, Federal law requires that the taxes be imposed on the actual value."
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.217,3098.841,Which one?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3101.512,3101.746,Yes.
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.746,3109.337,"Well, which of the ones that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a percentage of market value?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3109.337,3110.181,None.
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.181,3110.759,All right.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3111.634,3118.209,But I think it does further the purpose of what Congress was looking to in both the Virgin Islands and Alaska.
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.486,3131.579,"Well, we could look at Hawaii."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3139.044,3139.856,But the actual--
2006.06-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.856,3142.48,And in the District of Columbia... where are we on this?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3146.275,3157.349,"--The preexisting law in Hawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on the actual value, and subsequent to the debt limitation, the territorial law also put it on actual value."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3171.048,3177.998,"But doesn't it... who is this provision designed to protect, just the Guamanian taxpayers or Federal taxpayers more generally?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3177.998,3180.152,"It's the Guamanians, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3181.261,3184.916,"If the Guamanian government runs a deficit, where is the difference made up from?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3184.916,3200.223,"--Most of the income and revenue on Guam comes from the Federal income tax, because unlike on the mainland, the Federal income tax goes to the Guam Treasury rather than the United States Treasury."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.223,3203.861,I know that any taxes from Guam are returned to Guam.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3208.532,3213.608,"Yeah, other financial relationships with the U.S. Government, yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3213.608,3220.98,"So that if the Guamanian Treasury runs into difficulty, it's made up not just by Guamanian taxpayers, but by all Federal taxpayers?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3220.98,3221.338,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.707,3246.829,"I cannot imagine that if a territory of the United States goes belly up, that the United States is not going to foot the bill."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3248.297,3255.358,"Your Honor, we believe here that the debt limitation is a matter of local concern."
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.135,3313.629,"Miss Brinkmann, just to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, is there any history of the Federal government having to bail out the Guam government for bankruptcy or anything close to that?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3313.629,3314.114,"No, Your Honor, none whatsoever."
2006.06-116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.114,3318.02,And is there anything in the record that tells us what kind of a credit rating Guam has?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3318.02,3319.768,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe it does."
2006.06-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3319.768,3335.184,"Did this value issue... I mean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy between, the attorney general refused to sign, did that have any consequences for whether this bond issue went through?"
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3335.184,3336.371,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3382.151,3390.539,"In that case, you should want us to exercise jurisdiction, decide it one way or the other."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3390.539,3402.768,"Your Honor, we believe that it should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the Guam Supreme Court opinion stands, and we prevail under that ruling, the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 11 of the Organic Act."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.768,3408.186,Could you tell me whether the rate of tax is uniform throughout Guam?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3418.059,3419.776,"It is an island-wide tax, Your Honor."
2006.06-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3424.431,3433.193,I don't know why you just didn't raise your assessed value from 30 percent to 100 percent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3433.193,3441.127,We don't believe that Congress intended to inject itself into the workings of this local territorial tax mechanism.
2006.06-116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.909,3448.906,"But you still have the option, and I'm just dying to ask the question not having anything to do with the case."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3459.948,3466.102,--That is exactly the kind of policy decision that the local governing authority makes about taxes.
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3522.157,3525.437,"Yeah, but you talked about this as the deference we owe to the Guam Supreme Court."
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3529.419,3538.087,"--Yes, Your Honor, and in the Santa Fe case versus Friday, with all due respect, Petitioner is incorrect that that addressed territorial laws."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.834,3585.381,Does that apply to all the provisions of the Organic Act?
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3593.972,3596.315,"--Your Honor, I see my time is up, but if you'd like me to respond?"
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3596.315,3596.924,That's fine.
2006.06-116,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3596.924,3607.138,"I think that you could look to your area of administrative deference, for example, under Chevron, where you do also defer to the authority of an agency, the interpretation of an agency."
2006.06-116,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3613.338,3614.292,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
2006.06-116,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3617.697,3619.477,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-116,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3803.043,3804.137,"Thank you, counsel."
