1996.95-1621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.587,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1621, Harbor Tug & Barge Company v. John Papai."
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,22.425,25.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1621,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.674,100.047,"Mr. Danoff, as a preliminary question, if the Court were to address the second question and conclude that we do not look at the prior relationship with other tug owner employers but confine the fleet principle to the same owner of the vessels being worked on, if we were to do that, do we have to reach the first question, or would that become advisory?"
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,105.65,114.566,The case could be decided on either one of the two questions in our favor and that could end the case.
1996.95-1621,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.566,116.239,And should it end the case?
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,120.47,128.668,"I think in this case yes, and the reason is that there is a significant and clear split in the circuits on both issues."
1996.95-1621,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.668,134.634,"Well, there's a split on both, but answering both might make something advisory, it seems to me."
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,134.634,152.613,"I think it would not be... if the decision were made on both issues, as I think it should be, it would eliminate the problems we have raised in the brief with duplicative litigation in the case of each issue, and it would resolve the split in the circuits in each issue."
1996.95-1621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.198,159.261,Which of the two is the more important issue--
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,159.261,160.283,I--
1996.95-1621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.283,162.843,--to those who are in the field?
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,162.843,165.387,"--Well, it's actually somewhat different fields."
1996.95-1621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.404,272.75,"Mr. Danoff, would you explain to me... I know you have a literal interpretation of 905(a), but standing back from that, you mentioned the Gizoni case."
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,313.608,319.312,"--Well, the employer would not always get protection if it voluntarily paid, that's true."
1996.95-1621,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.34,354.185,"Yes, but you know, the big problem as I see it here is that provision in title 33 section 903(e)."
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,357.748,358.56,"--Yes, it is."
1996.95-1621,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.56,388.059,"And it says, notwithstanding any other provision of law any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed under this chapter, the longshoreman workers case, pursuant to the Jones Act, seaman act case, shall be credited against any liability imposed by this chapter."
1996.95-1621,0,22167,eric_danoff,,410.472,413.485,The section to which you refer--
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1836.746,1842.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.978,1918.78,That's simply a denial of summary judgment.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1922.333,1932.691,"Well, Your Honor, the district judge determined that because of the circumstance of this man's employment he could proceed with a 905(b) action."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.691,1937.594,"What order did the district court enter, denial of a motion for summary judgment?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1937.594,1942.567,A partial... a partial denial of the motion for summary judgment.
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.567,1943.307,On the 905(b)?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1943.307,1943.647,Right.
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.647,1946.759,That simply means there's enough evidence to go to trial.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1953.595,1953.785,No.
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.233,1976.674,Excuse me.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1992.526,1994.028,You mean arguably a longshoreman.
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.028,1995.567,Arguably a longshoreman and arguably has--
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,1995.567,1998.031,"Well, I think the court... the case is dismissable."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.391,2021.976,"--He arguably had a 905... it didn't say he had a 905(b), that he arguably did, which means he's arguably a longshoreman."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2021.976,2032.241,"--Your Honor, there is no determination by the finder of fact that a 905(b) action as to whether or not the worker is a longshoreman is given that he is a longshoreman."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.315,2037.016,Is that right?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2037.016,2037.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.577,2038.187,"What do you mean, it's given?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2039.269,2051.165,"Well, it's just like... it's in the nature of in a diversity action you allege that you're a citizen of State A, and you allege defendant is a citizen of State B."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.165,2052.958,And that can't be controverted?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2052.958,2056.05,"Yes, it can, and the defendant did controvert it in this case."
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2056.659,2058.203,"Mr. Boyle, I'm not following your argument--"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2068.58,2069.369,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2069.369,2079.967,"And then said, because you're not a sailor, and that's... although it was interlocutory that was out of the case, and then they went over to the 905(b) case."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2079.967,2088.355,And as part of the 905(b) case went to the ALJ at the Department of Labor to get the lien established.
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.993,2104.905,Then how do we get the adjudication of benefits by the ALJ?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2104.905,2122.727,"Because the ALJ didn't recognize that he was already precluded from making another determination about status by virtue of the district judge's decision and undertook to make a new determination, and then made a new determination, which he should not have made."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.727,2123.388,I don't follow--
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2150.616,2151.728,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.319,2171.063,"Can I ask about the main collateral estoppel issue, something that's bothering me that I don't see answered."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2190.767,2191.188,Yes.
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.188,2191.758,Okay.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2219.636,2219.976,Well--
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.976,2226.069,"Because the court says he's a longshoreman and the ALJ said he's a seaman, and there he is, not a penny."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2238.441,2266.839,"--Well, the way it works out is that if the employer went before... in front of the ALJ and vigorously argued that the worker was a seaman, regardless of what the ALJ decided, the arguments, the conduct advanced by that litigant in front of the ALJ, principles of equitable estoppel would prevent the employer from going in front of the district judge and taking an opposite position."
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.839,2269.91,"Well then, why wouldn't it equally bind the employee?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2269.91,2278.826,"Well, because in this case and in all of these cases you never have an employee go in and vigorously argue that they're a longshoreman."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.826,2283.421,Will we measure the vigor of the argument in determining collateral estoppel?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2283.421,2298.181,"Well, to the extent that one of the guidelines of the Astoria Savings case versus Solimino is the incentive to vigorously or aggressively pursue a position."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.115,2334.536,"Excuse me, I don't understand that."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2334.536,2390.254,"Well, in this Court's opinion in Gizoni, on 502 U.S. page 91, the Court stated that one of the reasons why receipt of longshore benefits should not preclude pursuit of Jones Act benefits was that section 903(e) of the Longshore Act says that any payments by reason... payments made under the Jones Act would be a credit to any liability imposed upon the employer under the Longshore Act, and in a footnote in that opinion it was mentioned that because of that there is no detrimental reliance upon any position that the employee takes because the employer gets credit for having paid moneys out under the Jones Act."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.039,2442.547,"Of course, that could just... what your opponent says here is that that could just handle the situation in which there has been a Jones Act determination without collateral estoppel effect, or the situation in which Jones Act damages are partly different but not entirely different from harbor worker damages."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2442.547,2458.419,"--It could, but what we're trying to determine here is whether Congress, when it enacted the various iterations of the Longshore Act, meant for an ALJ award to be preclusive or not."
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.211,2468.807,"Your view is it's preclusive if the employer wins, but it's not preclusive if the employee wins?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2468.807,2469.048,--No.
1996.95-1621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.159,2474.794,"So then how are we going to deal with this worker, if it's not preclusive in either case?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2503.892,2508.464,"Well, longshore benefits are paid voluntarily by employers."
1996.95-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.801,2552.052,"But isn't it also true, just to throw this in, there are situations in which the plaintiff will recover under neither scheme, because if he is in fact a seaman he can't recover as a longshoreman, and he may not be able to prove negligence, in which event he won't recover under the Jones Act either."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2552.052,2556.937,"That's right, and that's the choice the litigant takes."
1996.95-1621,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2556.937,2560.23,"Well, if he's neither, maybe he's entitled to State Worker's Comp."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2560.23,2570.397,"Definitely not, because he's injured on board a vessel, and the situs of his injury would not entitle him to State Comp under any circumstances."
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.658,2573.97,Just one point.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2580.284,2580.764,--Nothing.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.764,2581.555,Or maintenance in cure?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2581.555,2583.306,Maintenance in cure has nothing to do with unseaworthy.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2584.148,2585.37,But he does get that--
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2585.37,2585.67,--Yes.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.67,2586.772,--as a seaman.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2586.772,2589.975,"Yes, as long as he's temporarily disabled."
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.578,2594.95,That's $22 a week?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2596.981,2599.832,"It has nothing to do with... no, it isn't, it's $22 a day in this--"
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2599.832,2602.724,"And why is it it has nothing to do with it, because--"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2602.724,2605.256,--Because that... it has... that's a tort remedy.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.59,2617.624,"--In other words, that's comprised within the Jones Act claim of no negligence?"
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2617.624,2618.224,Yes.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2622.517,2623.318,That's why I'm asking.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2633.586,2633.817,"Oh, yes, you do."
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2633.817,2635.306,--and you say it has nothing to do with it.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2635.306,2635.677,"Oh, no."
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2639.25,2639.711,All right.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2639.711,2641.464,Just under a lesser standard.
1996.95-1621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2641.464,2644.913,But that doesn't mean that he gets nothing then because he has a cause of action for unseaworthiness.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2644.913,2652.528,"Unless he... if he can't prove negligence, the chances are that he... it's somewhat unlikely."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.08,2674.665,"Well, if he can't prove either unseaworthiness or negligence, perhaps he doesn't deserve to get anything."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2674.665,2676.085,I think that's correct.
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2677.837,2687.394,But that's nothing to do with... the longshore... Worker's Compensation is a no fault... unseaworthiness is still a form of liability.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2693.069,2693.589,Absolutely.
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2693.589,2704.716,So... but the usual tradeoff isn't to show... the employer pays Worker's Compensation and then is not at risk in a tort suit.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2704.716,2705.057,That's correct.
1996.95-1621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2705.057,2706.939,And yet you're saying that's not what works here.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2725.282,2727.325,"Well, that's true in Gizoni anyway."
1996.95-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.427,2743.901,And you said there are five reasons why he cannot.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2743.901,2744.389,Yes.
1996.95-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.389,2745.08,And you've told us one of them.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2746.512,2768.797,"The second one is that under 913(d) of the Longshore Act the statute of limitations for filing a claim under the Jones Act is tolled while the employee pursues the Jones Act, and until such time as he's found to be not a seaman by the court, then he's relegated to the Longshore Act."
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.525,2798.708,Can it be modified with respect to the determination of longshoreman status?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2798.708,2799.619,--I believe so.
1996.95-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.952,2804.714,What makes you believe so if it's never happened?
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2804.714,2814.868,"Because the language of the statute says any aspect of any order entered by the deputy commissioner can be modified up to 1 year, and that means any."
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.034,2864.212,"But that wouldn't be entirely out of accord with the whole purpose of these schemes, not just the Longshore Act but also State Workman's Compensation schemes."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2877.913,2878.163,Well--
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.163,2879.004,--That's how those schemes are set up.
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2879.815,2880.426,--This isn't--
1996.95-1621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.426,2888.711,"You get it fast, you get it for sure, and in exchange for that you're giving up a shot at tort remedies that might get you a lot more bucks."
1996.95-1621,1,42391,thomas_j_boyle,,2900.608,2917.211,"--Well, the problem with that is that back in 1920 there were no Worker's Compensation laws, and back in 1927, in 1920 when the Jones Act was enacted, it was designed to give itinerant seamen a cause of action to be tried by a jury against their employer."
