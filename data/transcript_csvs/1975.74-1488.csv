1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.27,"We will hear arguments next in 74-1488, Secretary of Interior against New Mexico."
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,32.015,35.453,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.498,165.371,You all have wild burros on them?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,165.371,180.484,"However, the forest service only has about 5% of all the wild burros comprised on these two areas of land, 95% is controlled of the burros and wild horses are on BLM land."
1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,180.484,183.28,"BLM Land, Bureau --"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,183.28,185.113,"BLM, yes."
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.407,190.282,"Well, how about the private land?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,190.282,197.188,"There is nothing in the record that indicates, as far as I am aware, of how many burros are on private land or how many horses."
1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.241,204.782,Can you shoot them in private land?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,204.782,205.236,Sorry.
1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,205.236,207.581,Can you shoot them on private land?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,207.581,212.375,I suppose if they are your burro and they are your horse.
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.375,215.403,"He is asking if the law covers private land, and it does?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,215.403,226.698,"It does for a wild horse or wild burro, which is defined as an unclaimed or unbranded wild horse or burro on public land."
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.236,283.184,"Well, what is its practical effect, if a private land owner sees a wild burro on his land who has been, in his opinion, damaging his own crops and his own stock and depriving his own stock of food and all these other things that are alleged in the amicus brief, and just decides to pick-up his rifle and shoot him and there is no proof that that burro has ever been on public land?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,283.184,286.339,(Inaudible) Federal criminal.
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.339,293.522,"But on the other hand if it can be proved that burro had ever set foot on public land, then what?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,293.522,300.305,"Well, the Act provides that it deals with the wild horses and burros that are an integral part of the federal public land."
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.735,305.567,"These are not flora, these are fauna?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,305.567,307.288,I do not -- I realize that.
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.028,383.753,Did they support for the statement that they interfere with the lessee's property on public land?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,383.753,395.963,"Well, there is an allegation in the complaint that they damage -- they do not damage the public land, therefore --"
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.963,398.927,How about my question?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,398.927,401.892,"The lessee's property, the lessee of public land I would suppose."
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.892,402.871,Yes.
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,409.707,415.862,"Well, as far as this case is concerned, maybe I will give a factual statement."
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.862,424.616,"Let us just say that wherever you are grazing cattle on the public land, you carry salt under the land."
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,437.548,447.26,"There is evidence that these burros were eating protein blocks, but let me say that that is not Mr. Justice White a usual practice for all the grazing -- within Taylor Grazing Act."
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.173,578.999,I did not say anything about interfere with the cows.
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,582.635,584.659,They were interfering with property and the cows are the ranchâ€™s property.
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.659,586.921,And as evidence that they were in this record?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,586.921,589.863,They were eating protein blocks.
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.863,592.369,"The usual or not, they were eating up his protein blocks?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,592.369,594.699,That was it; they were eating his protein blocks.
1975.74-1488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.847,615.323,"(Inaudible) from the cattle as molesting them, is it not?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,615.323,618.387,I would not characterize that as molesting.
1975.74-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.716,635.145,"If evidence of eating the protein blocks came in without objection, presumably the complaint is deemed amended, is it not?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,635.145,638.073,I do not question the relevance of that.
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.659,655.24,Were they found on private property?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,655.24,656.943,"In this case, they were found on public property."
1975.74-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.943,661.237,"And apparently, you would think it would make no difference because they were found on private property or not."
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,661.237,664.606,Constitutionality of one provision of this act which is not a question.
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.28,711.223,Is there any allegation that he first asked the Federal authorities to please remove these?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,711.223,716.311,There was an allegation; the testimony is as follows on that question.
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.151,758.847,"Under the law, the private landowner could have requested or if the private landowner had requested the Federal authorities to remove the burros, it was incumbent upon the Federal authorities to do so, was it not?"
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,758.847,760.902,That is right.
1975.74-1488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,767.865,769.475,Permitee under the Taylor Act?
1975.74-1488,0,38517,randolph,,769.475,776.088,"Yes, he is permitee under the Taylor Act, having a six-month grazing permit using this area for 40 head of cattle for winter pasture."
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2099.234,2103.692,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.758,2200.107,(Inaudible) this land I suppose would be Taylor Grazing land?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2200.107,2200.839,That is correct.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.4,2203.417,A common way of referring to your ranch?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2203.417,2204.543,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.293,2210.872,"The state found on your ranch, you do not know whether it was found on the Taylor Grazing land or (Inaudible)?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2210.872,2220.035,"That is correct, except that, this record also contains the testimony of Kelley Stephenson about these burros in general from which I think you might well --"
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.035,2225.994,"(Inaudible) all it says whether they -- when the first found them, they were -- did he ever find them on his fee land?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2225.994,2231.863,"No, I think he did not testify and nor is there any evidence in the record as to these particular burros that, that was true."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.401,2240.175,(Voice Overlap) those burros he never knew (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2240.175,2240.956,"No sir, he did --"
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.956,2243.7,-- whatsoever that these burros were ever found on his fee land?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2243.7,2245.547,"We will admit that Your Honor, that is absolutely correct."
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.547,2252.114,"Then, the District Court is wrong in that sense that Justice Stevens quoted to Mr. Randolph?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2252.114,2253.611,"I think not, Your Honor."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.283,2375.005,You do not suggest that this case raises that issue?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2375.005,2376.292,"Yes I do, Your Honor."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.292,2377.258,Why is that?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2377.258,2387.118,"Well, I do it because this whole controversy arose out of more than just these 19 donkeys."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.118,2397.894,What the issue -- what the complaint was about was that this arose out of the fact that these 19 burros were taken from public land and sold?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2397.894,2399.769,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1975.74-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.569,2454.03,"Just so I have it in mind, you brought a Three-Judge Court complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the whole statute is unconstitutional?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2454.03,2454.487,That is correct.
1975.74-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.487,2462.324,"The question about the 16 animals and all the rest, really goes to your standing to attack the entire statute just rather than, you are not appealing a condemnation or anything like that?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2462.324,2463.071,No sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2495.278,2509.545,(Inaudible) on that first paragraph you referred us to page 66 that the state has ownership of these animals and whether they are on Federal Land or on private land or on state land --
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2509.545,2510.156,"Indeed, Your Honor."
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2510.156,2512.435,-- the Federal Government has no power regulation?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2512.435,2519.228,That is indeed our contention and has been throughout and was the in effect the holding of the Three-Judge Federal Court in New Mexico.
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.228,2542.884,"Mr. Harris, if you will turn to your complaint, the appendix at page 7 where you have paragraphs six, seven, eight all refer to what happened to Kelley Stephenson on or about the 20th day of January 1974, on these particular burros."
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2542.884,2545.809,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.809,2561.885,"I would think that you really do not have the standing to challenge the whole sweep of the Act unless you can point a factual situation such as this where there has been an actual conflict, and where someone has actually been harmed?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2561.885,2578.313,"Well, of course, I think the record does disclose an actual conflict between the State Government and the Federal Government in this area, including the letter I just made reference to Mr. Garners, as to who has the jurisdiction and the right to regulate and control these wild animals."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.329,2617.657,"But, does not the United States say that whoever owns the burros, in one of their answers anyway, is whoever owns the burros, the United States can certainly keep people from taking the burros from the public property?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2617.657,2619.827,The United States contends that and we deny that --
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.827,2621.036,I know you deny it.
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2621.036,2622.319,"Yes sir, they do contend that."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.319,2630.367,"But if we agree with the United States on that issue, would we need to go any further?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2642.257,2643.098,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.098,2644.9,"Now, is that -- would the case be over then?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2644.9,2645.209,No sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.09,2647.784,Why not?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2647.784,2657.492,"Well, because I think you must, well of course, perhaps it would be what you must look at to determine that question is whether or not, there was a constitutional authority."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.492,2664.232,"In fact, they well -- that maybe so, but the Act also covers burros on private land?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2664.232,2665.692,"Yes sir, it extends to private land."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.692,2667.265,And you want that adjudicated too?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2667.265,2668.463,"We do, Your Honor."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.409,2671.396,"As Justice Stevens says, it is in the case?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2671.396,2671.687,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.687,2673.9,Or suggested or asked --
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2673.9,2674.719,Let me point up --
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.719,2677.579,"Before you leave that Mr. Harris, let me ask you one more question."
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2704.332,2705.075,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.914,2763.416,You can certainly get an adjudication on what law governs that factual situation.
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2778.264,2778.956,I am sorry.
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.111,2797.148,"For instance, the taking of burros on private land or either claimed by the United States Government that it may regulate who may take and who may not take burros from concededly fee land, not lease land, not public land, but fee land."
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2797.148,2797.88,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.88,2802.144,That really is not raised by what happened to Kelley Stephenson?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2802.144,2827.465,"Well, we think that it is in the sense that the Three-Judge Federal Court had before it evidence from which and I mentioned this a moment ago, I think they could reasonably have inferred that these animals were at one time on his fee land and may have gotten over on the public domain at the time they were noticed, at the time they were picked up, that is where they were."
1975.74-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.503,2923.404,But the government did not have to rely on that regulation?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2923.404,2924.161,That is correct.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.082,2939.603,"I suppose your premise as I understood it that the state owned fee land, the state is the owner of these animals?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2939.603,2940.183,That is true.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2940.86,2949.647,"And your premise is that, that being true, the Federal Government has absolutely no power whatsoever under the Commerce Clause or the Property Clause --"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2949.647,2950.116,True.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2950.116,2954.062,-- to enact this statute as applied to animals owned by the state?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2954.062,2954.981,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2954.981,2964.379,"And it would not matter whether the issue that was there and factually it is true here that they were on private land, the public land or only on one or the other --"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2964.379,2964.83,That is true.
1975.74-1488,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2964.83,2967.703,-- if that is true then you win the case?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2967.703,2968.732,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2976.203,2977.092,Mr. Harris.
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,2977.092,2977.304,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2977.304,3005.785,"In that connection, let us assume for the moment that the government fenced in say 10,000 acres of its own land with fences so high that the burros could not leap it or get out of it, would the state have authority in your view that the state owns these burros to compel the government to take the fence down out or at least allow the burros to leave?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3005.785,3007.636,"Indeed, that is our position."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.666,3021.732,As you -- you have same answer -- do you have the same answer for deer?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3021.732,3022.769,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.769,3026.293,"Do you think that, that really means that the state owns them whether they are owners (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3026.293,3026.962,To the extent that --
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.962,3028.537,-- or that they are not owned by anybody?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3028.537,3032.228,"To the extent that anyone can own game, the state does."
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.955,3041.374,Do you mean something more and that the state has power to regulate the hunting or killing of them?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3042.178,3042.973,I mean --
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.973,3047.327,I take it that you mean to actually own the animals themselves?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3047.327,3052.544,They exercise all of the rights of ownership that we know of.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.544,3061.337,Your authority for the fact that the state owns the animals rather than just having the power to regulate the taking of them?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3061.337,3062.54,Geer was not the first case.
1975.74-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.726,3069.244,The wild animals -- that these are wild animals --
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3069.244,3070.017,The deer -- that is here.
1975.74-1488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3081.679,3084.286,Toomer against Witsell said that was a legal fiction?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3084.286,3101.939,"Yes, but they said this about it and I am glad you brought it up because they say it is a legal fiction expressive in a legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a state have the power to preserve and regulate the exportation of an important resource."
1975.74-1488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3101.939,3105.156,"A parent's patriarch is a legal fiction too, is it not?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3105.156,3106.065,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.065,3112.956,"And this is really an ownership of like the parent's patriarch, it is ownership for the benefit of all the people?"
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3112.956,3116.57,"Yes sir, but it is the people of the state in accordance with the decision in Geer --"
1975.74-1488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3116.57,3118.028,In the states?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3118.028,3123.136,And Lacoste which came along later and in Toomer?
1975.74-1488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.136,3129.149,You say that the State Mexico could take these donkeys over to the Federal Property and kill them?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3129.149,3146.599,"Yes sir, because I think the Act is unconstitutional and void as violative of the Tenth Amendment in that, there is no power given to the Congress by our constitution either under the Property Clause or the Commerce Clause to regulate animals which we own."
1975.74-1488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3146.599,3155.058,You have a right to go into this manâ€™s private property and take his deer and shoot?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3155.058,3155.392,The state?
1975.74-1488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.392,3156.135,The State of Mexico?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3156.135,3157.184,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.467,3160.485,Just go in and kill all that?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3160.485,3163.469,"Yes sir, on wild animals."
1975.74-1488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3163.469,3165.394,How about on a national park?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3165.394,3170.661,That is an incompletely different category because there you dealing with the different categorization of Federal Land.
1975.74-1488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3176.872,3178.6,That is read differently for that kind of land?
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3178.6,3179.669,Yes sir.
1975.74-1488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.148,3194.654,(Voice Overlap) so that is ---
1975.74-1488,1,25521,george_t_harris_jr,,3194.654,3206.129,"The Migratory Game Act, if I can address that for just a moment, involves or did involve basically the same argument that we got here with our donkey case."
1975.74-1488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.273,3610.113,Thank you Mr. Harris.
