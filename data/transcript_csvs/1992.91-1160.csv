1992.91-1160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1160, A.J. Arave v. Thomas E. Creech."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,32.601,35.071,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,99.664,109.103,"At the outset is it, is the vagueness issue the only question in the case?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,109.103,112.988,"Well, no, Your Honor, I don't think the vagueness issue is the only issue in the case."
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.625,124.827,We didn't limit the grant of certiorari?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,124.827,133.331,"Yes, Your Honor, the certiorari grant was limited to the vagueness question, the utter disregard question."
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,133.331,136.533,Then it is the only issue in the case.
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,136.533,137.568,"It is... yes, it is."
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,139.67,141.27,That you're going to argue.
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,141.27,142.103,--That's correct.
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.103,145.721,"All right, thank you."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,145.721,166.651,"The utter disregard or cold-bloodedness finding in this case is supported by a considerable background of murderous behavior by the defendant, and by the fact that in this case he killed another inmate in the state maximum security institution."
1992.91-1160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,166.651,169.586,"General Thomas, before you get into your argument can I just get one thing clear?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,182.811,202.539,"Well, no, Your Honor, I don't necessarily concede that it would be facially vague, but we did, when this case went to the Idaho Supreme Court for the first time, suggest that the court impose on it a limiting construction as to make sure that there was no doubt that the factor was to be applied in the narrowest kinds of circumstances."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,222.186,225.638,Does this language come out of the model penal code?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,225.638,240.148,"No, as far as I know, Your Honor, the precise language is not duplicated in any of the other statutes and it, to the best of my recollection, was not a model penal code suggestion."
1992.91-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.148,256.572,"The trier of fact in assessing this particular standard, the utter disregard for human life with the Osborn gloss on it, did not take into account the fact that he had killed previously."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,259.692,261.976,"That I believe is incorrect, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.917,278.171,But did that bear on the fact that he was cold-blooded and pitiless?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,278.171,279.023,--I think it did.
1992.91-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.738,322.6,"Well, I had thought that the statute focused on, and this particular part of the statute, the pitiless killer, really focused more on the killer's conduct with respect to the slaying in question, in which case the previous killings would be irrelevant."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,322.6,336.442,"I think the statute focuses on anything that reflects a cold-blooded or particularly callous state of mind, and that can refer to a pattern of murderous behavior."
1992.91-1160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,343.113,355.856,"Mr. Thomas, will you give us some examples of first degree murders in Idaho that are not cold-blooded or pitiless?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,355.856,376.186,"Well, I think that almost any murder, Your Honor, would be, would qualify as not cold-blooded or pitiless if there were any kind of emotional provocation that went with it, any kind of distress, any kind of justification or excuse that didn't rise to the level of a legal defense."
1992.91-1160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.481,403.004,"But your description seems to describe this case, because isn't this the one in which the victim provoked the fight?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,405.455,420.631,"There is language in connection with the court's mitigation considerations, Your Honor, that suggests that what the court found was that the defendant initially, I'm sorry, the victim initially provoked the attack."
1992.91-1160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.641,437.541,Let me just ask you this question.
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,446.246,459.006,"--I believe it would, Your Honor, although I would acknowledge that there are ambiguities in the trial court's description of the case and it is not as complete as we would have liked to see it."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,470.195,483.287,"Mr. Thomas, may I just go back to your answer to Justice Stevens' last question, because I'm not sure why it would, why this particular sentence would be consistent with your criterion."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,505.585,506.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,525.614,535.636,"With respect, though, I think Justice Stevens' question was if we take the trial judge's finding on its face is this particular sentence consistent with your criterion."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,535.636,537.02,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.8,577.528,"But the criterion is whether, as I understand it, is whether by the murder, which I assume, as Justice Kennedy was suggesting a moment ago, it means this murder or circumstances surrounding its commission, the defendant exhibits utter disregard."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,594.056,611.518,"--Well, let me in response to your question, if I may, focus on one aspect of what does appear in the trial court's finding, and that is that after the victim was helpless and after he had been completely dominated by Creech, Creech killed him at that point."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.11,633.812,And I can see that as a perfectly relevant consideration except for one thing.
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,665.116,672.187,--I don't think that that necessarily accurately characterizes what the trial judge found here.
1992.91-1160,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,722.369,726.654,"Mr. Thomas, the victim had a handicap, didn't he?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,726.654,727.404,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,727.404,728.439,What was that handicap?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,728.439,736.259,He had at some time prior to his imprisonment shot himself in the head with a 38 caliber revolver.
1992.91-1160,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,763.41,782.907,"Didn't the trial judge or the sentencing judge also find that even though the victim provoked the altercation, he went on to find that with the victim's attack as an excuse the defendant's murder then took on the many, took on many aspects of an assassination?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,782.907,796.631,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I thin that is one of the really important factors that indicates the cold-bloodedness or the focus on cold-bloodedness that the trial court engaged in in its consideration of the case."
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.253,953.933,"Do you think the issue in the case is whether or not this aggravating factor, as described or narrowed by the Idaho Supreme Court, could be applied in any case, or is the claim that it could not be applied to any case?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,966.759,984.054,"--Yes, I believe that is what the court of appeals said with this proviso, they said that the factor itself was not invalid, it was just that the Idaho Supreme Court's limiting construction hadn't provided any more guidance than the language of the statute."
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.054,990.208,"Well, all right, but and so the conclusion was it couldn't be used as an aggravating factor in any case?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,990.208,993.827,"Yes, as limited, that's correct."
1992.91-1160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.827,1001.747,Did the court of appeals make any effort to see if it could be applied to this particular case?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1001.747,1026.798,"They appeared not to have done so or not to have done so in a very significant fashion, Your Honor, because the court simply said, like the heinousness factor in Godfrey and Maynard or similar factors, the limiting instruction doesn't mean anything different than the statute, and they did not appear to make any--"
1992.91-1160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.798,1034.135,"It was so vague, it was so vague that there is no case that it could be applied to?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1034.135,1037.319,"--That's the way I read the decision, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.319,1049.212,"You didn't, the state didn't take the position, I take it in the court of appeals, that in fact as applied by a judge rather than a jury it was not constitutionally vague at all?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1049.212,1058.317,"We did take the position, as I recall, and I'm not, I don't recall specifically how we set this up."
1992.91-1160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1135.568,1150.327,"Of course that's the very issue that you've just stated, and I still have a little trouble in finding murders that are not pitiless and cold-blooded in Idaho, first degree murders."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1150.327,1152.827,"That's a valid point, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1160.183,1161.649,All first degree murders.
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1161.649,1169.636,"--I'm sorry, all first... you may even say that about all murders, second degree murders at least."
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.367,1218.152,"Mr. Thomas, could I come back to the factual findings again?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1234.161,1235.447,That's exactly--
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.447,1237.847,"They're one and the same, same time found both of those things?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1237.847,1241.232,--Yes.
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.232,1252.557,What was the authority of the supreme court when confronted with those what I consider utterly incompatible findings?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1256.194,1257.477,It could indeed.
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.655,1287.88,"And there was some evidence that although the victim was the attacker, the attack had been in effect invited by the defendant?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1287.88,1288.582,--Yes.
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.582,1296.902,"Had provided the attacker with the means of the attack, and so forth, intending to use that as an excuse."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1296.902,1297.771,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.771,1301.556,And presumably that's the finding that the supreme court made?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1301.556,1305.941,That's our view.
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1370.331,1385.959,"Mr. Thomas, I don't see how this is relevant to the utter disregard criteria because it is written in this way, by the murder or circumstances surrounding its commission the defendant exhibits utter disregard."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1395.915,1401.319,"Well, I think the principal relevant factor from the other crimes is that Creech, just as he did--"
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1401.319,1404.004,"No, but why are other crimes relevant at all?"
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1418.347,1422.632,"--I see your point, Your Honor, and I think we are reading it the same way, but I don't--"
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.632,1426.418,Then why should we consider the circumstances of other crimes?
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1426.418,1439.178,"--Well, irrespective of the nature of the aggravating factor itself, the court is obliged to consider all of the aspects that are there about the defendant's character and his background and his criminal behavior."
1992.91-1160,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.344,1447.699,"But not for purposes of applying this particular section for independent, in order to discharge independent responsibilities, that's what you're saying."
1992.91-1160,0,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,1447.699,1448.316,--That's true enough.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1583.235,1585.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.072,1653.415,"You say, Mr. Gardner, that the question in this case is whether that, the judicial gloss placed on the Idaho statute by the Idaho Supreme Court was constitutional as applied to this particular defendant?"
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1653.415,1657.2,"Well, the Ninth Circuit I think reached two decisions, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.271,1664.587,In any case.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1664.587,1665.823,--In any case.
1992.91-1160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.114,1679.481,So it made two separate holdings in--
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1679.481,1684.368,I believe that's an accurate characterization of the appellate court's opinion.
1992.91-1160,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1684.368,1696.408,"--Do we know that on remand the Idaho Supreme Court is going to rest the sentence on this factor, on the particular aggravating factor, circumstance in question here?"
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1696.408,1704.514,"Well, Your Honor, because of the nature of the remand it's actually going back for a full resentencing hearing because there was a failure to allow any evidence in mitigation."
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.466,1709.066,I see.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1711.118,1712.002,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.002,1713.104,Just to the vagueness.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1713.104,1714.187,Just to the vagueness question.
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.187,1716.239,Just to the first holding that you described.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1716.239,1717.339,I believe that's right.
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.476,1723.876,Not the second holding that you described.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1723.876,1726.278,--I don't believe that is at issue in light of the remand.
1992.91-1160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.278,1736.235,"So the particulars of this particular defendant, the evidence against this particular defendant are not really before us?"
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1747.025,1775.96,"Well, I think necessarily, Your Honor, in the context of this case in defending the Ninth Circuit's decision on the vagueness issue, and perhaps my response to Your Honor's question was somewhat too quick, is that the Ninth Circuit decision can be defended on, I believe on either ground, the decision on the vagueness issue which is that the utter disregard factor as formulated by Osborn is vague, and its decision that if it's not vague, if it does mean without emotion, as the state has contended--"
1992.91-1160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1775.96,1793.489,"But if there's going to be a resentencing here in any event, at least the most important element that we could decide, I suppose, is whether or not the judicial gloss, et cetera, is or is not constitutional on its face."
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1793.489,1794.589,--I think that is absolutely right.
1992.91-1160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.762,1805.964,That's the issue we limited our grant to.
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1805.964,1807.499,"--Well, Your Honor is correct."
1992.91-1160,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.833,1845.707,Are there any statutory aggravating factors other than utter disregard that could be the basis for imposing the death sentence here?
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1845.707,1853.98,"Certainly the trial court found a number of statutory aggravating circumstances true, under the Idaho scheme any one of which is enough."
1992.91-1160,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.557,1897.524,May I interrupt you just a second?
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1904.928,1906.88,"--No, Your Honor, I don't."
1992.91-1160,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1906.88,1910.082,"Okay, so this is within the terminology that you're using."
1992.91-1160,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1913.034,1914.8,Utter disregard is a subjective factor.
1992.91-1160,2,35201,lynn_e_thomas,,2752.55,2753.75,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.352,2759.385,"Thank you, Mr. Thomas."
