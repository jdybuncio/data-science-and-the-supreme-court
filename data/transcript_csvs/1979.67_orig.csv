1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,26.346,29.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.705,322.825,I missed number two; you gave us number --
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,322.825,330.29,"Yes, Your Honor, the second finding of the Court was the pendency of the U.S. v. Oregon and Sohappy v. Smith's judgments."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.29,332.453,They were no bar to this action.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,332.453,332.95,"Pardon me, sir."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.95,334.353,But they were no bar to this action.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,334.353,335.814,"They were no bar to the action; yes, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,335.814,338.073,Okay.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,338.073,346.139,"Thus the Master, concluding that the United States was a necessary party, recommended dismissal, to which Idaho accepted on four grounds."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.521,368.359,"In the final report, I ask you."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,379.241,380.724,"Yes, Your Honor, he did."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.925,411.274,"Wasn't it the prospect of enforcing the decree against Indians that led him to, or at least help lead him to the conclusion that the United States was an indispensable party?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,411.274,412.369,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.369,424.831,"Well, how do those two jibe, anyway, if you -- if there is no real need of interfering with Indian rights; what enforcement against the Indians would have to take place?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,424.831,437.835,"Your Honor, the Master's basic concern was that without party status there was no guarantee that Idaho's benefits from this lawsuit could be forced upstream if they were decreed through that Zone 6 Indian fishery."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.835,454.525,"Mr. Leroy, the term has been used ""indispensable party,"" and as I read the 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that term is not used in those rules."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,454.525,474.158,"Yes, Your Honor, in the sense that Rule 19 as it now stands talks of persons to be joined if feasible and persons where in Subpart B that must be present to give an adequacy to the judgment."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.158,481.541,"It suggests a somewhat laxer standard, doesn't it, than the old indispensable party?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,481.541,492.684,"Your Honor, we would urge that to the Court and we would urge that this type of approach need be particularly flexible in a case of original jurisdiction where a substantial detriment to a precious natural resource may occur."
1979.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,492.684,501.509,"Except for the delay, what is your chief concern or concerns about having the United States made a party?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,501.509,507.581,"Your Honor, in terms of Idaho's preference we would like to see the United States involved as a party."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.223,540.003,"Well, the United States refuses to join, doesn't it?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,540.003,549.075,"The United States at this point in time, Your Honor, by a split Executive decision has determined that they would not waive sovereign immunity."
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.075,551.605,Is that really the question?
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,556.11,556.797,"Well, Your Honor, --"
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,556.797,560.076,"Wouldn't they do it by just intervening, bringing a lawsuit --"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,560.076,560.456,Your Honor --
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.456,562.302,-- and stating a claim?
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,563.746,581.242,"We are well aware of the basic proposition that it is Congress that is empowered to waive sovereign immunity but, in fact, in this case the declination to be legally involved in this case by Justice offers the same kind of bar at the expense of sovereignty."
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,581.242,581.741,I agree.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,585.022,586.144,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,588.008,600.656,"Does this Court have the power to make the United States a party if the Court should conclude that Judge Breitenstein was correct, that they are a necessary party?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,600.656,611.805,"Your Honor, we urge to the Court that in this case the Court might consider reviving the Florida v. Georgia reinstitution of special amicus-type status."
1979.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.224,679.615,"Mr. Attorney General, if you have amicus status you can't get relief, nor can relief be granted against you."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,679.615,686.439,"Well, Your Honor, we urge that the Master's finding that there need be involvement of the United States is wrong."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.633,743.046,"You are willing to take your chances on all of those, aren't you?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,747.509,749.95,"Your Honor, we are willing to take our chances --"
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.95,752.83,"There may be a lot of risks involved, but --"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,752.83,758.038,"Your Honor, we think not as to the United States for these reasons."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.038,760.987,"Whatever the risks are, you are willing to take them."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,760.987,773.2,"We are, Your Honor, and we suggest that a large portion of those risks attributable to the United States are relatively fixed and are relatively calculable and can be equitably apportioned along with the fish between Idaho, Oregon and Washington."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.2,781.15,"Mr. Attorney General, I take it -- and perhaps I am wrong -- are you giving up any theory of waiver on the part of the United States?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,781.15,782.989,"No, Your Honor, we are not at all."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.819,814.478,"Well, can you explain the way the language in Section 702 of the APA that refers to agency action?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,814.478,817.777,"Well, Your Honor, we can and we can't."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.678,857.563,"Before you get on to that, supposing before the passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946 the Attorney General of the United States had been sued in a District Court for a tort incurred by the Act which later would have been covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act, he simply asserts sovereign immunity."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,872.688,896.055,"We are suggesting that the Administrative Procedure Act by its very terms is limited to non-monetary damages and that in this case we have a classic action or failure to act in an official capacity if there be some threat to the anadromous fish by the operation of the dams, by something that is done off the Pacific Coast fishery."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.055,908.386,"So the Court could tell the United States even though the United States had said, we will not waive our sovereign immunity, a Court could say, yes, you must waive your sovereign immunity."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,908.386,914.331,We would urge the fact that Justice cannot refuse or reserve what Congress has already waived.
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.331,922.984,"If the United States intervened here and stated its own claim, it would not be a matter of waiving immunity?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,922.984,925.143,"Yes, Your Honor, I would think that --"
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.143,932.762,"Because it has -- the agencies have no power to waive immunity but they could have power to bring this lawsuit, or bring a lawsuit?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,932.762,933.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.586,1024.211,"May I inquire a little more on the subject of indispensability you touched but not really covered exhaustively, as I understand it."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1049.29,1058.797,"Your Honor, the Sohappy and U.S. v. Oregon decisions bind the Indians to a 50-percent treaty right share by decree."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.338,1074.448,As a practical matter as they go through Zone 6 don't they assume 50 percent has been taken out by Oregon and Washington before the fish get there?
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1074.448,1084.218,"Your Honor, that 50 percent is projected under the voluntary agreement into a matrix of specific numbers of fish for the specific runs and a specific entitlement to each fishery."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.489,1099.966,"Just so I can understand it, when those numbers are fixed do they fix the numbers that the Indians can take when the fish go through Zone 6?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1099.966,1102.972,"Yes, Your Honor, that is my understanding of the structure."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.972,1112.594,"So, what you are saying is that basically they would reduce the Oregon and Washington numbers without affecting the Indian numbers and there would therefore be a margin left over that has still survived on over the dam?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1112.594,1112.867,Exactly.
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.235,1154.185,"Mr. Leroy, Judge Breitenstein has used the term ""indispensable party,"" and I think you responded to an earlier question of mine since the amendment of '66 that term is no longer used in the rules."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1158.741,1166.933,"Your Honor, as I suggested in answer to your earlier question we feel that the Master's focus, regardless of term, was the adequacy of the judgment."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.284,1441.612,"Mr. Leroy, are you suggesting that the United States simply be left out as a party involuntarily and that your case proceed against Idaho and Washington?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1441.612,1454.933,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be our first prayer for relief and, in addition, we would say there are procedural devices available to involve the United States as amicus or that in any event the case ought to be allowed for a number of reasons."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.973,1563.109,I take it you feel that Idaho has been pushed around by these two larger States?
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1563.109,1576.639,"Your Honor, we do, and it is in that spirit of frustration and for that simple purpose, because there is no mutual accommodation otherwise available, that Idaho in 1975 filed this action."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1631.891,1640.95,"Are there any other interior States in which there are anadromous fish that return to spawn, such as Wyoming?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1640.95,1648.121,"Your Honor, this Columbia River system would not, though it flows through States, including Montana and Wyoming, would not --"
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1648.121,1650.311,"I mean the Snake rises in Wyoming, I think."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1650.311,1658.231,"Yes, but the Snake to the Wyoming access and the Columbia into Montana are blocked by dams and no longer available for anadromous fish."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1658.231,1659.255,"The answer is ""No."""
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1659.255,1660.064,"The answer os ""No"", sir."
1979.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1660.064,1661.268,Idaho is the only one.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1661.268,1663.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.176,1678.646,"Mr. Leroy, before you stop is it possible -- and maybe this is unrealistic question -- to give me some indication of what percentage of the run Idaho is now getting and what percentage of the run it hopes to get if it is totally successful in this litigation?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1678.646,1691.055,"Your Honor, the pleading alleges that we produce for two of those specific runs between 50 and 60 percent of the fish and that we receive back in the neighborhood of 20 percent."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.215,1719.536,"This 20 percent figure, that is the percent of the fish that originate in Idaho and return to Idaho, that is not the percent that are caught by your fishermen, is it?"
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1719.536,1722.812,"Your Honor, I am sorry; would you restate the question?"
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.812,1730.264,What does the 20 percent refer to? Is that the percent that actually get back to Idaho or is that the percent of the run that are caught by fishermen in Idaho?
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1730.264,1732.278,"No, Your Honor, it would be the percent that return."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.438,1747.013,"What I was really asking, the 20-percent figure I don't think responds to my question."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1751.566,1758.143,"Your Honor, to my knowledge that has not been established at any point in the record nor has it subject to my knowledge, outside the record."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.143,1761.492,What you really seeking to do is to increase that figure to a higher figure.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1761.492,1764.608,"Your Honor, what we are seeking in this matter is two things."
1979.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.474,1777.163,Pardon me.
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1779.13,1780.975,"Yes, to a reasonably limited extent."
1979.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.975,1782.539,"Reasonable availability, basically."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1782.539,1784.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1784.458,1806.592,"I suppose it would be possible to lose those runs even though -- under the present system -- even though there is some provision for escapement to maintain the runs, it would still be possible to lose them because of what happens between escapement and Idaho."
1979.67_orig,0,21172,david_h_leroy,,1806.592,1819.433,"Well, Your Honor, the runs have been in recent years depleted despite Idaho's best efforts to attempt an allocation in a number of fashions to preserve the run."
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1850.137,1852.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.905,1908.612,"As I understand it, in that area the Indians don't have any treaty rights."
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1908.612,1909.409,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.954,1912.619,Up to Bonneville Dam.
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1912.619,1919.693,"That is correct, although there is litigation now with the Yakimas attempting to assert their rights to fish in the lower river, but that is --"
1979.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1919.693,1921.624,But as of now the Indians --
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1921.624,1923.584,They have no such rights declared.
1979.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1923.584,1925.4,You said that is 130 miles.
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1925.4,1926.542,One hundred and thirty miles.
1979.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.65,1951.74,"And that fishery, that is in both States, Oregon and Washington?"
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1951.74,1953.884,"That is in both States, in Oregon and Washington."
1979.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.393,1960.323,Is that stretch of the river the boundary between the two States?
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1960.323,1963.073,"Yes, it is, Your Honor; it is the boundary between both States."
1979.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.073,1966.944,What is it that prevents those fish from ever getting to Idaho?
1979.67_orig,1,32553,james_a_redden,,1966.944,1974.318,"Well, because by the nature of the fish itself they are spawned or hatched in the lower Columbia River and that is the area to which they return."
1979.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2801.139,2804.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.67_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3829.294,3831.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.67_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3831.303,3840.936,"You are going to tell us at some point why the United States isn't in, or why it doesn't want to be in, or whether it does want to be in, I take it?"
1979.67_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3844.027,3844.239,I will.
1979.67_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3844.239,3863.066,"I would like to hear, Mr. Claiborne, any additional authorities you have to cite in addition to those of your memorandum of April 26, 1979 that indicate why the United States as trustee for the Indians is an indispensable party."
1979.67_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3872.968,3884.214,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe Texas v. New Mexico involved the indispensability of the United States in its role as trustee for Indian water rights."
1979.67_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3884.214,3898.145,"Texas v. New Mexico was a one-paragraph per curiam decided February 25, 1957 no purported reasoning whatever, simply a statement of a result."
1979.67_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3898.145,3911.9,"But that result Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was based on the report of the Special Master which had been reproduced for the convenience of the Court, and the papers now before the Court to indicate precisely because one couldn't judge it from the single-line per curiam."

1979.67_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4628.963,4651.7,"Mr. Attorney General, is it possible in the management of the commercial and sports fishery below Bonneville to effect a greater escapement of fish that would go to Idaho without affecting an escapement of a greater number of fish that would go elsewhere?"
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4651.7,4656.02,"Yes, Your Honor, we urge that it is so possible in the short run."
1979.67_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4656.02,4668.031,The Attorney General of the State of Washington seemed to be arguing that there would have to be an escapement of a great many other fish that were never destined for Idaho.
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4668.031,4671.644,"We are not certain on the merits, once we hear the evidence that that would be so, Your Honor."
1979.67_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4672.683,4673.814,That is part of the merit.
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4673.814,4674.274,Yes.
1979.67_orig,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4711.139,4723.347,How are these three runs reduced by the commercial or sports fishery below Bonneville?
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4723.347,4726.288,There is an extremely complex set of figures.
1979.67_orig,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4726.288,4729.572,I take it that the commercial fishery doesn't affect these three runs.
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4734.216,4738.955,"Your Honor, it would be our contention that the commercial fishery does affect these three runs."
1979.67_orig,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4738.955,4742.185,How else are the runs affected by fishing?
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4742.185,4753.94,"And, in addition, the record will show that there is substantial sports fishery in that first five zones coming in from the Columbia River as well under the exclusive regulation of Oregon and Washington."
1979.67_orig,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4763.733,4775.811,"Of course it may turn out that Washington and Oregon, either commercially or sportswise, aren't really affecting your three runs substantially?"
1979.67_orig,4,21172,david_h_leroy,,4775.811,4779.523,"Your Honor, we are more than willing to explore that should the Court give us the opportunity."
1979.67_orig,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4833.76,4834.529,"Thank you, gentlemen."
