1995.94-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.63,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1664, Stacey Koon v. United States, 94-8842, Laurence Powell v. United States."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,12.569,14.93,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.853,208.459,"Mr. Olson, let me ask about the first point that you make in your argument, and which I guess you're coming to now, whether in deciding this question we use the abuse of discretion standard or we decide de novo whether the particular factor is allowable under the guidelines."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,210.7,211.431,"Well, I--"
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.431,221.176,"Because what is being contended by the Government is that certain of these factors are not lawful factors, that the guidelines do not permit them to be used."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,248.895,249.576,--What the--
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.576,250.806,--should bother fighting about what standard to use.
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,250.806,258.772,"--The answer to that question is... indeed, the answer, I can state directly that it does make a great deal of difference, because it is an experience that sentencing judges get."
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.768,286.95,"I understand, but you're missing my point."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,307.694,316.32,"--The answer to the question, if there is an abuse of discretion, it is unlawful, but it is important that that abuse of discretion standard take place."
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.822,322.262,"Well, if it makes you feel better I'm willing to decide it that way, but I'm going to be asking myself the same question."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,323.914,337.063,"--Well, the decision itself as to whether or not a case falls within the guidelines involves the ascertainment of the facts of a particular case and deciding whether the facts of that case make it unusual or atypical in a particular situation."
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.404,351.584,"That's a different question, whether a particular factor that could in some circumstances be used should have been used in this case, and I will acknowledge, and I don't think the Government contests that that is subject to abuse of discretion."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,355.026,362.561,"--The factor is allowable, according to the Sentencing Commission, to which the authority to make those decisions was explicitly delegated by Congress."
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.844,385.577,"--Now you're arguing the merits, and that's a different question."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,388.158,389.178,"Well, the... they're--"
1995.94-1664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.178,390.199,--and I'm happy to discuss that.
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,390.199,393.211,--We submit that they're tightly interwoven among one another.
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,393.211,401.186,"I think you're saying that this case cannot involve a question of lawfulness versus unlawfulness, is that what you're saying?"
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,401.186,410.862,What we're saying is that the authority to determine whether or not a departure could exist from the Sentencing Guidelines was delegated by Congress to the Sentencing Commission.
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,422.389,430.965,"And because this is not a case involving the application of an off limits consideration, the issue here cannot be an issue, whether it was lawful or not."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,430.965,431.666,Exactly.
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,431.666,436.749,"You start with the premise that it was lawful, and you say, within the realm of lawfulness, what can it do?"
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,436.749,437.5,That's--
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.5,453.689,"So that... I mean, your case, then, is really not so much a case about what the standard ought to be, it's a case that's going to turn on whether we agree with you that in fact there can be a lawfulness versus unlawfulness decision about particular factors or reasons in this case."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,453.689,455.672,--As this Court indicated in the Williams decision--
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.672,456.881,Couldn't we see the case that way?
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,456.881,471.043,"--Well, except to the extent that it seems to me that that decision is constrained by the scheme set up by Congress which delegated certain authorities to make... authority to make those decisions to the Sentencing Commission, and the Sentencing Commission in this case has made those decisions."
1995.94-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.043,480.838,"Well, the record... if there's no difference between the abuse of discretion standard and the de novo standard, we might as well dismiss this petition as improperly granted, because that's the only question raised in the petition."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,480.838,483.74,"We are not agreeing with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,503.223,513.259,"But the reason that this is an... as it were, is an easy issue as you see it is that there cannot be an issue of law here."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,516.241,516.952,In--
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.952,521.654,"And I suppose that if we all agree with you there, there isn't very much left to argue about."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,521.654,540.186,"--Well... well, I think that the case is that simple, because the... as Justice Breyer explained in his article in the Hofstra Law Review in 1988, the Sentencing Commission explicitly stated that most factors that might be eligible as departure factors have already been decided by the commission as eligible for consideration."
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.841,578.972,"Yes, but you are also saying that there can be no unusualness question which raises an issue of law as distinct from an issue of discretion, and the reason it cannot raise an issue of law is that the only issues of law are issues involving whether something has been explicitly taken off the table or not."
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,579.863,584.055,I believe that that's a fair understanding of the guidelines themselves and--
1995.94-1664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.055,585.157,--But is it understanding of your argument?
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,585.157,599.576,"--And... because we're basing that argument on the guidelines and this Court's decision in Williams, I must hasten to say that it's conceivable, I suppose, although I have not thought of one, where a pure question of law with respect to a departure factor could come up."
1995.94-1664,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.576,604.878,"Well, it's obvious that there... I mean, that isn't... you could... isn't the answer, it depends?"
1995.94-1664,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,643.337,650.883,"Clearly that is the case, except to the extent that the only argument that I would offer with respect to that second category is that that... if it's purely an interpretation--"
1995.94-1664,1,45224,william_j_kopeny,,788.644,801.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.319,884.768,"And as to them, de novo standard."
1995.94-1664,1,45224,william_j_kopeny,,885.77,891.494,"Your Honor, I think that the words that Justice Breyer used was plenary standard, but what's important, I think, is that--"
1995.94-1664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.494,894.205,"Well, isn't that what we're getting at by de novo here?"
1995.94-1664,1,45224,william_j_kopeny,,894.205,906.093,"--Well, I hesitate to use the word de novo, because the Ninth Circuit called what it did in this case de novo, but reached a conclusion which Justice O'Connor said in Williams was forbidden to the reviewing court, and that is to determine whether it was an appropriate--"
1995.94-1664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.093,916.798,"Maybe they did it wrong, but just as an abstract matter, I think what you are describing as the standard is what we normally describe as a de novo standard."
1995.94-1664,1,45224,william_j_kopeny,,916.798,917.639,"--I think so, too."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1632.647,1637.031,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1664,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.202,1676.58,"Well, you know, if Congress hadn't made any provision for the... what standard to use, that might be a good policy argument, but it's nothing more than a policy argument."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1680.784,1688.448,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are... there is a statute that specifically addresses the standard of review for Sentencing Guidelines--"
1995.94-1664,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.448,1691.19,"Yes, and it doesn't say anything like that, as I recall."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1691.19,1718.147,"--Well, the statute that governs this, which is set out in our brief at page 6a of the appendix, provides that the court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of witnesses and shall accept findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous, which is, of course, the typical standard of review for findings of fact, and shall give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts, and there are two significant points I'd like to make about the last clause."
1995.94-1664,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.147,1725.994,"Well, you've left out one provision, which is where your... where the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing a district court's decision to depart."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1771.863,1772.835,"Well, the Supreme--"
1995.94-1664,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.835,1788.276,"So I thought that that added some support to the notion that at least sometimes the court of appeals is supposed to pay attention to what the district court says where that's appropriate, where the district court knows more about it, particularly in respect to whether or not a particular set of circumstances is unusual."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1788.276,1798.113,"--Let me, if I may, Justice Breyer, address the statutory point that you raised and then turn to the policy consideration of what a district court should do and what a court of appeals should do."
1995.94-1664,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1854.399,1858.514,"You really think... I mean, you have 500, 700 district court judges."
1995.94-1664,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1892.084,1893.136,--Well--
1995.94-1664,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3315.39,3328.289,"Let me address that point, because in the ad damnum portion of the Rivera case the court indeed sent that back to the district court and said, if you find the need for restitution in that case particularly unusual, please explain your reasons."
1995.94-1664,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.56,3386.77,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
1995.94-1664,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3386.77,3387.331,--Thank you.
1995.94-1664,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.331,3387.852,The case is submitted.
