1985.84-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.121,We will hear arguments next in Sorenson against the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States and the United States.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,104.52,123.248,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Court is asked to construe Section 2331 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, or OBRA."
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.344,275.076,What group of children do you say was in that latter category?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,275.076,296.895,"--Children, Justice White... in order to qualify for an earned income credit benefit, an applicant must reside with a dependent child, and the benefit only goes to low income families, so the children I am speaking about are children in families eligible for earned income credit benefits."
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.895,307.111,And the problem is that the Secretary wants to take that credit and withhold it?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,307.111,307.829,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.829,311.203,For the benefit of some other group of children?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,311.203,312.546,To help--
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.546,319.106,To make the applicant pay his debts.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,319.106,325.4,--To reduce the cost of the AFDC program.
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.193,335.77,I see--
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,335.77,339.456,"The expression ""refund""--"
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.456,340.066,--Let me just be clear.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,349.109,357.903,--That was the only place that it could go in 1984.
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.238,379.174,Where do these withholdings go today?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,390.296,394.264,There are several different places it could go today.
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.237,430.906,And would it redound to the benefit of the former parent or the--
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,430.906,440.84,"In the limited situation in which a state was collecting for a non-welfare family, that could be the case, Justice White."
1985.84-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.84,441.15,--I see.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,441.15,455.005,"But that would be a situation in which presumably, since that child would not be on welfare, it would be taking funds from a needy child in an earned income credit benefit family to support a child that was less needy."
1985.84-1686,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.264,529.6,"Well, it looks to me like the biggest problem for your position, Mr. Greenfield, is that Section 6401(b) specifically defines an earned income credit as an overpayment of taxes."
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,529.6,530.333,"Yes, it does."
1985.84-1686,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.333,535.502,And it is subject to interception then under Section 6402(c).
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,535.502,550.309,"Let me address the relationship between Section 6402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 464 of the Social Security Act, which is our response to this argument made by the Secretary."
1985.84-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.301,691.674,"Mr. Greenfield, I have a little trouble with all of the sections."
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,697.735,697.985,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.985,703.233,And Section 6401 and 6402 refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,703.233,703.905,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.905,711.137,And there are some other... 454 is a section of the Social Security Act.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,711.137,711.574,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.505,929.031,Would you just let me ask this one further question about the language?
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,952.101,953.116,Justice Stevens--
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.116,955.897,I understand your point about purpose and so forth.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,955.897,963.768,"--Justice Stevens, if you look at the language as it appears in the statute, and it is underscored in Subsection (a)--"
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.768,964.221,Right.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,964.221,970.453,--it doesn't say payable as refunds for federal taxes paid.
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.811,975.341,So you take the--
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,975.341,980.075,"""# refunds of federal taxes paid, payable to such individual. """
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.143,1012.984,"--Are you saying in effect, then, that the common clause, or whether it is a phrase, ""as refunds federal taxes paid"" modifies amounts, ""which precedes it""--"
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,1012.984,1013.078,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.078,1014.437,"--rather than the word ""payable"", which follows it."
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,1014.437,1015.015,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.015,1022.419,"If it did modify payable, then you would have a much more difficult case, an ambiguity."
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,1023.247,1024.591,And there is a reason.
1985.84-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.591,1033.618,Because you are saying it is really a qualification of the substantive amount rather than a description of the procedure of payment.
1985.84-1686,0,37947,peter_greenfield,,1033.618,1062.966,"That's correct, Justice Stevens, and the reason for this seemingly rather awkward phrasing, and that is that while the money is held by the Treasury it isn't yet a refund, so it is an amount that would be a refund if it were paid, but while held by the Treasury it is technically simply an accounting item."
1985.84-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1105.886,1106.62,Very well.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1111.836,1118.631,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three points I would like to make this morning."
1985.84-1686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.91,1325.251,What section of the code again is it that makes earned income credit overpayment?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1325.251,1327.486,Section 6401(b).
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.389,1334.388,And that was not included in the sheet that was handed out?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1334.388,1336.981,"I believe, that the petitioner passed out."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.981,1337.825,Yes.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1337.825,1342.838,The Second and Tenth Circuits--
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.838,1344.526,"Would you help me a little, because I want to coordinate."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1347.509,1350.039,--It was part of the '54 Code.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.039,1356.318,"Well, this is long... how could the reference to earned income credits be in the '54 Code."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1356.318,1363.629,It was amended when... the earned income credit was enacted in 1975 as part of the Tax Reduction Act.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.872,1385.184,I really am asking a very elementary question.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1392.149,1399.506,"Well, it was last amended as relevant here in 1975."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.358,1418.482,"So that was done in '75, before there was any intercept program."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1418.482,1419.061,"Yes, that's correct."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.606,1426.526,So this set up the procedure by which the earned income credit would be paid to the person who needed it.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1426.526,1445.706,"--That is exactly correct, because in 1975 when Congress amended 6401(b) to define earned income credit as an overpayment, 6402(a) already provided that in the case of any overpayment, the Secretary was required to refund it."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.706,1454.686,What happened in the case for a person who was entitled to an earned income credit but didn't earn enough money to file a tax return?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1456.232,1460.215,I don't believe they would get the credit unless they filed a return and claimed it.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.215,1465.26,What were the requirements for being eligible for earned income credit?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1467.26,1478.318,"Well, to be an eligible individual, you either have to be a head of household, a surviving spouse, or a married individual supporting a dependent child who lives with you."
1985.84-1686,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1518.725,1529.142,"If you file a joint tax return, as true in this case, is the $500 limit applicable, or does it go up to $1,000?"
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1529.142,1545.261,"I believe only one person would be eligible because in order to be eligible you have to be the one entitled to claim a dependency exemption, meaning you have to provide more than half the support, so only one of the spouses would be eligible to claim the credit."
1985.84-1686,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1545.261,1551.696,"The $10,000 income limit applies only to the person entitled to claim the credit?"
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1551.696,1552.382,That is--
1985.84-1686,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1552.382,1554.49,Even if the spouse earned a lot more than that?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1554.49,1565.049,"--Well, presumably if the spouse earned a lot more, the person claiming the credit might find it difficult to prove that they provided half the support of the dependent, and then they wouldn't be eligible for the credit in the first place."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.049,1570.329,"May I ask just one other question to get the sequence in order, if I may."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1579.746,1580.386,That's correct.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.386,1584.807,"Now, that text itself doesn't refer to the earned income credit."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1595.538,1603.769,"As far as I am aware, Justice Stevens, Congress did not mention earned income credit one way or the other when it passed the intercept program."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.219,1811.655,"--Mr. Farber, you have in your brief some indication of the amounts of money involved."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1820.901,1824.446,Section 6305 has not been widely used.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.446,1825.336,Has it been used at all?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1825.336,1838.941,"My understanding is, it has been used several thousand times, but it is not very cost efficient, and requires locating the person who is indebted, locating its assets, and then using somewhat cumbersome means to actually reduce those assets to possession."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.375,1854.419,A moment ago you said they hadn't even mentioned the earned income credit at the time of the 1981--
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1854.419,1855.996,They didn't focus in on earned income.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.996,1860.712,--I am asking you about use of this power as a means of collecting from earned income credits.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1862.368,1863.555,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.754,1876.269,"I know it is not in the record, but you do go outside the record from time to time."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1881.516,1886.265,--I have no specific indication as to whether it has ever been used.
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.265,1889.592,--Yet you rely heavily on the fact that that power was there for several years.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1889.592,1908.739,"What I am saying is that the power is there, that it could be used, and that if the Court were to hold that these earned income credits couldn't be intercepted, it would not be immunizing these credits from collections for past due support, as petitioners suggest, because they still could be subject to collection."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.947,1946.755,Unless it thought there was a federal interest in having the earned income credit go to the people who had these dependent children who needed money.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1946.755,1974.73,"--Well, Your Honor, except that it didn't... when it authorized collection of child support as delinquent taxes, it didn't pass any exemption for earned income credit, and so there is no limitation to stop the states from seeking to use this power, and so Congress has not protected earned income credits in this earlier broad power, and so there is no reason to believe that it intended to do so when it enhanced this collection authority."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.806,1981.883,"What I am suggesting is, it didn't really need to, because the practice was so clear that they never even tried to invoke it."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1981.883,1984.07,"--Well, I don't believe there is any indication of that."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.07,1988.254,"Well, you have acknowledged that to the best of your knowledge they never tried to invoke it."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,1988.254,1992.081,I am not aware of any instances in which they collected that way.
1985.84-1686,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2038.687,2060.914,"Mr. Farber, perhaps I have been around too long, but years and years ago, wasn't there another federal earned income credit in the Code, perhaps the '39 Code, by which one obtained a deduction for earned income as contrasted with unearned income such as dividends, interest, capital gains?"
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2060.914,2068.565,"I am not familiar with that specific provision, Justice Blackmun, but there have been many provisions in the code dealing with earned income."
1985.84-1686,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2085.965,2090.308,"I think I have been around too long, but I am sure there was one back in the thirties and forties."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2090.308,2092.744,"I don't doubt it, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1686,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2092.744,2094.992,That I have been around too long?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2095.789,2096.805,"No, I didn't mean that."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.033,2129.151,"Don't you have to concede that there is somewhat of an ambiguity in that provision of the Social Security Act as to what that phrase modifies as payable, what payable applies to?"
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2129.151,2135.523,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would concede that, because if there wasn't an ambiguity there, I don't think we would have lost this case in the Second and Tenth--"
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.523,2135.773,Exactly.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2145.863,2155.906,"--Well, that is the problem, Your Honor, is that these two sections, 6402(c) and Section 464 were both passed concurrently in 1981 as part of OBRA."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.109,2200.293,"Yes, but that expressly defines as overpayments... that provision was passed in '75."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2200.293,2201.433,--Yes.
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.433,2203.073,And wasn't changed at all in '80.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2203.073,2205.541,"That is true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.541,2209.493,So it may be you should ignore it.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2211.43,2236.466,"Well, but the language it used is all encompassing, because when it chose to add this intercept provision, it amended Section A, which directs the refunds of overpayment to say the Secretary shall, subject to Subsection (c), refund the amount of any overpayment, and then in Subsection (c) it says, in the case of any overpayment the amount of past due support is to be applied against that overpayment."
1985.84-1686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.336,2256.318,Don't the courts ordinarily give some deference to the construction of the Secretary in the event there is an ambiguity?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2256.318,2268.516,"--Well, certainly when regulations have been promulgated there is great deference, but I suppose it might be viewed as somewhat bootstrapping if we came here and said we are right because we said we are right."
1985.84-1686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.516,2270.452,"Well, you have been doing it for years."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2277.623,2280.652,Maybe I haven't been here enough to get the party line.
1985.84-1686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.652,2281.651,You will.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2282.885,2296.035,"In our view, if the decision below were to be reversed, you would be creating this conflict among concurrent sections, and I again would emphasize--"
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.035,2304.829,"Well, we would just be saying that we will construe the Internal Revenue Code in the light of the Social Security--"
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2304.829,2312.827,"--Well, except that the Internal Revenue Code provision purports to be an independent authority."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.236,2351.999,"--Mr. Farber, you keep relying on an authorization that they never used for six years."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2368.212,2371.539,"--Well, Congress may work at cross purposes sometimes, but I don't think it is quite--"
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.539,2372.944,Clearly here if you are right.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2372.944,2375.787,"--Well, I don't think it is that clear, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.787,2388.938,"Isn't it true that this is subsidy for a group of needy people that the federal government is financing, and if it is diverted, it goes to the states to pay off some debts by the same group of people."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2395.7,2406.602,"Well, I think... yes, Your Honor, I think so because over the past 35 years it has expressed increasing concern about the rapid growth of people, families on AFDC."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.346,2427.252,"In the past it has collected them out of the assets of the people who owe the money, their own tax money."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2427.252,2440.807,"--Well, Justice Stevens, what happens here is that because someone like petitioner's husband did not pay his child support, and it is undisputed he is in debt for child support, his former wife had to go on welfare."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.957,2461.97,And to the extent that you are successful here the honoring of the support will be financed by the federal government.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2461.97,2467.109,"Well, that might well--"
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.109,2467.531,Isn't that true?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2475.497,2486.211,"--That same argument could be made with respect to unemployment benefits, and as I have pointed out, when Congress enacted Section 6305, it specifically repealed the exemption for unemployment benefits."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.796,2512.809,"Except that here the benefit title really was intended for the children rather than for the man, as in the case of the unemployment compensation."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2512.809,2514.776,"Well, I am not sure that that is entirely true."
1985.84-1686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.964,2518.573,He can't get it if he doesn't have children.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2518.573,2526.257,"--That is true, Your Honor, but it really was an incentive for low income people to work rather than to receive welfare."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.144,2540.143,That incentive is somewhat removed by this intercept.
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2540.143,2543.079,"Well, not entirely, Justice White."
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.287,2582.561,"Well, if one of the purposes is to get people to pay their obligations in the future, it certainly isn't very... this intercept program certainly isn't very effective."
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2582.561,2585.513,I don't think I follow that.
1985.84-1686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.513,2592.98,Is one of the purposes to urge these debtors to pay their debts in the future as they accrue?
1985.84-1686,1,39228,richard_farber,,2592.98,2602.57,"I believe it is, but maybe more principally to try and collect against those people who have no intention of voluntarily paying, and there is a huge amount out there."
1985.84-1686,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2739.358,2742.061,Very well.
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,2746.449,2747.2,Please.
1985.84-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.252,2861.153,"You say... I see in the copy of the section I've got where... the requirement, the Secretary has been notified by a state in accordance with Section... does it use, in accordance with the Social Security somewhere else in that--"
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,2861.153,2870.82,"--That is the only place it appears, Justice Rehnquist, and as we explain in more detail in the briefs, at first reading one would think that the phrase"
1985.84-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.459,2878.958,"--One certainly would, yes."
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,2878.958,2889.5,"However, there is a good reason for it not staying with that conclusion, and that is that Section 464 does not impose any notice obligation on states."
1985.84-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.645,2930.955,Would the Secretary ever be notified by a state so that your construction would make sense there?
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,2930.955,2931.5,Yes.
1985.84-1686,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.678,2961.489,And that is the section that requires the reduction?
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,2961.489,2968.408,Section 464 of the Social Security Act requires interception of refunds of federal taxes paid.
1985.84-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.063,3066.227,"Mr. Greenfield, I understood your response about Section 6402(c) as to which phrase was modified by the notice requirement in there to be in part that Section 464 didn't deal with notification by the state."
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,3066.227,3069.789,It does not impose an obligation on the state.
1985.84-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.789,3077.629,"But it does say... 464 says at the beginning, upon receiving notice from a state agency administering... so it certainly refers to it."
1985.84-1686,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,3077.629,3095.56,"It refers to notice several times; also at the end of 464(a) it refers to notice, but 464(a) is imposing an obligation on the Secretary, and when the Secretary complies with that obligation, he is acting in accordance with Section 464(a)."
1985.84-1686,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3331.027,3331.417,"Thank you, gentlemen."
