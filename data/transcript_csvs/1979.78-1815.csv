1979.78-1815,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.295,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1815, Andrus v. Shell Oil Company."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,68.142,71.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.061,216.883,"Well, do you think that is an issue here?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,217.514,220.514,The issue tested --
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.514,230.797,So initially we must decide what how are the mining laws to be construed insofar as discovery is concerned.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,230.797,238.103,"Well, this is far from a novel question in this Court, Mr. Justice White, and --"
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.103,244.006,"Well, it was a novel question in the Interior Department until recently."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,244.006,249.212,"Well, I can't agree with that proposition either."
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,249.212,255.07,"Well, it had been decided forty years ago."
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.07,258.94,"Certainly, Freeman v. Summers treat it differently than you do."
1979.78-1815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,258.94,259.302,But this is a different issue.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,259.302,268.616,"It treated it differently than other decisions of both the Interior Department and of this Court, which is what I wish to turn to --"
1979.78-1815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.616,292.704,"That is of course the big issue, but as I understand it, what you were talking about with my brother White was this, that your opponent, despite all the findings to the contrary, argues that under the traditional normal criteria of valuable discovery, these discovery meet those criteria."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,292.704,293.336,That argument --
1979.78-1815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.336,294.72,So That is an issue in this case.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,294.72,295.563,That is an issue --
1979.78-1815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.563,301.84,"And if that is true, if he is correct, then that is the end of the case, you don't get into anything else, do you?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,301.84,309.756,"Well, that is correct, although our submission is that it is not correct."
1979.78-1815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.462,313.744,Right.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,313.744,329.068,But that is a factual issue but it is mixed up with an issue of law which I think has long been settled and let me turn to the considerations that bear on that and that bear on other aspects of the case as well.
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.238,402.24,Would you concede that the Interior Department has changed its position over the years?
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,402.24,409.914,It concluded in these very cases that Freeman v. Summers was incorrect and it changes its position in these cases.
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.914,421.491,"Do you think it has the same latitude as we have held the NLRB has to change its position, or do you think it is bound to simply interpret the law?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,421.491,441.137,"Well, it can only change its position in interpretation of the law, but as I am about to demonstrate to the Court, if I may, Freeman v. Summers was inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court construing the very law that Interior misconstrued in Freeman v. Summers."
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.805,482.639,But in so doing it did change its own interpretation?
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,482.639,484.653,It certainly did.
1979.78-1815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,486.835,500.008,"Mr. Wallace, just so I am sure I follow it as you get into the statutory argument, the ultimate question, is it not, is whether or not these were ""valuable mineral deposits"" within the meaning of section 1 of the 1872 statute?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,500.008,504.249,"That is correct, Mr. Justice, and that --"
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.249,514.681,"Mr. Wallace, don't I recall that sometimes here we have approved an administrative reading and then some years later approved a quite contrary one?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,514.681,523.647,It can happen within an area of an agency's discretion to construe terms of a statute which can fairly be construed in different ways.
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.647,536.798,"Well, you don't think for example we would be free to having perhaps construed the law differently than Freeman did, to later say Freeman was correctly decided?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,536.798,558.34,"Well, the difficulty is that Freeman never purported to apply a different standard to anything but oil shale and the Interior Department over the years adhered to this Court's interpretation of the mining laws for all other minerals and there is no statutory basis for treating oil shale differently from other minerals."
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.379,941.527,Can a patent when it is finally issued be set aside for mistake of fact?
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,941.527,944.81,It can be set aside only for six years.
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.478,966.956,"So if these had actually been patented rather than just unpatented locations, they could not be set aside?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,966.956,972.537,"That is correct, so long as there was no fraud in failure to disclose."
1979.78-1815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,972.537,976.561,And that would be patents if any that issued between 1954 and 1960?
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,976.561,979.329,I am not aware of any effort to do so.
1979.78-1815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.085,1000.455,May I ask you one other question about Freeman v. Summers.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1019.198,1022.595,I am not aware that it does show that.
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.189,1115.019,"But the Interior Department's view was expressed openly immediately after the passage in 1920, wasn't it, by a set of instructions?"
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1115.019,1117.176,There were instructions that --
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.176,1122.445,Which purported to be a construction of what the law required.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1122.445,1125.907,"Yes, but the instructions did not make a mistake of law."
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.748,1223.73,"Mr. Wallace, on a factual aspect, you start out I think indicating five million acres were subject to claims that were during this time period."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1223.73,1224.784,That is an estimate.
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.784,1225.215,An estimate.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1228.446,1229.829,Not in patent.
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.829,1230.396,How large is it?
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1230.396,1234.098,"349,000 acres have been patented."
1979.78-1815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.098,1236.708,"The acreage patent was 349,000."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1236.708,1239.379,"Yes, Mr Justice."
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.453,1275.967,"Can I ask you a question, Mr. Wallace, before you get to that point."
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1316.801,1335.422,"Well, there is some play in the question of imminence in the profitability of the mine, but the consistent course of interpretation has been that it has to be imminent rather than speculative."
1979.78-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.422,1339.171,I assume that wasn't the Court's interpretation in Freeman v. Summers.
1979.78-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1339.171,1363.09,"No, it wasn't, but Freeman v. Summers in our submission an aberration from the Womble standard which was the predominant view approved by the Court over and over again, expenditure of labor and means with a reasonable prospect of success in developing a valuable mine."
1979.78-1815,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1612.598,1615.638,"Mr. Hamilton, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1615.638,1616.474,Thank you sir.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.335,1970.514,"Mr. Hamilton, let me just be sure I understand."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1970.514,1970.941,Surely.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.941,1972.96,The figures are so widely different.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1974.211,1974.39,Yes.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.39,1977.68,I understood Mr. Wallace to say there are five million acres.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1977.68,1978.775,"I'm sorry, I misspoke."
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.941,1985.191,"And you say that there is only roughly the same amount as the 349,000 that have been patented."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1985.191,1985.974,Roughly.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.798,1991.838,And does any neutral source enlighten us as to which of you is correct on this?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1991.838,1996.592,"Well, the source that I was quoting was not a neutral source, it was the government source."
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.592,1998.536,And that was as of what date?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,1998.536,2000.539,"1967, the date of the hearing."
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.539,2001.324,I see.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2002.683,2019.312,"That is the transcript, 3714 to 3744, testimony of one of their experts named Duncan based upon an extraordinary exhaustive study that had been made by the department of the claims in all of the counties in which the claims that had been filed."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.312,2021.211,What was that transcript page again?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2021.211,2021.713,Sir?
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.713,2023.803,What was that transcript reference?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2023.803,2028.679,Transcript 3714-3744.
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.033,2036.924,More valuable than any of the Iranian ones?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2036.924,2037.765,Much larger.
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.765,2038.085,What?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2038.085,2043.203,Much larger than Iran or Saudi Arabia.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.541,2047.622,But true.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2047.622,2050.617,But true.
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.294,2175.833,I thought President Filmore was President in '52.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2175.833,2176.368,Sir?
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.368,2181.926,I thought Filmore was President in '52.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2181.926,2183.199,Did I say '62?
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.199,2184.252,"No, you said '52."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2184.252,2185.52,I said 1852.
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.52,2187.956,"Buchanan was President I thought from 1850 -- no, 1857."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2187.956,2194.419,"I will defer to your greater knowledge, but I think it was vetoed."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.293,2400.281,Where does it begin in the government's brief?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2400.281,2400.564,Sir?
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.564,2402.468,Where does it begin in the government's brief?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2402.468,2420.074,"Yes, it is in the government's brief, page 19."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.121,2474.897,Do you have that supplement in your brief?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2474.897,2478.619,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.619,2479.745,I don't recall it.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2479.745,2503.287,"Now, it was against that background that Congress and the Executive Branch found themselves facing a very serious problem when this great valuable deposit of oil shale was discovered because it was not hard rock mineral and all of the minerals before that had been hard rock minerals, gold, silver, what have you, except for oil which had been made the subject of a special act in 1897."
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.542,2542.212,"You have one mistake, Mr. Hamilton."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2542.212,2544.368,Yes?
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.368,2547.553,"If you pronounce placer that way out in our country, you get your claim cancelled."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2547.553,2550.081,Placer.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.081,2551.422,Placer.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2551.422,2555.329,"Placer, I'm sorry."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.726,2571.886,"While you are stopped, is there any parallel here that you see between what happened with iron up in the iron range and the development of new methods to exploit taconite which reopened the whole mining industry?"
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2571.886,2578.379,"Sir, it would be analogous, yes, sir."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2799.947,2806.137,I hope you are going to save enough time to make your point on estoppel.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2806.137,2807.986,"How much time do I have, Your Honor."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.986,2811.222,You have about ten minutes left.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2811.222,2812.477,"Anyway, it is in the brief."
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.002,2873.999,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to cause you to lose the thread of your argument."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2885.175,2886.289,Except oil shale.
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.289,2887.063,Except oil shale.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2888.903,2903.097,"What happened was the act provided that none of these minerals should be available for patent but should only be available under lease, and it included oil shale."
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.097,2903.458,Right.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2903.458,2911.443,The oil shale people said that is going to kill our claims if it goes in like that because we've got these claims and we haven't got patents.
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.669,2924.171,Right.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2924.171,2927.996,"Because had they not done that, they would have been wiped out."
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.476,2937.949,Didn't they also save claims for other minerals as well?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2937.949,2943.804,"As a practical matter, there weren't any of those because those minerals had all been withdrawn for years because as soon as they --"
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.804,2944.685,I see.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2944.685,2948.077,"-- had been classified, they were withdrawn and you couldn't stake a claim."
1979.78-1815,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.077,2949.721,All right.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,2949.721,2961.174,So they filed the instructions following the original decision based on the last paragraph of Castle v. Womble.
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.409,3288.996,"Well, the Ninth Circuit was reversed in Hibi, which the government cites in its brief, because this Court said the government could not be estopped?"
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3291.064,3301.371,"With all respect, we do not read that as meaning that this Court has held that the government cannot be estopped."
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.033,3314.875,I agree.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3314.875,3317.209,Not at all.
1979.78-1815,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.466,3386.0,"Does that differ too much from an administrative construction, a long continuing administrative construction?"
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3386.0,3400.932,"Yes, I think it does, because in the case of long administrative construction, one, it seems to me, is not dealing with equities so much in terms of dealing with the rights of a particular citizen, one is dealing with a principle of government."
1979.78-1815,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.568,3447.426,But then you would have to show the reliance element.
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3447.426,3452.969,"That is correct and we argue in our briefs, absolutely, whereas if my philosophy is right one shouldn't."
1979.78-1815,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.969,3468.283,"Mr. Hamilton, before you sit down, I was going to ask you what is the difference between question two and question three which you listed among three additional questions on page three of your brief."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3472.007,3472.782,Yes.
1979.78-1815,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3472.782,3473.643,Is that the difference?
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3473.643,3474.42,That is the difference.
1979.78-1815,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3478.147,3479.576,"Yes, I understand."
1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3479.576,3480.741,"Yes, that is the difference and we --"

1979.78-1815,1,24061,fowler_hamilton,,3487.544,3489.412,"If I may, I will just take thirty seconds more."
1979.78-1815,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.263,3533.491,"Thank you, Mr. Hemilton."
1979.78-1815,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3537.178,3564.834,"I would like to say first that there are an estimated five million acres which I have gotten from the Department of the Interior, is based on an extrapolation from the study that is in the record which relates to only the county in the area in Colorado, and that extrapolation then would take in the other counties in Colorado and the areas in Wyoming and Utah which were not included in this study of court house filings."
1979.78-1815,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3767.066,3777.02,"Could I just ask you, if we agree with you on the only question you presented in your petition, should we remand on the estoppel --"

1979.78-1815,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3803.158,3807.506,"Well, that is true if you had never petitioned for certiorari, too."
1979.78-1815,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3807.506,3817.138,"We did and the Court granted the petition and -- the District Court passed on the question, we think the question is a clear one, that there is no basis for a holding of estoppel."
1979.78-1815,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3855.569,3856.283,"Thank you, gentlemen."
