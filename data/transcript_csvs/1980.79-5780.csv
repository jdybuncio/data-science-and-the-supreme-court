1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.991,"At 1 o'clock we will hear arguments promptly in Weaver v. Graham, the Governor of Florida."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,35.589,38.791,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-5780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.545,125.664,And that was by statute?
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,125.664,126.381,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,279.164,284.734,You suggest that a state could not abolish parole entirely?
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,284.734,309.449,"Not for those who are already in the system, Your Honor, because that brings me immediately, Mr. Chief Justice, to the classic definitions which the Court has given to an ex post facto loss, it's the Calder case in 1798, in which we speak of the critical time is the time of the commission of the offense."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.683,402.645,"Your case really comes down to the proposition that you expressed when you said, the state which had a parole system could not abolish it with respect to prisoners already convicted while that parole system was on the books."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,402.645,407.83,"That was our opinion, although of course you would not reach that issue in this case."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.284,413.267,How do you distinguish?
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,413.267,418.921,"There are some differences between parole, obviously it being a much more subjective matter."
1980.79-5780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.482,452.159,"What if Florida after the commission of the offense but previous to the trial expanded the type of information that could be used by the trial judge in sentencing the defendant, if he were convicted."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,463.4,464.635,"--There are cases on that, Your Honor."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.711,519.62,"What if a state adopts a code of evidence under the new code, after a given person has committed a crime, before he is tried, before he is charged with the crime."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,529.078,542.236,"It might very well be xx the fourth definition of Calder, although there are some interesting cases which we did not brief because I sought only to brief those decisions of the Court which related to punishment."
1980.79-5780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.747,667.466,"Mr. MacDonald, may I just ask this one question."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,674.72,675.67,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.67,681.624,"But would it not be more appropriate in this case to focus on the date of the sentencing or the date of the conviction, because--"
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,681.624,682.309,Indeed it would.
1980.79-5780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.309,691.081,"--as of the date of the trial the judge could adjust or... I mean, the fact that the offense occurred before and then he was tried afterwards, I couldn't see there'd be any unfairness."
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,691.081,693.381,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I could not agree with you more."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,761.555,777.381,"Are you suggesting that the judicial system, or the society must respond to what the convicted criminal thinks about the whole problem, by that bottom line suggestion?"
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,777.381,783.885,"--Your Honor, in a plea bargaining situation, one surrenders certain rights."
1980.79-5780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.703,791.657,"Well, does it make any difference whether the person pleads guilty or is found guilty, for this purpose?"
1980.79-5780,0,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,791.657,792.491,I think not for this purpose.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1421.496,1425.115,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.514,1628.377,"Mr. Attorney General, suppose the criminal statute providing for the penalty said, the penalty for this crime shall be 15 years, less any good time earned at the rate of five days for every day of good behavior."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1651.075,1653.094,"That's true, but Mr. Justice White--"
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.094,1656.046,Wouldn't your argument follow?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1656.046,1657.329,"--Yes, I would follow the same argument."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.541,1676.71,I understand that.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1676.71,1677.36,"All right, sir."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.36,1693.319,"But nevertheless, nevertheless, if prior to amendment the warden refused to give him good time for days that he behaved, I suppose the warden would be in trouble, wouldn't he?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1693.319,1694.671,He would be in trouble; yes.
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.36,1712.732,"Well, the warden couldn't... the warden couldn't tell him in advance either that, well, you may have earned a lot of good time up to date, but from here on you don't earn any good time."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1712.732,1717.934,"Justice White, you're assuming things that I don't believe exist at all."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.457,1725.307,"No, I'm sure he wouldn't."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1727.059,1728.192,I would hope so.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.059,1736.097,"Mr. Attorney General, you do recognize that this man loses four days a month?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1736.097,1737.764,"No, sir, I do not."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.026,1783.395,But he still loses the four days?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1783.395,1784.045,Sir?
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.045,1785.795,He still loses four days?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1785.795,1787.397,Not necessarily.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.397,1795.12,"What you're saying is, although he loses four days, he can get some more days out of something else?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1795.853,1797.236,"More so; yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.838,1801.04,But you still admit he loses more than four days?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1801.04,1802.774,--He could lose four days.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1803.357,1805.476,"No, doesn't he lose four days?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1805.476,1806.944,Not necessarily.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.428,1814.681,Can he get ten days like he did before?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1814.681,1816.633,Not under the statutory--
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.633,1817.333,Can he get ten--
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1817.333,1819.318,"--5, 10, and 15; no."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.318,1820.651,--So he loses four?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1820.651,1822.37,He can get it in other ways.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.37,1822.903,Sure.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1829.091,1844.367,I'd still be making the argument based primarily on the fact that under Florida law parole and probation and gain time are a matter of legislative grace.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.66,1865.577,After it's given?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1865.577,1866.846,After it's given.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.746,1872.516,It can be withdrawn after it's given?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1872.516,1875.051,"--Just hear me out, please, sir."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.921,1913.51,"What do you do with... what was the name of that case, that your colleagues rely on here?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1918.044,1926.134,That case is an illustration of what we spoke about just minutes ago.
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.952,1984.173,So you're deprived of the right to earn good time credits for six months?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1984.173,1985.256,"Yes, that's it."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.752,2013.692,So you distinguish your case from Scafati in saying that the good time statute was separate from the sentencing statute?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2013.692,2015.708,Absolutely; absolutely.
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.375,2045.144,Isn't that a pretty theoretical distinction?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2045.144,2046.111,Beg pardon?
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.111,2049.281,Isn't that a pretty theoretical distinction?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2070.629,2072.045,"Yes, I think it does."
1980.79-5780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.045,2074.331,"It has to for you to win, doesn't it?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2074.331,2080.734,"It makes it a very strong distinction, absolutely, sir; absolutely."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.298,2130.433,"Before you do that, if I may just be clear on one thing."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2147.279,2154.116,"I don't think the Supreme Court touched on that in the Harris case; no, sir."
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.891,2199.929,"--But when this law went into effect, the minimum that this defendant could have received went up, didn't it?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2199.929,2211.052,The maximum went down but the minimum went up.
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2211.052,2217.958,There's more discretion?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2217.958,2219.758,"Yes, there is more discretion."
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.758,2224.795,But it's discretion that can be used against him as well as for him?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2224.795,2226.231,"Yes, that's true."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.901,2240.888,May I ask one other question on your basic theory before we get to whether the package is better or worse.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2273.545,2275.578,"No, sir, I don't believe so."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.783,2288.635,Till he actually gets it.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2288.635,2306.38,"But now, if he is eligible, and the requirements are not changed and the parole board applies wrong criteria or impermissible criteria, then you have a different case."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.465,2310.415,What about all this grace?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2310.415,2312.267,--It is grace.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.267,2316.053,"Well, why would he have any rights under this last question you answered?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2319.857,2328.795,"Well, because even though it is grace, the State gave the grace in the first instance."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.795,2330.178,And the State can take it away?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2330.178,2336.248,"As long as they don't deprive him of anything, they can; yes."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.882,2340.034,Such as due process?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2340.034,2342.402,Due process or anything else.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.888,2347.721,"Oh, ex post facto."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2347.721,2352.607,Then they can't deprive him of it by saying we're going to withdraw the parole statute.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.607,2363.815,"No, Mr. Attorney General, I just want to know what articles of the Constitution do not apply to ""grace"" matters?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2363.815,2371.688,"All of the Constitution applies, I'm sure, as you well know, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.688,2373.038,I'm not worried about what I know.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2376.057,2384.913,"Yes, sir, the procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, that does apply to grace, absolutely it does."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.12,2404.076,"Well, was this man with four days a month withdrawn?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2404.076,2404.559,Yes.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.472,2430.457,"Well, suppose I look at that plus the reply brief of the petitioner?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2430.457,2433.495,"Well, I hope you'll read mine too."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.419,2452.123,"I said, all of what you said, plus that."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2452.123,2479.54,"Fine, but it's my argument, and I haven't yet been able to get it out, that by addition, by virtue of additional provisions contained in the new statute, that the man has a right to earn a greater amount of gain time under the new statute than he had under the old."
1980.79-5780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2485.944,2487.046,"But counsel, I come back again."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2490.682,2491.482,Yes.
1980.79-5780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2492.534,2496.236,In other words you would not be here if they were not present in your statute?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2496.236,2500.72,I would not be here making the same argument that I am.
1980.79-5780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2502.239,2503.789,"Well, I wonder why you make this concession?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2503.789,2504.591,Sir?
1980.79-5780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2504.591,2507.476,I wonder why you make this concession.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2516.549,2522.819,"It may be in theory, but as a matter of fact, I'm afraid it would be not."
1980.79-5780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2547.601,2557.19,"Well, in essence, isn't your argument that all that lies ahead after the change in the statute was an expectation on which he may not rely?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2557.19,2561.694,That's all he has in support of his argument here.
1980.79-5780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.73,2653.471,Can I just ask you one of the... an admittedly extreme example so that I at least understand what your argument or charge is.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2683.741,2685.974,"Yes, it would, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.709,2697.93,"Let's modify that just to this... supposing the statute said, your sentence shall be from one to 15 years and the warden, depending on how you behave in prison, shall decide when you get out, within that range."
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2717.828,2719.18,"I think it would; I think it would, yes."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.18,2720.38,It would be like this case?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2720.38,2728.119,"It would, because that we're dealing with something that is taking place at sentencing."
1980.79-5780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.245,2746.097,Let me just change it a little bit.
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2755.603,2761.523,"I don't know what they'd do in that case at all, I really don't."
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.278,2824.43,Is this man old or ill?
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2824.43,2825.846,--I don't know.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.232,2830.0,"Well, how can you claim that it'll help him?"
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2830.0,2831.884,I'm just pointing out that it could help him.
1980.79-5780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.884,2833.65,If he gets ill or old--
1980.79-5780,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2833.65,2836.602,"Well, it can help him, yes."
1980.79-5780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2897.69,2898.49,"Thank you, counsel."
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,2901.19,2903.642,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.576,2993.799,"Before you do, Mr. MacDonald, apparently there was another change, if I'm not mistaken, between the two laws."
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3008.373,3012.927,"Your Honor, here's the situation on that."
1980.79-5780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3048.014,3049.716,"That's fine... up front in quotations, is it?"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3049.716,3050.3,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.883,3053.068,So in other words you make no point of that?
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3053.068,3053.468,--No sir--
1980.79-5780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3053.468,3053.918,All right.
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3053.918,3054.754,--because there's no change.
1980.79-5780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3054.754,3055.387,That was my only question.
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3055.387,3055.987,"No, sir."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.885,3136.505,"I'm just curious, do you practice criminal law?"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3136.505,3138.524,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.974,3142.576,I'm just curious.
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3146.394,3148.146,The Scafati case?
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.685,3162.637,And you found that... you were looking through.
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3168.041,3169.642,"--We had Westlaw, Your Honor."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.642,3175.046,"--The Westlaw, and you found the district court cases included in Scafati--"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3175.046,3175.513,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.513,3178.548,"--And then went to Westlaw, and it said there, affirmed?"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3178.548,3179.398,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.965,3216.504,"Of course, Scafati didn't... the per curiam affirmance didn't cite any authority, did it?"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3216.504,3217.123,"No, sir."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.89,3219.14,Did the district court?
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3219.14,3221.058,"The district court, indeed it did."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.077,3232.183,"What did the... was Scafati, didn't that come from a state court?"
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3232.183,3234.635,"--No, sir, it came from a three judge district court--"
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.635,3236.068,Three-judge district court.
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3236.068,3242.988,"--enjoining the enforcement of the Massachusetts statute, the opinion written by Circuit Judge Bailey Aldrich."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.34,3248.009,And what did they rely on?
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3248.009,3255.046,"--The chronology was, commission of the offense, sentencing."
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.412,3304.062,Like what?
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3309.1,3309.45,Yes.
1980.79-5780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.45,3311.0,--that hold squarely on this one?
1980.79-5780,2,43073,thomas_c_macdonald_jr,,3311.0,3324.709,"I think Lindsey does, and I think then one must go back to the more generalized pronouncements which take us back to Kring, Cummings, and all the way back to Calder, as to the nature of punishment."
1980.79-5780,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3336.667,3337.317,"Thank you, gentlemen."
