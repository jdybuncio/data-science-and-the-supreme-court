1983.82-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.039,We'll hear arguments next in Helicopteros Nacionales against Hall.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,19.645,23.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.014,184.936,"Mr. Whalen, why were Bell Helicopter Company and Williams-Sedco-Horn granted instructed verdicts?"
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,184.936,195.577,"The Plaintiff failed to establish any proof of negligence against either of those defendants, and the court dismissed the case against both of those defendants."
1983.82-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,195.577,200.731,"Mr. Whalen, was the underlying cause of action based on pilot error?"
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,200.731,203.683,"Yes, Your Honor, against my client."
1983.82-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,203.683,208.885,Was the pilot of the helicopter involved trained in Texas?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,208.885,210.17,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,224.245,227.279,Was the helicopter itself purchased in Texas?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,227.279,229.996,"The helicopter was purchased in Texas, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,229.996,234.6,Do you not regard both of those as contacts with Texas on the part of your client?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,234.6,235.366,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.431,288.585,Unless we regard the training in Texas and the purchase of the helicopter there as bearing on that.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,288.585,311.516,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that there was no connection and would also suggest that the Supreme Court of Texas among other things ruled that there was no connection between the cause of action and the contacts in Texas, and this is the position which I do not believe my adversary contests."
1983.82-1127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.129,370.055,"Mr. Whalen, I suppose if the facts were exactly the way they were except that the accident had taken place while they were flying over Texas there would be no question they had jurisdiction to sue Helicol for that particular accident."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,370.055,402.36,"There is no question that Helicol under the ruling of this Court, International Shoe, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the court because the pilot error and negligence as well as the resulting injury occurred in Texas and that there were other minimum contacts as well, the contract discussion, for example, and perhaps in those cases in those instances the purchases of equipment could be a basis of additional minimal contacts to support--"
1983.82-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,402.36,410.216,Would there be any difference if there were an adequate showing that the training itself caused the accident?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,417.203,418.586,"--No, Your Honor, I would suggest not."
1983.82-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.586,419.422,Would that make a difference?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,419.422,424.357,It would make no difference because the cause of action arose in Peru.
1983.82-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,427.476,441.668,"Suppose he was trained if he turns to the left he should boot it to the right, and that is what wrecked the plane and everybody in the world agrees that that was wrong."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,441.668,443.02,"Well, his--"
1983.82-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.02,445.639,And he was taught that in Texas.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,445.639,446.722,"--Well, if he was--"
1983.82-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.722,448.674,It is your position that that has nothing to do with it.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,448.674,457.613,"--If he was improperly taught by Bell Helicopter then, of course, Bell helicopter stands to be liable."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.562,495.303,"Mr. Whalen, if the suit had been brought in Peru could Bell Helicopter and Williams-Sedco-Horn have been sued in Peru--"
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,495.303,495.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.886,496.819,--It had jurisdiction in your view?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,496.819,497.586,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,603.071,612.594,"Mr. Whalen, do you rely at all on the contract provision that provides for jurisdiction of disputes in Peru?"
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,612.594,613.963,"--No, Your Honor, I do not."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.198,658.492,"Well, if the contract provision means what it says and if you were to rely on it I suppose the contract was entered into in a sense in Texas and that might give Texas jurisdiction."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,658.492,666.412,"--If I may, Your Honor, the contract was not entered into in Texas."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.331,700.819,So you would like to forget all about the contract provision at least for purposes of this argument in this case?
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,700.819,708.858,"Yes, Your Honor, for the purposes of the jurisdiction of these Plaintiffs against this Defendant on the Plaintiffs' cause of action."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,914.191,936.723,"Mr. Whalen, are there any circumstances in which a purchaser or a buyer of goods in the forum state would be sufficient simply because of the quantity purchased, let's say, or the frequency of that occasion to provide general jurisdiction over that buyer?"
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,936.723,939.425,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.487,1019.127,I am not sure that that distinction alters the relationship of Texas with the buyer though.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1019.127,1021.745,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.462,1052.181,"Well, if the purpose of the inquiry is to determine the extent of contacts with the State of Texas in this case the forum state for the purpose of inquiring what interest the state of Texas would have and the degree to which Texas, for instance, might want to consider the interests of the buyer I would think it would not make such difference why the buyer planned to buy the goods."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1052.181,1092.341,"But the cause of action, Your Honor, was based upon that purchase, and I would agree with you that that would be a contact on which jurisdiction would be based against Helicol, that is, if Helicol failed to pay for its equipment and Bell wanted to sue Helicol for its failure then I believe that Helicol plus other contacts... Those purchases plus other contacts would form a basis for jurisdiction because the cause of action arose out of those contacts."
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.543,1107.768,"Well, suppose Helicol was doing business and it qualified to do business in Texas, the kind of business it does."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1113.255,1114.055,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.055,1132.8,Suppose it was qualified to do business in Texas on that basis but suppose that it was also in business in Peru and on the side it was in the real estate business and it borrowed some money to buy some real estate and did not pay the note.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1135.602,1139.406,"On your facts, Your Honor, yes it could because I think the first point that--"
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.406,1144.774,That would not have arisen out of any of the business they did in Texas.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1144.774,1146.726,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.38,1159.051,"It was, but not a real estate... The only business it ever did in Texas was the transportation business."
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1159.051,1160.751,--I would interpret--
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.751,1162.336,You think that is general jurisdiction.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1164.336,1202.061,"--I think if it consents if it files with the state and says I want to do business in this state I in effect consent to the general jurisdiction and I recognize that the case that the amicus brief, not the United States, the other brief, has contested this point, but my view is that if a company files with a state asking for authority to do business I believe under one of the older Supreme Court decisions that he has consented to jurisdiction, and I would consider that a consent to be sued on any cause of action."
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.061,1211.666,But just a purchaser of a helicopter who does business in Peru... He buys a helicopter in Texas.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1219.755,1220.905,That is right.
1983.82-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.374,1226.243,Which you say is like this case.
1983.82-1127,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1226.243,1227.111,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.599,1239.253,Mr. Pletcher.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1239.253,1243.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.132,1441.734,"Mr. Pletcher, were any of the Plaintiffs domiciled in Texas?"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1441.734,1445.971,"No, Your Honor, not one of them, none of the decedents nor any of their families."
1983.82-1127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.788,1506.342,Even though one of their domiciliaries had been killed as a result of the claimed negligence?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1506.342,1521.102,"I think that this Court's decisions have repeatedly reaffirmed, Your Honor, that unless there be minimum contacts then nothing else matters, that it simply--"
1983.82-1127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.102,1527.173,"I suppose in Volkswagen the Plaintiff was clearly resident of Oklahoma, but that was really all that was going--"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1527.173,1528.958,"--Yes, sir, that is all there was in Volkswagen."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.98,1550.121,"--Well, your position I take it is that it does not make any difference what kind of a cause of action that is being pressed against the helicopter company as long as it has these minimum contacts in Texas."
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1550.121,1550.971,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.426,1602.856,"Well, would you say that... Suppose some United States company sold the helicopter company some gasoline to be delivered in Peru and the helicopter company did not pay its bills."
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1610.693,1611.043,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.215,1627.019,"Yes, but the United States company selling the gasoline had absolutely nothing to do with Texas."
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1627.019,1628.221,I am sorry.
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.421,1632.089,It shipped the... It is from California.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1638.593,1639.195,"--No, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.782,1649.551,So you think the focal point is whether they can sue any place else?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1649.551,1658.24,"--Well, if they could sue any place else, that is, the situation in my case here is that there is no place else in the United States--"
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.24,1658.924,Except Peru.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1658.924,1660.526,--Except Peru or Colombia.
1983.82-1127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1660.526,1666.946,"Mr. Pletcher, you said that there is no issue here of minimum contacts that they conceded?"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1666.946,1681.455,"I think, Your Honor, that they conceded except insofar as the quality and the quantity and the importance of those contacts, but that the contacts exist I think is--"
1983.82-1127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1681.455,1682.622,"Would you summarize them, Mr Pletcher?"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1682.622,1683.255,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1702.019,1702.886,Including the pilot of this plane?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1702.886,1703.386,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.475,1800.432,"Mr. Pletcher, is that negotiation of the contract which was the source of the business they did in Peru really any different from the purchase of the helicopters themselves?"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1818.811,1820.113,"Well, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.113,1824.465,Are you asking us to overrule that case I guess is the bottom line of my question?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1824.465,1826.017,--Am I asking you to--
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.017,1827.534,Overrule the Rosenberg case.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1827.534,1827.984,"--No, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.827,1871.879,"Well, would you think you had enough if there was nothing in the case except the purchase of the helicopters?"
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1871.879,1882.834,--I certainly would not have enough in the case if counsel persuades this Court to ignore purchases as he requests.
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.834,1889.404,My problem is you have got purchases plus training plus the negotiation of the contract that enable you to do business.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1889.404,1890.006,Yes.
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.006,1893.725,I am not sure any one of those is different from the other two analytically.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1895.058,1906.95,"Well, they are different only to the extent that one is frank purchase of goods and the other is a negotiation of a contract to perform services."
1983.82-1127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1906.95,1916.407,Do you put great weight on the fact that they purchased 80 percent of their flying equipment in Houston?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1916.407,1917.707,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.707,1920.692,How many planes was that?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1920.692,1924.577,I believe they bought five helicopters in Fort Worth.
1983.82-1127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1924.577,1927.612,You said 80 percent you think it is a number don't you?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1931.731,1937.135,"Well, because the percentage was the word that was given by Helicol."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.539,1948.609,Do you think your opponent concedes that... I should have asked him.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1958.982,1963.017,"I do not know if he would concede it, but he should concede it, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.135,1966.154,"Well, I know you think he should concede your case."
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1966.154,1974.741,--Bell certainly would be entitled to sue for the failure of Helicol to pay for their helicopters.
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.741,1977.61,Based on minimum contacts.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1977.61,1982.014,"Yes, sir, based on minimum contacts and arising out of the transaction."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.014,1991.686,You think it is a prevailing law that if you purchased goods in a state if that is the only thing you do in a state purchasing from abroad you can be sued in that state for the purchase price.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1994.019,1994.452,"No, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.321,1996.738,The cases are split.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,1996.738,1997.188,--Yes.
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.642,2006.26,A fortiori there would be a big split on this one?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2006.26,2008.426,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.426,2010.562,Do you have some cases that support you?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2010.562,2014.764,"Well, Your Honor, I have basically the Perkins case."
1983.82-1127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2038.981,2040.697,Is Perkins relied on below?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2040.697,2042.183,"Oh, yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.533,2126.003,So you... Just any cause of action that might exist against the helicopter company could be brought in Texas?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2126.003,2129.639,"Only if it is fair and reasonable to do so, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.793,2150.302,"Well, a resident of Ohio buys some stock in the helicopter company and the company is not doing very well and they think the directors are guilty of fraud or something so they want to bring a derivative suit."
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2163.462,2164.745,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.834,2175.334,You mean on these very facts of yours you think that suit would lie?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2175.334,2175.952,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.886,2410.904,May I ask... I take it the pilot was not a defendant.
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2410.904,2412.023,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.023,2413.64,The pilot was not a defendant?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2413.64,2415.058,The pilot was not.
1983.82-1127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.575,2418.408,His estate was not named?
1983.82-1127,1,25938,george_e_pletcher,,2418.408,2420.125,--No.
1983.82-1127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2441.355,2441.938,Very well.
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2444.222,2446.158,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.486,2670.588,"Mr. Whalen, if there were kind of a world-wide due process clause administered perhaps by the World Court of the Hague and that court had decided a world International Shoe case talking about minimum contacts for a country certainly somewhere in the United States should qualify as minimum contacts to adjudicate this dispute don't you think?"
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2670.588,2671.321,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.063,2689.132,"Well, it did not arise but all the plaintiffs reside in the United States."
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2709.96,2711.479,"Your Honor,--"
1983.82-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2711.479,2715.097,One does not decide on those feelings.
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2715.897,2728.655,--The constitutional due process which is the argument I am proposing to this Court is the due process which should be accorded to this Defendant.
1983.82-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.033,2825.585,"Mr. Whalen, let me ask the question I think you have not answered."
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2839.343,2847.832,"--Your Honor, on those facts alone I would state they could not sue."
1983.82-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.832,2854.053,Even though the cause of action arose out of the activity in Texas which would be unlike this?
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2854.053,2860.825,I understand Mr. Justice White's dissent to a denial of certiorari in the Lakeside case.
1983.82-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.383,2874.233,Let me change it.
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2889.476,2891.678,--That is pretty close to the same.
1983.82-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.457,2941.96,"No, but it arose out of a commercial relationship in my hypothetical which is an unsatisfied debt and so forth."
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2943.062,2944.562,"--I think it is a close question, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.697,2949.883,Anyway that is a different case.
1983.82-1127,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,2949.883,2951.316,"--It is a different case, Your Honor."
1983.82-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2973.515,2974.865,"Thank you, gentlemen."
