2006.05-1629,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.237,We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus Duenas-Alvarez.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,9.956,13.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,98.914,101.366,Will you help me out on one mechanical point?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,138.824,140.357,I... I don't think it is.
2006.05-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,140.741,142.776,"Otherwise, you wouldn't have this problem."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,142.776,152.464,"--Well, it is the case that the aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what is sometimes called the target crime."
2006.05-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.51,185.569,"But in any case in my example of... of theft, and the further offense under natural and probable consequences being assault, the only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted would be a charge of theft; is that correct?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,185.569,186.221,It could be.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.099,205.666,I don't understand it.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,217.207,218.207,"No, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.811,224.228,"Okay, well I thought you... I thought you answered--"
2006.05-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.228,224.629,Me too.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,224.629,225.996,I didn't mean to say that.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.645,260.019,--The theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,260.019,261.986,That's the basic principle.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.986,273.577,"Mr. Himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,298.911,307.25,We think that the aiding and betting argument that respondent raises is fairly included within the question presented and that it should be resolved.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.141,321.591,"But it wasn't discussed by the Ninth Circuit, was it?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,321.591,331.699,"--It wasn't, Justice Ginsburg, but it bears upon the question of what it means to say that an aggravated felony encompasses aiding and abetting."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.834,389.82,And what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth Circuit?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,389.82,390.754,"Well, certainly the--"
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.754,392.304,Do we remand for those or what?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,392.304,392.806,--Yes.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.849,411.151,Why would it have to be raised in the Ninth Circuit?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,424.642,425.644,--That's true.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.68,467.838,"Mr. Himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,482.93,483.464,Of course.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.464,488.318,The respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,488.318,488.718,Of course.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.718,491.186,So we can reach those other issues if we wish.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,491.186,493.555,It's ultimately a matter of the Court's discretion.
2006.05-1629,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,504.594,516.837,"Well, the only thing that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a theft offense in California is broader than the generic definition of theft."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,529.395,533.78,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't read the Ninth Circuit's order that way."
2006.05-1629,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.43,654.642,"Counsel, you're ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question, but I take it your rationale for not reaching these other grounds would also apply to your argument that whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the charging documents."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,657.244,658.863,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1629,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,721.703,733.011,What if a particular jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally different theory of aiding and abetting?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,736.213,751.973,"--Well, Justice Alito, we think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to leave open the question that if at some point in the future, some entirely novel radical far-reaching theory of aiding and abetting were adopted, that would not be sufficient."
2006.05-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.921,784.094,"Mr. Himmelfarb, what about accessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that argument as well?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,784.094,788.331,"--Well, we think that that's not fairly included within the question presented."
2006.05-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.55,797.103,"Well, it may not be fairly included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument asserted to defend the judgment."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,797.103,798.303,--That's right.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.235,852.904,How do we know that?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,864.412,873.15,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it tracks the language of the statute up to the point where the statute uses the phrase I just read."
2006.05-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,900.751,908.107,"But to accept your answer, we've got to look into a question of California pleading law which hasn't been passed on below."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,908.107,909.191,"Well, that's right."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.87,951.767,"Why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,971.631,973.299,That would be narrower ground.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,980.303,986.357,"Even though that position has been widely criticized, I think."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,991.427,1025.332,"There has been some criticism of the rule, Justice Ginsburg, but it is applied in criminal cases in Federal courts; and whatever criticism there might be in the academic literature, even in some state decisions, we think it is just inconceivable that Congress would have intended that somebody could be convicted under this theory under the Federal criminal law and be subject to the same criminal penalties as a principal, and yet under the federal immigration law could not be subject to the same immigration consequences as a principal."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.861,1109.605,"In that former question as to whether California theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1128.083,1131.101,"Well, we think that... we don't, first of all."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.442,1253.798,"So you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1253.798,1254.249,--That's right.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.406,1322.894,"Mr. Himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this California statute."
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1342.605,1360.233,"Well, the theft offense that covers cars under than this one in California that I'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg, is just a grand theft statute, which is just general theft as applied to particular circumstances, one of which is the theft of a--"
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.035,1364.487,"That's mentioned in what, 487(d)?"
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1364.487,1365.037,That's right.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.083,1410.416,It covers joyriding?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1410.416,1419.64,"Well, it would cover... it would cover what is colloquially known as joyriding if it fell within the terms of the statute."
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1425.461,1426.877,Temporarily.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1426.877,1429.579,--At least temporarily.
2006.05-1629,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1499.925,1500.959,But in California they would?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1504.377,1504.794,No.
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.506,1524.625,Is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1524.625,1525.641,"The sentence given, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.641,1526.793,Given.
2006.05-1629,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1526.793,1527.577,I'd like to reserve the--
2006.05-1629,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.527,1530.229,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1542.852,1546.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.36,1614.115,Your friend began his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1615.015,1619.083,We do defend the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1619.083,1626.423,"I know the judgment, but you focused at least primarily on other grounds than the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1636.612,1649.888,"As an abstract general matter divorced from the facts of this case and divorced from California law, we agree that aiding and abetting liability is part of a generic definition of any crime, including the theft offense here."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.356,1680.141,Could I ask a factual question?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1717.414,1727.039,"I don't know the answer to the question except to state that those two, those convictions did happen in the years that you state and he did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.376,1737.478,He's not a joyrider anyway.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1737.478,1739.097,I would disagree with that.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.366,1785.827,"So then the Ninth Circuit was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft as the taking or exercising control over property without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent or total?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1786.76,1787.727,"--No, I don't think they're wrong."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.727,1788.779,"Well then, I don't see how you make--"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1788.779,1789.279,Sure.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.912,1791.512,--Isn't that inconsistent with what you just said?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1791.512,1791.947,--No.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.947,1792.397,Why not?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1792.397,1793.281,"No, it's not inconsistent."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.501,1823.951,"I don't understand how that could be right, though."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1837.51,1841.212,The question has to do with how long of the taking.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.914,1859.709,"They're trying to... is there a common law, because they're trying to report... is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule that says if you take somebody else's property for a couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for several hours or several days it is theft?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1859.709,1865.428,"--There is a generic rule on this, and there is a consensus among the vast majority of States."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.893,1892.68,"You shouldn't steal it for an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable amount of time?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1892.68,1894.43,Excuse me.
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.43,1899.684,I don't understand the concept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of time.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1899.684,1904.738,"Well, I mean, that goes to the exact point, Justice Scalia, because we're not... the question is what is stealing."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.155,1916.978,You're saying that the rule is something is theft only if you take it long enough to deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1916.978,1918.914,"--Or a reasonable time, or to place--"
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.914,1919.464,"No, no, no."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1937.792,1942.446,--The source is the generic definition as applied in all of the States.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.446,1942.763,"No, no."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1958.489,1958.772,Sure.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1973.049,1975.815,"That was the third reference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1978.534,1979.286,No.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1989.491,1997.914,Would you describe the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence of general law?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1997.914,2002.466,I would say that the Model Penal Code is consistent with the majority view.
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.911,2023.732,"You assert, you assert it's consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on everything."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2026.267,2027.784,I'm not sure what it says about the death penalty.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.834,2032.087,Is that what joyriding is?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2039.824,2043.359,If you abandon the car wherever you happen to be that's not joy riding.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.592,2067.594,What's the joy in that?
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.462,2076.248,The joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2079.132,2085.036,But what we have here is statute that criminalized conduct less serious than car theft.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.943,2121.145,Do you understand that point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2121.145,2121.529,No.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.382,2135.821,"So if we decided on the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did decide this would available to you to argue on remand?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2135.821,2136.171,"Uh, yes."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.171,2138.038,Because you presented it to the Ninth Circuit below.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2138.038,2140.04,"Yes, it would."
2006.05-1629,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.481,2197.895,"Mr. Meade, the Government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2197.895,2200.079,"I have two responses, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1629,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2281.816,2286.37,So wouldn't it odd for this Court to decide that issue of California law?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2286.37,2291.589,"I wouldn't think it would be odd, Justice Alito, because it is so clear."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.751,2325.327,"Of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2325.327,2326.177,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.177,2328.612,Now is that... is it possible?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2330.779,2331.129,I'm sorry.
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.081,2342.437,"Is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2347.491,2348.824,I disagree.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.654,2374.891,"Well, they say you cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are charged as such, and that the documents show he was charged as a principal."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2374.891,2379.212,We disagree with that characterization of the Government as we set forth in our brief.
2006.05-1629,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.418,2395.738,Well how about how... how the defendant was charged in this very case?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2419.789,2430.978,"--This charge is ambiguous as to whether he was charged as a driver and taker, as the principal, or as an accessory after the fact."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.978,2431.511,"No, no, no."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2447.472,2449.308,"Well, this is a question of California law."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.308,2452.426,It is not a question of Cal... it is a question of English.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2452.426,2453.976,"No, I disagree, Your Honor."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.664,2460.58,We're not saying about what needs to be charged.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2470.805,2472.205,"Well, I disagree."
2006.05-1629,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.647,2501.591,"No, but you're... you're saying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in this case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would be open to California to prove that in fact he didn't do any of those things, but was merely an accessory after the fact?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2504.509,2504.943,Yes.
2006.05-1629,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.943,2505.359,Okay.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2507.643,2508.428,Yes.
2006.05-1629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.597,2512.963,Both West and Toro.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2512.963,2513.43,Yes.
2006.05-1629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.953,2528.808,Does any of those cases squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an accessory after the fact on a general indictment like this?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2528.808,2529.841,"No, none of them do."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2542.099,2543.318,"Well, the Government... it is not only that."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2560.211,2568.266,"--Well, we think People v Prado supports our view which is a statute specifically that allows for accessory liability on its face."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.159,2609.776,But what do we do about that?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2666.63,2668.132,"--Of course, I'd be happy to."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.726,2746.715,But the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2747.717,2748.934,--Yes.
2006.05-1629,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2842.963,2848.867,"In order to agree with you on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide two disputed issues of California law?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2865.828,2873.065,"The Court would only need to decide that first question, not the second question."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2893.043,2899.113,Has anyone ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2899.113,2902.315,"I do not know one way or the other, Your Honor."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2917.594,2931.818,"But if no one has ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to construe this charging document which charges him as a principal as actually meaning to charge him as an accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2931.818,2937.488,"Not necessarily, because what we have is a statutory provision that clearly covers accessories after the fact."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.052,2980.517,"Have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2980.517,2981.417,So--
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.417,2983.619,Have you been able to think of one?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2983.619,2984.186,--Sure.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.154,2986.688,"Yes, I am."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2986.688,2989.023,"Yes, and I thank you for that question."
2006.05-1629,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3017.709,3025.446,Are there cases that hold that the natural and probably consequences of purchasing alcohol for a minor could be joyriding?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3025.446,3026.898,We have not found a case on that.
2006.05-1629,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3027.665,3031.6,Or anything else that somebody might do after getting intoxicated?
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.6,3033.552,Partying maybe I would understand.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3036.337,3044.527,"--The natural and probable consequences theory cuts across a wide variety of crimes, as the government points out."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3169.44,3172.792,"Your argument isn't limited to theft offenses, correct?"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3180.446,3181.764,"Yes, it would."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.718,3193.289,It would mean we could not rely on the categorical approach in almost any of those cases?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3193.289,3195.408,"--As... on the first step, yes."
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3195.408,3196.558,"Yeah, the categorical approach."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3196.558,3197.558,"It does mean that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3197.558,3209.065,"Well then, what's an example of where you're held guilty on the ground that you aided and abetted natural and probable... somebody did X and the natural and probable consequence was--"
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3218.937,3219.256,Sure.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.189,3222.558,One would be good enough.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3223.691,3232.647,"If you intend to aid and abet robbery, you intend to aid and abet robbery, you can be held liable for an unintended rape of another."
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.116,3237.318,That's a known and probable consequence?
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3239.318,3239.718,--Yes.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3239.718,3245.472,"Well then, maybe the problem is that they don't define natural and probable consequence properly."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3245.472,3247.507,"Well, this is how it's applied under California law."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3248.574,3249.376,Wait a minute.
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3250.359,3252.244,"--That's a real case, and I'll give you the cite."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.549,3288.834,It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences.
2006.05-1629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3289.734,3292.203,You're asking us to say--
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3319.536,3326.292,"What the Taylor analysis looks to is what's in the heartland of a certain crime, and here what's in the heartland of aiding and abetting."
2006.05-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.428,3343.837,"Let me tell you, what's aberrant is the California interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3353.543,3354.909,Just to briefly respond?
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.909,3355.395,"Yes, sir."
2006.05-1629,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3355.395,3361.382,The rule that you state is that one intends the natural and probable consequences of one's own acts.
2006.05-1629,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.464,3386.78,"Thank you, Mr. Meade."
2006.05-1629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3390.032,3414.814,"Would it be completely inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of potential liability such as proposed by the respondent, which would exonerate him from application of this statute, that he has the burden to show that that's what happened?"
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3414.814,3415.648,"Well, we think--"
2006.05-1629,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3415.648,3419.902,Would Taylor allow us to do that sort of burden shifting?
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3419.902,3429.407,"--Well ultimately, Justice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on the question of what Congress's intent was under the INA."
2006.05-1629,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3465.513,3470.734,And so your general rule to accomplish your objective would be?
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3470.734,3488.529,"It's the one I suggested when I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this Court that Congress intended to include aiding and abetting liability in the aggravated felony provision, and intended to cover whatever formulations were extant in 1988 when the provision was enacted."
2006.05-1629,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3534.408,3547.484,"I think that, the problem I guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense."
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3576.087,3587.525,"Well, even under our fallback position, Justice Souter, under which you would have to come up with some general definition of aiding and abetting and then make a comparison with the law of aiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction."
2006.05-1629,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3630.321,3637.475,Why didn't we simply take the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3637.475,3638.91,"--Well, I... in Taylor?"
2006.05-1629,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3638.91,3639.344,Yes.
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3639.344,3645.481,I think that one of the problems in Taylor was that there really is no Federal definition of burglary.
2006.05-1629,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3661.424,3664.226,Was Taylor an immigration case?
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3664.226,3664.645,"No, it wasn't."
2006.05-1629,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3665.912,3687.908,"So you are in effect, you would say that the rule should be, or the modified Taylor rule for application here should be that it's either got to fall within the concept of the Federal offense, or in default of there being a comparable Federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference to state practice?"
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3687.908,3688.643,May I answer the question?
2006.05-1629,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3688.643,3689.377,Certainly.
2006.05-1629,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3689.377,3698.449,"Our primary submission is that in the context of aiding and abetting, there shouldn't be any generic definition beyond what the states apply, whatever the formulation."
2006.05-1629,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3710.739,3712.221,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
