1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.122,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1838, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Company, and 89-1845, Boureslan v. Arabian American Oil Company."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,17.273,20.803,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.152,219.514,"General Starr, that's the most... you assert that's the most reasonable reading."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,237.796,241.41,--I think that is an exceptionally strained reading of it.
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.586,304.319,"General Starr, let's grant that that is a strained reading."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,332.699,348.418,"I don't think it's strained at all, because for one thing, we have guidance from what Congress was getting at, especially in the history of this provision, that it was getting at discrimination by U.S. employers."
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.519,353.011,I'm not saying this provision is strained.
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,390.805,409.92,"--I don't think, in response to your question, that the Court should engage in a clear statement form of analysis that it has done in the Eleventh Amendment setting, in tribal sovereign immunity settings, in... in the law of preemption to require a clear and unambiguous statement."
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.601,557.185,"General Starr, we, we could have held in that case simply it doesn't apply to foreign nationals."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,574.196,574.626,--But when we look--
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.626,576.299,You want us to read it not that way.
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,579.802,597.093,"--The exception, however, is one with respect to foreign employers that is powerfully suggested by the history of this provision and the way this Court has historically gone about the analysis of broadly worded statutes against the backdrop of conflicts of law."
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.158,682.367,"General Starr, the more of these unexpressed exceptions you have to read into the statute to make it work, the less it strikes me as clear, which our opinions say it has to be, that the statute is meant to have extraterritorial application."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,712.048,713.898,"No, because of the supremacy clause."
1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.77,799.033,"General Starr, Foley Brothers involved an American employer and an American citizen, didn't it?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,799.033,799.764,It did.
1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.764,803.607,And you say that's different because the statute was written differently?
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,803.607,820.888,"It is different because when we look at what Foley Brothers... the analysis of the Court in Foley Brothers, the statement of the canon of construction is is there... the presumption is it applies only domestically unless a contrary intent appears."
1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.315,863.818,"Is there any statutory definition of the word ""state"" in the act?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,863.818,865.618,"There is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.158,893.106,"So they... the way they define ""state"", the alien exemption, saying employment of aliens outside any ""state"", would mean outside of any State or territory, basically."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,893.106,893.425,That is correct.
1990.89-1838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.425,896.797,"Well, what about, say, the American Embassy in Paris?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,904.354,906.164,I think that's right.
1990.89-1838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,908.034,921.604,"And that would... that would make the exemption have some sense, because it would mean that, I take it an American citizen would be protected by the act in the American Embassy, but that an alien would not be?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,921.604,922.523,--That is correct.
1990.89-1838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.009,983.545,"But incidentally, Mr. Starr, my example of the coverage of the American Embassy would pertain under both your and the respondents' analysis of the statute, would it not?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,987.548,989.639,--Because of the United States being--
1990.89-1838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,989.639,992.091,--would be given under ARAMCO's interpretation of the statute?
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,992.091,1000.766,"--It may, except ARAMCO's reading, and it will speak for itself, as I understand it, is no extraterritorial reach."
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.482,1079.266,"General Starr, we said in Benz that for us, that is this Court, to run interference in such a delicate field of international relations, that is to interpret the statute to apply abroad, there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1101.692,1110.528,"I have to, with all respect, quarrel with your reading out of the commerce definition, foreign commerce, by virtue of the magic words not being there."
1990.89-1838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.144,1145.861,"Well, the definition includes trade among the several States or between the State and any place outside?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1145.861,1146.612,--Exactly.
1990.89-1838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.908,1256.472,"General Starr, can I just ask this question on the definition with respect to Justice White's question, commerce between a foreign nation and any State."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1266.369,1279.819,"That employer may well... Wickard v. Filburn, broad definitions of commerce, but I think that would raise a serious question as to whether that entity is involved in U.S. commerce, including the foreign commerce of the United States."
1990.89-1838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.819,1280.468,Okay.
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1280.468,1281.38,There certainly would be an argument.
1990.89-1838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.384,1326.269,"General Starr, this is a law applicable only to United States citizens only because you say it is a law applicable only to United States citizens."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1354.166,1361.632,--Let me not beg the question by saying this law applies abroad in our reading of the statute for these reasons.
1990.89-1838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1386.146,1389.749,But of course that sweeps in the foreign employer as well.
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1393.211,1397.944,--My basic message is leave that sticky question to another day.
1990.89-1838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.677,1403.688,"Well, but I think it has to be in our minds as we resolve this one."
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1403.688,1407.441,--I'm not suggesting that it should not be in the Court's mind.
1990.89-1838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.863,1446.587,"That's true, but the problem is that the language of the statute itself doesn't produce that result, does it?"
1990.89-1838,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1446.587,1454.351,"--It does not, and when this Court has historically faced that question it has looked to the backdrop of conflicts of law."
1990.89-1838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.948,1511.089,"Very well, General Starr."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1512.771,1519.824,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1838,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.699,1859.085,"Well, I... you argue that the... there has to be a congressional intent to apply it extraterritorially that is clear and affirmatively expressed."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1892.619,1898.601,"Well, Justice O'Connor, if I may, I'd like to deal with the presumption and Steele somewhat separately."
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.57,2089.717,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Friedman, that there is some reason why securities acts as a class, or the Lanham Act should apply, and the statute like Title VII shouldn't?"
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2089.717,2091.279,There are a number of reasons.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.096,2184.548,"Yes, but that is because the statute is not narrowly limited to engaged in commerce."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2186.859,2188.371,--In this statute?
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.491,2189.952,--Yes.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2193.474,2205.142,"Well, everyone would be covered by the act, unless, of course, one assumes and presumes that Congress doesn't legislate beyond its borders unless it says it's doing so."
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.142,2220.623,"No, but what I meant to say is that the reference to commerce in statutes like the Sherman Act and all, limits... is a limiting provision if the... if you added words here it shall be unlawful employment practice for an employer when in commerce, or something, that would tend to limit the scope of it rather than broaden it."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2225.945,2226.776,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.776,2230.988,I may not have quite understood the thrust of your argument.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2230.988,2233.419,--I think you did understand the thrust of my argument.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.366,2263.259,"Of course, I suppose their response is you really have to read that definitional provision together with the exemption, the alien exemption."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2263.259,2264.17,"Well, I think--"
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.17,2267.272,"And I'm not sure they're entirely independent of one another, which is sort of what you're arguing."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2267.272,2288.858,"--I'm not going to make the Solicitor General's argument for him, but I did suggest, and I think I'm right, that it has changed and shifted from time to time, both in this Court and in the lower courts as to whether the exemption provides coverage by a negative inference, by exempting aliens therefore it applies to U.S. citizens, or whether the commerce language provides coverage and then the exemption withdraws it."
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.121,2297.684,"No, normally we read the entire statute and try and figure out what Congress meant."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2297.684,2298.613,--That's right.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.613,2299.324,We read it all together.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2299.324,2305.748,"And I think if you, if you read the entire statute and try to figure out what commerce meant here, it's a difficult task."
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.26,2374.484,"What is that explanation, Mr. Friedman?"
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2374.484,2388.351,--It is an explanation which really turns on an effort by Congress to overrule this Court's decision in Vermilya-Brown.
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.486,2432.7,What was the problem of Vermilya-Brown that Congress was trying to avoid with this exception?
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2432.7,2441.606,"--Congress... the Court said that leased bases and military bases are possessions, and that therefore--"
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.606,2444.168,Even though they were located in foreign countries.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2444.168,2446.339,--Even though they were located in foreign countries they were possessions.
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.255,2548.598,Is there legislative history in connection with the '64 act?
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2548.598,2549.456,None.
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2549.456,2550.197,--that shows.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2557.773,2562.325,All we know is that in '49 Congressman Powell introduced it and there were various statutes.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.7,2604.954,"May I ask this, Mr. Friedman?"
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2619.973,2621.244,That's correct.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.472,2633.872,Right.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2633.872,2640.327,And the other was to deal expressly with the problem of aliens and the problem of... that foreign governments suggested--
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.327,2646.879,But that's dealing with the problem of aliens in territories or geographic locations where there was unquestioned Federal jurisdiction.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2646.879,2648.982,--I think it's... I think it's both.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.982,2649.852,I see.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2649.852,2673.777,"I think it's both, because, again if you look at the, for example, the dissenting opinion in... I forget, the concurring opinion in Foley Brothers by Justice Frankfurter and Justice Reed, who were trying to relitigate Vermilya-Brown, if I might say so, at that point, they were, they were discussing the reactions that we got from foreign governments and from the Defense Department and others that--"
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.777,2678.812,"And they also relied heavily on letters from different parts of the executive branch of our Government, too."
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2678.812,2679.29,--They did.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.29,2681.103,But you don't have any such support in this case.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2681.103,2683.084,"Well, the Solicitor General is here."
1990.89-1838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.434,2859.429,"Mr. Friedman, what about the deference we normally accord to the agency that is charged with implementing the act?"
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2874.578,2881.654,"Well, their call... and maybe we should use the word plural, calls... their call has changed dramatically over the years."
1990.89-1838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.353,2961.717,You don't think we should give them deference here?
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2961.717,2963.487,"No, actually I don't, Your Honor."
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.188,2969.35,"No, you say we give them the same deference we gave them in the General Electric case?"
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2969.35,2969.881,Exactly.
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.881,2970.302,Yeah.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,2971.153,2985.893,"In the end, in the end the question of whether this was good policy... what what the Solicitor General argues was good policy in 1964 was a question for Congress, and we say they didn't do it."
1990.89-1838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.979,3015.512,Of course fresh looks at this statute are very time consuming over there.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3015.512,3018.585,"They're very time consuming over there, that's true."
1990.89-1838,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3023.567,3035.235,I guess there isn't much question that the present Congress has been under the impression that it applies to U.S. employers of U.S. citizens overseas.
1990.89-1838,1,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3035.235,3039.979,I... whether... there's not much question that Senator Grassley thought it applied.
1990.89-1838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.534,3095.495,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3097.047,3099.799,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1838,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.137,3236.667,"But General Starr, I'm not sure I have the various language in mind, but I think the argument ran that during that fixing up of Vermilya-Brown they adopted language which was much like this, and the pattern, you just assume that when they copied language which was used previously it may have had the same purpose."
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3238.059,3244.192,"--I think that is... that there may have been some lingering problem, but to the extent there was a congressional problem, Vermilya-Brown handled it."
1990.89-1838,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.294,3264.175,What do you mean it supports?
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3264.175,3267.308,--Our reading of the statute with respect--
1990.89-1838,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.308,3272.611,"Well, it's just... the legislative history just doesn't challenge your view, that's all."
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3280.484,3281.546,"--Yes, at page... it is."
1990.89-1838,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.353,3307.183,What is an authoritative memorandum?
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3313.578,3326.105,--This Court in Stotts said specifically that this Court has on two prior occasions recognized the authoritative nature of this memorandum with respect to the meaning of Title VII.
1990.89-1838,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.105,3326.666,Oh.
1990.89-1838,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3329.398,3330.008,On three occasions.
1990.89-1838,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.942,3337.236,"Thank you, General Starr."
