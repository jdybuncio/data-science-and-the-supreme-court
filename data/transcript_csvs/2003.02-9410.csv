2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.052,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-9410, Michael D. Crawford v. Washington."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,57.547,62.953,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.344,90.279,"When you say out-of-court testimony, Mr. Fisher, what do you mean by the word testimony?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,90.279,103.82,"What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice, is someone giving a statement out of court that is the functional equivalent of what they would do in court, which is to say they're giving the authorities a statement that is describing an event in a way that they understand is going to be used in a criminal investigation."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.82,110.507,So it may... it... the... it applies to the... if it's made to the authorities but not to a third person?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,110.507,113.358,Ordinarily that's the... that would be the dividing line.
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.358,113.896,Why is that?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,113.896,120.5,"Well, because the Confrontation Clause, to go back to the text and to start with the text, talks about being a witness against somebody."
2003.02-9410,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,136.764,144.816,But your ultimate criterion is was it made with the understanding that it would or probably be used for prosecutorial purposes.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,144.816,148.175,That's the way I read the... the term witness against in the Constitution.
2003.02-9410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.776,154.369,"So in an auto accident, a private investigator... it's a serious accident."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,161.561,162.626,The private--
2003.02-9410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.626,164.233,It's a later criminal proceeding and it's--
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,164.233,169.517,"--Well, I mean, I... I think that that's the kind of a statement that ordinarily is not going to be testimonial."
2003.02-9410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.455,180.83,"--Well, it's... it's an auto accident and insurance investigators are all over the scene when it later turns into a criminal case."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,180.83,188.511,"--I mean, that's the kind of a situation that there could be a difficult question in something like that, but I think that is likely not to be testimonial."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.511,188.761,"Well, it's--"
2003.02-9410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.761,191.999,--What about if the... what about a police officer who does the same thing?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,191.999,200.073,"I think the police officer certainly tips the balance and certainly when somebody is talking to a police officer, that's the kind of a statement they understand is going to be used in court."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.073,212.538,"Well, if... if we're going to change, as you suggest in your brief, to using this term testimonial, it certainly does not bring any great certainty, does it, if you say something tips the balance one way or another?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,214.767,220.219,"Well, I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, there are going to be some close cases out on the margins, and I acknowledge that."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.975,255.141,When you--
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,283.022,283.832,"--Well, the--"
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.832,287.669,"I mean, you... you would still have some testimonial statements in there."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,298.321,300.345,"--I don't think, Your Honor, any cases since Roberts."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.345,300.733,No case.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,300.733,302.052,Nor any case before Roberts.
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.052,303.029,Then why change?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,303.029,317.268,"Because the lower courts aren't getting it right, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that the problem is, is that the Roberts approach sets up a framework that is both unworkable in practice and is leading to consistently anomalous results."
2003.02-9410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.261,326.35,Idaho would have... v. Wright would have come out the same way because the doctor who took the statements of the child was acting at the request of the police?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,326.35,328.868,"--That's how I understand the facts of the case, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.93,360.242,But isn't... isn't that our... our function in part?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,370.069,380.609,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, but, you know, I would submit that you're going to have to practically fill your docket with Confrontation Clause cases doing error correction in order to come out correct in all these cases."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.609,386.992,"Well, we've... but we've had Roberts for 23 years, and we certainly haven't filled our docket with Confrontation Clause cases."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,386.992,387.614,"Well, that's right."
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,430.422,433.144,"Before you give the reasons, I... I want to go back to what you said."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,469.803,473.972,"--Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, you don't have to get too far into that in this case because, of course--"
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,473.972,474.222,"No, no."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,483.426,484.353,--I think--
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,484.353,486.461,--so I'm... I'm... I want your opinion on that.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,498.471,503.383,--I think I agree with the starting point of the functional equivalent of testimony.
2003.02-9410,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.212,539.382,"Would there be anything that fit in your category where the person to whom the statement is made is not an officer, either a police officer or prosecutor?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,539.382,546.691,"I think there may be, and the reason... I think there may be a... a rare, rare case, Justice Ginsburg, in a scenario... you know, come up with hypotheticals."
2003.02-9410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.517,558.951,Why... why should it depend on the intent of the declarant?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,584.752,586.693,"--Well, in that--"
2003.02-9410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.693,589.665,Because he would not know that this was going to be used in court.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,589.665,594.661,"--Well, I mean, I think that's a situation... you know, and this is where the definitional problem gets difficult."
2003.02-9410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.046,629.6,"Well, but--"
2003.02-9410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.6,642.769,"--Are you... just... just with the dialogue with Justice Scalia, because I'm interested in the same problem, is it the intent of the speaker or the intent of the person taking the statement that would be... be more relevant in your view?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,642.769,650.532,"Well, certainly I... I... you know, you don't have to decide that question in this case, but I think that if either one of them--"
2003.02-9410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.532,651.154,"Well, of course... of course, we do."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,662.299,662.875,"--I see, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.016,682.071,You mean even the speaker or the person taking the statement.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,685.143,700.83,--I think certainly the speaker and I think there may be situations... and this is... this is something the Court can deal with about when this... about when the... when the governmental officer is the only one and... and is under such a circumstance that the governmental officer is molding the statement in such a way and molding what somebody is going to say--
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,700.83,714.948,"Well, you know, the concern we ought to have with your approach is we're going to get into some very tricky questions if we go your route in deciding what's testimonial, and why buy a pig in a poke, in effect?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,714.948,724.569,"--Well, the first reason is because, as I said, if you have difficult cases out on the margin, I submit to the Court the Constitution could tolerate that."
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.569,726.094,"Yes, but I think the professors there are thinking that isn't difficult."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,769.911,771.769,"No, I'm sorry, Mr.... Justice Breyer."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.799,797.486,It's your view that a co-conspirator statement is not testimonial then?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,797.486,799.716,--I think that's the ordinary course of events.
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.831,804.34,"Well, why is that if it meets the test of a statement made to the police?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,804.34,810.163,"Well, if there's an undercover officer present, it meets... it meets the... the... you know, the test of a statement made to the police."
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.704,815.53,Not... you're right.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,843.766,844.714,I think that's correct.
2003.02-9410,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.714,845.912,And... and--
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.912,848.02,"--Well, how... how about a wire tap?"
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,856.498,860.567,I think that's the traditional kind of co-conspirator statement that is not covered by the testimonial approach.
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,862.303,865.191,And under your approach it would come in without difficulty.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,867.692,870.392,"--Without difficulty as to the Confrontation Clause, yes, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,923.065,931.981,"Well, let's look at this very case and tell me whether the result is any different at the end of the day under Roberts versus your test."
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,931.981,933.922,"I think the answer is absolutely not, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-9410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,950.723,950.99,And therefore?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,965.529,967.98,"--It doesn't matter in this case, Justice O'Connor, for two reasons."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.903,1003.812,Is it--
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1003.812,1004.927,"--you know, is excludable under both tests."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.927,1008.187,--Why is it excludable under your test?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1008.187,1011.864,"Well, under the testimonial approach, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.864,1012.185,Yes.
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1012.185,1022.926,"For the simple reason that she was in custody giving a statement, giving a confession or a... or a custodial examination to police officers knowing it was going to be used in the criminal investigation."
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.695,1029.913,How--
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1029.913,1031.182,It brings us all the way back to Raleigh's trial.
2003.02-9410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.182,1037.953,--How about a statement like in Mancusi or one of those cases where the witness is given prior recorded testimony?
2003.02-9410,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1044.473,1045.672,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1259.682,1264.512,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1284.452,1286.597,"Well, you kind of want it both ways."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1295.719,1297.577,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.152,1326.638,I don't... I don't understand.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1338.156,1339.437,That's correct.
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.437,1357.353,Are there any other provisions that are in the Bill of Rights that are not absolute and can be overcome by proof that the... that the overall purpose of the truth-serving function is... is achieved?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1384.286,1385.839,"No, Justice Scalia, but--"
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.839,1388.068,Then why do we say it about the Confrontation Clause?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1391.373,1393.724,--The Court has said it about the Confrontation Clause--
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.724,1395.089,--I know it has.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1395.089,1396.165,--in a variety of contexts.
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.165,1399.947,And... and the issue here is whether we... we should retreat from those statements.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1399.947,1411.314,"Well, starting from the overall structure of the Sixth Amendment, the Court has construed many of the rights in the Sixth Amendment not to be absolute in certain contexts."
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.49,1434.514,That... that's just a matter of limiting the scope.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1461.635,1476.412,"--What this Court has said about the Confrontation Clause is that it incorporated a preexisting common law right that had common law exceptions with it, and those common law exceptions were capable of growing and being developed along the lines of analogous principles."
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.412,1488.401,Growing and being developed so that the... the guarantee of confrontation is just a guarantee that in the future we'll... we'll leave it there if we think it should be there.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1488.401,1490.447,It's not an absolute guarantee.
2003.02-9410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.06,1567.723,"But then maybe your position is not different from... from theirs in this respect, if you take the law professors'."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1594.844,1595.504,No.
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.271,1598.476,"--No, it certainly isn't."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1604.01,1606.777,We define the underlying purpose of the Confrontation Clause--
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.777,1607.065,To achieve the truth.
2003.02-9410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.43,1608.968,"--Oh, achieve the truth."
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.968,1609.134,Yes.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1609.134,1610.926,--To serve the truth-seeking mission of the--
2003.02-9410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1610.926,1627.255,"Sir Walter Raleigh... if they came in... Sir Walter Raleigh... in fact, it is shown that all the... the statements made out of court against Sir Walter Raleigh were made in front of 12 bishops, and at that time that was a very, very good security that this was completely true."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1637.741,1643.685,--I doubt seriously that... that Sir Walter Raleigh's case would come out differently under our approach.
2003.02-9410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1644.8,1648.432,"In other words, Sir Walter Raleigh... it came out that they did introduce this thing."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1650.184,1654.088,"--The witnesses were available, Justice Breyer, in Walter Raleigh's case."
2003.02-9410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.828,1661.818,--You would overrule Inadi then?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1661.818,1664.369,"Oh, definitely not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1700.899,1702.264,"Well, what about in this case?"
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1705.236,1716.919,--There was no suggestion in the lower courts that these two individuals were attempting to further the conspiracy or that there was a conspiracy going on at the time of the statements.
2003.02-9410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1716.919,1719.314,"Well, I was going to say there was no conspiracy found, was there?"
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1719.314,1724.721,"That's... these... these statements were admitted, Justice Souter and Justice O'Connor, as statements against penal interest."
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.943,1733.432,"And not as a so-called interlocking... well, it was an interlocking--"
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1733.432,1734.009,--Yes.
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.867,1737.148,--type of confession or something.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1737.148,1739.294,--The hearsay basis was statement against penal interests.
2003.02-9410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.8,1756.551,"But the Government doesn't endorse that position, as I understand it."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1756.551,1758.984,"--We do not endorse that position, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-9410,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.984,1761.668,What is your position as to what should have happened with this statement?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1761.668,1764.823,"This statement should have been excluded, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.862,1770.379,Under Roberts--
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1770.379,1771.66,--Under Roberts--
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.66,1771.826,--as well as--
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1771.826,1772.819,--That's correct.
2003.02-9410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.819,1773.207,--this theory.
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1773.207,1789.453,"Under Roberts, as explicated in Idaho v. Wright, corroborating evidence that serves to show the reliability of a particular statement is not an acceptable means of vindicating its admission under the Confrontation Clause."
2003.02-9410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.491,1818.737,"Well, couldn't he be impeached with his out-of-court statement?"
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1818.737,1822.89,--He certainly could and was impeached with his out-of-court statements.
2003.02-9410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.493,1868.094,"But they didn't match, and that's the oddest thing."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1897.816,1900.871,And... and the State made that point in its rebuttal argument.
2003.02-9410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.561,1922.707,"Well, concerns by whom?"
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1922.707,1938.311,Concerns that I think are... are raised by reading the Confrontation Clause as an original matter before this Court's jurisprudence made all hearsay subject to the Confrontation Clause.
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.603,2019.262,Do you think that developing a jurisprudence to decide what constitutes testimonial statements is any more difficult than developing a jurisprudence to determine what are sufficient indicia of reliability to overcome the text of the Confrontation Clause?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2019.262,2020.665,"No, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-9410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.251,2089.087,Why unavailable from another source?
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2112.597,2124.197,"Our position is that with respect to testimonial statements, the preference is to get live, in-court testimony with all of the benefits that the Confrontation Clause envisioned for testimony."
2003.02-9410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.376,2168.037,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2003.02-9410,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2168.037,2168.947,--Thank you--
2003.02-9410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.947,2170.554,"Mr. Sherman, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2170.554,2174.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.816,2226.243,"We could have written it that way, I suppose."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2240.361,2242.135,That's correct--
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.135,2243.044,It doesn't say that.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2248.163,2249.732,"--That... that's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.044,2265.873,"Where... I mean, I don't understand where we derive this permissibility of not allowing him to confront the witnesses against him so long as we come to the judgment that the evidence is inherently reliable."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2265.873,2283.912,"--Well, Your Honor, I guess to answer that question properly, I... I'll speak to what I at least read and heard actually petitioner and in one of the amici briefs concerning the... the history surrounding the Confrontation Clause and how we got to have the right to confrontation."
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.556,2349.549,No.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.549,2350.087,That may be--
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.087,2350.292,--It could be amended.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2360.201,2361.399,--And I would agree.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.635,2381.378,Why?
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2381.378,2388.687,"If you take literally the Confrontation Clause, I believe that it--"
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.687,2391.121,"It says witnesses, confront witnesses."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2395.95,2404.662,--I... I believe that everyone that comes and sits on the witness stand and says anything that is going to be used--
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.662,2412.297,"A typical case that... where it should come in, but I guess under their proposal it would, and under the status quo it probably wouldn't."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2456.979,2459.541,"--Well, I... I respectfully disagree with Your Honor--"
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.541,2460.079,Why?
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2460.079,2462.142,--that it's not a Confrontation Clause question.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.142,2462.308,All right.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2491.864,2492.401,Correct.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.401,2493.804,You have experience in this area.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2550.73,2567.986,"To address the first part of your question, Your Honor, I believe what I was... was attempting to say was that the Confrontation Clause, strictly interpreted, it is going to not let any hearsay of any kind in."
2003.02-9410,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.284,2577.729,You mean the... the only kind of evidence that can become... come in at a criminal trial is from a witness who's physically present in the courtroom.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2577.729,2581.445,"I believe that that would be a strict interpretation of the Confrontation Clause, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.426,2589.784,From your own experience.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2593.417,2594.16,"--Well, actually--"
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.16,2596.101,You work in this area and I'd like you--
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2596.101,2603.903,"--I do and... and I can say from my experience, I have had very few problems arise with Confrontation Clause principles under the Roberts framework."
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2615.874,2617.566,--Do you think this was interlocking?
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2617.566,2618.309,"--I do, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.309,2621.818,"Well, they certainly differed on a key element."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2625.739,2651.624,"And, Your Honor, I... I believe that the court of appeals also, at least the majority of that court, believed that there was a difference between what the... Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were saying, but the... our supreme court looked more closely at the statements and observed that in fact they were saying the same thing."
2003.02-9410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.624,2665.492,"Wasn't the whole point of admitting it that... that she had, in effect, said there... there was no weapon, the victim was not taking a weapon out, and that was on the basis of her statement the prosecutor made exactly that argument?"
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2666.485,2674.203,"No, not specifically that... that she said that he wasn't taking one out because clearly she didn't say that."
2003.02-9410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.192,2679.321,"Well, her description did not include one."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2683.779,2687.494,"--In part, and... and... but his description did not include a... a weapon either."
2003.02-9410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2689.64,2698.928,"No, but the implication of his description was that he reasonably thought something was coming out and he then in one of his statements said, you know, it was him or me."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2715.647,2724.663,"--I believe that that was that prosecutor's interpretation of... of that evidence, and that is in fact what he argued at trial."
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.875,2737.445,After the assault.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2737.445,2740.583,"No, Your Honor, I respectfully--"
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2740.583,2743.184,Why don't we look at this since the testimony is there?
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2744.854,2753.049,"--And... and, Your Honor, as I indicated, so did apparently my deputy prosecutor and so did our court of appeals."
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.219,2764.006,But one of the worrisome things about treating all these things is just hearsay reliability.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2778.312,2785.908,"Well, she did say those things, but she also said things that indicated that that was not quite... quite correct."
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2792.802,2798.457,But she said at that time she had been drinking and she... that happened before.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2813.401,2820.421,"--Well, and... and I understand Your Honor's question and... and position."
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2841.598,2844.736,She did say that she shut her eyes and didn't really watch.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2850.764,2858.482,"--Well, because she at the same... in the same breath was able to accurately describe the same events that Michael had described in his statement."
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.482,2859.531,But that's unreliable.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2866.201,2873.549,And... and I understand Your Honor's position on that.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2880.624,2881.806,--But suppose we said it was unreliable.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2894.703,2895.446,Right.
2003.02-9410,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.446,2895.901,Okay.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,2934.539,2942.507,"I think at... at a certain point the tougher you make the standards for hearsay to come in, the fewer pieces of hearsay that are going to come in."
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.113,3026.97,"--But... but we have said in other cases that the reliability, which... which Roberts insists upon, has to be established from the statement itself and not from other statements."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3028.335,3030.108,Which would seem to exclude interlock--
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.108,3031.389,--Interlocking confessions.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3042.08,3048.646,"And if Roberts were the only case that... that the Court were to look at, that I think would... I would agree that would be the case."
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3090.339,3094.692,I thought Lee involved co-defendants.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3094.692,3102.311,"--Well, I... I believe there... I don't... I don't recall there being co-defendants at trial, and I may be mistaken about that."
2003.02-9410,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3154.323,3162.292,"But the bottom line was that it... that that test was not met in the case, that there wasn't a sufficient interlock."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3162.292,3168.73,"--That... that wasn't met in the Lee case, and that was the decision of the court of appeals in this case."
2003.02-9410,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.552,3184.916,"I thought that what we said in Lee was simply that assuming that an interlocking confession exception exists, this didn't meet it."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3197.548,3200.558,I think perhaps.
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3231.394,3247.907,I thought actually that there were five members of the Court in Lee v. Illinois to say that confessions of a co-defendant are presumptively unreliable for purposes of Roberts.
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3247.907,3248.734,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3248.734,3258.887,"And that even if there was a so-called interlocking confession exception, it wasn't met in that case."
2003.02-9410,2,42061,steven_c_sherman,,3258.887,3263.057,And... and I can understand that interpretation.
2003.02-9410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3270.775,3273.17,"Well, maybe they better re-read it."
2003.02-9410,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3510.838,3512.203,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-9410,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3668.861,3669.687,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
