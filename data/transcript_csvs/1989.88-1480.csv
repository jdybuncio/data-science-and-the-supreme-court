1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,11.29,17.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,122.713,127.338,What was the money raised for?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,128.208,135.223,The money was used both in the day-to-day operation of the Co-Op and to make some capital purchases.
1989.88-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,146.29,153.916,"Do you have any statistics on the number of non-members... percentage of notes that were sold to non-members, as opposed to members?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,153.916,157.797,--There is nothing in the record to delineate the exact division.
1989.88-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.269,167.424,"Anything to indicate that the number of notes sold to non-members was substantial or significant, or any finding like that at all?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,167.424,175.188,"Well, the finding by the court was a general finding that the notes were offered... I'm sorry... sold to the public."
1989.88-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.228,234.818,What was the name of the city in which the Co-Op was located?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,234.818,240.771,"Van Buren, Arkansas, and it had outlets in three cities in Oklahoma."
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.771,241.623,And how did they sell?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,241.623,243.205,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.205,243.863,How did they sell?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,244.574,249.469,People would come to an outlet of the Co-Op.
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,249.469,250.581,--Didn't they advertise?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,250.581,252.12,"Yes, they were advertised."
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.12,256.653,And did they use any kind of an agency to sell them?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,256.653,259.344,"No, they were sold directly by the Co-Op."
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.426,278.487,You can say the people made their own Co-Op directly at the outlet?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,278.487,281.189,"Well, we think not, Your Honor."
1989.88-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.869,298.61,"On their face they were a loan, were they not?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,300.503,305.525,Notes?
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.779,310.521,--you think that.
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,315.893,319.804,--This is an obligation to pay money.
1989.88-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.804,320.375,On demand.
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,320.375,321.346,On demand.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.249,344.401,What's the maturity date of a demand note?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,344.401,347.083,A demand note has no maturity date.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.046,374.762,"Is there a general case law to the effect that a demand note is mature on issuance, in effect?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,374.762,379.303,--No.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.303,383.187,The general field of bills and notes?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,383.187,388.149,A demand note can be presented for payment immediately.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.201,414.045,What do you think the purpose was of the exclusion by Congress of notes with a maturity date of less than nine months?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,414.045,421.211,The purpose of the exclusion was to exclude commercial paper not offered to the public.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.624,440.933,"Well, what if there were a note due and payable in six months that was for investment purposes."
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,440.933,455.102,--We believe that a note offered as an investment and widely sold with a six-month maturity would be a security.
1989.88-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.785,462.207,"Notwithstanding the language in the statute, which is rather clear."
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,462.207,467.221,"--Well, Your Honor, the statute has a couple of things that are pertinent."
1989.88-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.27,500.132,Have the exceptions been construed in the light of that introductory phrase?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,500.132,502.974,Every lower court... federal--
1989.88-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.974,504.096,Has this Court ever done that?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,504.096,507.859,--This Court has not addressed this specifically.
1989.88-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.361,534.636,"Mr. McCambridge, I'm sure that the purpose of this thing was to exclude commercial paper."
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,574.24,577.363,"Well, the first point."
1989.88-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.65,596.327,"Well, isn't it true that on a literal reading even a note with a term, once the term arrives, it becomes a demand note thereafter doesn't it?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,596.327,603.864,--I think that the statute says at the time of issuance and deals with notes with fixed terms.
1989.88-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.771,626.417,"Well, do you want to rest on the proposition that no demand note is covered by the exception so that case-by-case we're going to have to look at demand notes to see if they're investments?"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,626.417,628.84,I don't think a literal reading is the proper reading.
1989.88-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.757,667.233,"Well, to say that you're not going to be literal in one respect where you obviously can't be literal is not to say that you're not going to be literal in any respects, which is what you are urging upon us."
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,667.233,676.06,I am suggesting that the explicit language of the statute requires... Congress' language... requires an examination of context.
1989.88-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.765,868.034,"Mr. McCambridge, can I ask you a factual question--"
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,868.034,868.435,--Yes.
1989.88-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.435,869.176,--that I was a little unclear on?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,898.898,899.286,Yes.
1989.88-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.076,915.007,And that would be either up or down?
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,915.007,915.618,Up or down.
1989.88-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.618,919.762,And that was... that was... because it doesn't really fit the language of the note itself.
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,919.762,920.951,"No, it does not."
1989.88-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.951,921.442,Yeah.
1989.88-1480,0,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,927.276,930.829,"Well, I think that Arthur Young is right on one thing."
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1015.643,1024.719,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.83,1081.888,Would you be arguing the same if there were some bank that was willing to supply working capital to this Co-Op and every month advanced money to them?
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1090.343,1108.054,"--Justice White, if in fact the case were as you posited with just a bank, a single bank, loaning money to the Co-Op to cover operating expenses, in our view, under the Second Circuit's family resemblance test, which we urge this Court to adopt, those notes would not be covered."
1989.88-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.378,1131.73,--But it was still securing its working capital through these notes.
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1131.73,1132.531,Yes.
1989.88-1480,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1167.975,1176.15,"Under that test, what would guide judges in knowing what's on the list of family resemblances?"
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1176.15,1198.505,"--Well, first of all, Justice O'Connor, what is on the list today... the different examples that the Second Circuit has previously put on the list and also, as Judge Friendly made clear in the Chemical Bank case... the examples on the list, in his words, were not graven in stone."
1989.88-1480,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.256,1236.579,"Well, is it just what Congress should have included if it had made a list?"
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1239.291,1243.745,"What stands behind that list are, first of all, the language of the statute."
1989.88-1480,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.473,1264.639,"Well, if the language of the statute is a starting point, then what about the effect of a maturity date of less than nine months?"
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1264.639,1277.256,"The maturity... the statutory exclusion in the '34 act, in our view, as Petitioners mentioned before that statutory exclusion is limited to commercial paper."
1989.88-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.199,1313.78,"Well, why?"
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1327.619,1331.962,"Well, because they said any note, draft, bill of exchange or banker's acceptance."
1989.88-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.889,1347.3,"It's a very strange way to describe it since ""note"" is a generic term."
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1347.3,1361.171,"Well, so are... and, again, so are bill of acceptance or banker's draft, but all... describing the types of instruments that in the early 1930s Congress knew covered commercial paper."
1989.88-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.171,1365.523,"But also, a note covers more than commercial paper."
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1365.523,1366.184,--Yes.
1989.88-1480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.79,1443.184,Maybe not unless you're trying to get a rule that the courts can easily apply.
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1458.575,1459.354,"No, that's not true."
1989.88-1480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.734,1465.688,"What function would it have, because, as you say, you would just look to see if it has a family resemblance and the nine months doesn't matter."
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1465.688,1471.304,"--Under the family resemblance test with cespe a short-term notes, the test would proceed as follows."
1989.88-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.075,1598.169,"So, if something is called a note on its face, it is presumed to be a security?"
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1598.169,1599.259,"Yes, Justice White."
1989.88-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.259,1606.865,And... but then you run to the exclusion... to the exclusion which overcomes that presumption with respect to short-term notes?
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1606.865,1611.968,It changes the presumption that flips the burden back to the party seeking coverage.
1989.88-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.93,1622.704,So he has to prove that in this context the exclusion just doesn't apply?
1989.88-1480,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1622.704,1623.105,Right.
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1632.931,1635.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.971,1697.624,In what context does that question come up?
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1703.228,1706.78,The several Arkansas cases we cite are statute of limitations cases.
1989.88-1480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.374,1714.855,"Well, I don't see how you can have--"
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1714.855,1726.311,"--demand notes as securities, and the courts have determined... and this is a common-law rule... that when something is on demand it matures at the time it's issued."
1989.88-1480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1726.311,1738.039,"--I thought that... maybe it's just my California experience, but I had thought the rule was just the opposite, that the statute of limitations begins to run from the time a demand is made."
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1738.039,1749.236,"At least not in Arkansas and, as we understand, the general... I don't know what, Justice Kennedy, the California particular rule is, but for the purposes of these notes--"
1989.88-1480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.236,1753.259,"So, in Arkansas the statute of limitations on a demand instrument runs from the date of its issuance?"
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1753.259,1754.221,--The date of its issuance.
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.172,1777.656,"May I ask, what is the statute of limitations in Arkansas on... on a demand note?"
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1777.656,1778.686,"--I don't know, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.686,1779.577,But it means the same--
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1779.577,1780.228,It's never less--
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.228,1783.39,"--say, if it was five years, if they left the money in the bank for five years, they could never get it back?"
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1783.39,1784.829,--I don't know the answer.
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.829,1785.44,It seems rather strange.
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1785.44,1787.452,That was never... never a question in this case.
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.513,1794.325,"But if they leave the money on deposit for longer than the statutory limitations period, they forfeit the money under your--"
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1794.325,1794.876,--I don't know.
1989.88-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.247,1798.43,--But that's the... that's the net effect of the rule that you're telling us they adopt there.
1989.88-1480,2,31857,john_matson,,1798.43,1800.039,"The issue, for purposes of this case--"
1989.88-1480,3,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,3496.88,3508.698,"Justice O'Connor, nine courts of appeals have rejected Arthur Young's test on short-term notes."
1989.88-1480,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.57,3518.035,"Well, did all of them say that this type of note was not within the nine-month exclusion?"
1989.88-1480,3,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,3518.035,3522.887,--I was addressing whether the exclusion was limited to commercial paper.
1989.88-1480,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.438,3561.882,What did the two courts decide that did deal with the demand note?
1989.88-1480,3,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,3561.882,3562.874,That they were securities.
1989.88-1480,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.217,3569.437,They were not excluded by them?
1989.88-1480,3,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,3569.437,3570.037,Correct.
1989.88-1480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3571.229,3584.747,"The... the Securities Act definition of commercial paper, which we've been told is... is the same as the words used here, it really isn't."
1989.88-1480,3,31676,john_r_mccambridge,,3609.895,3613.037,That is the single exclusion.
1989.88-1480,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3714.482,3716.555,"Thank you, Mr. McCambridge."
