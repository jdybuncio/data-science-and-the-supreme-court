1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.475,We will hear arguments next in Skipper against South Carolina.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,70.898,82.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the petitioner, Ronald Skipper, was convicted of murder and rape in the South Carolina Supreme Court, and was sentenced to death."
1985.84-6859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.758,147.367,"Mr. Bruck, does the record disclose by an offer of proof or otherwise exactly what it is that the evidence of the two corrections officers, if that is what we are dealing with, would have consisted of?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,147.367,155.174,"In terms of an offer of their testimony on the witness stand in camera, no, it does not."
1985.84-6859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.75,197.461,"For our purposes, we should consider what the evidence would have been to have consisted only of past conduct while incarcerated, is that correct, without an element of prediction of future conduct?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,197.461,200.342,"Yes, that is what was proffered."
1985.84-6859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.363,228.101,"Now, under present South Carolina law, do I understand correctly that the state would now permit such evidence to be introduced?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,228.101,230.362,"Yes, Your Honor, but for a very limited purpose."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.832,325.495,"But, of course, we did limit certiorari here, didn't we?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,325.495,326.636,Yes.
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.636,330.738,To evidence of future adaptability?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,330.738,333.69,Evidence tending to prove future adaptability.
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.69,333.88,Yes.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,333.88,336.531,"Obviously, the evidence was not offered idly."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.748,352.192,But doesn't the state say now that that very testimony would be admissible at least for some limited purpose?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,352.192,362.009,"For a very limited purpose, a purpose so limited that South Carolina has almost invariably found exclusion to be harmless error in all but one case since this time."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.009,380.5,You tell me now that South Carolina would always exclude the testimony of an expert if he purported to predict how the prisoner would act.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,380.5,381.341,That's correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.379,394.691,"Well, do you understand the state's submission now to be to the contrary?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,394.691,397.222,"--Well, yes."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.193,415.953,Is that it is wrong.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,415.953,417.646,--is that it isn't true.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,428.692,429.413,Mr. Bruck?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,429.413,430.014,--conduct.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,430.823,436.466,I am not clear as to your position in response to the questions that have been asked.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,446.013,446.574,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,446.574,452.888,And he also included that in his final speech to the jury.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,480.607,481.797,The answer to that is yes.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,481.797,482.288,That is your position?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,482.288,482.858,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,482.858,495.775,"Now, let's assume, instead of having psychiatric testimony, the only testimony to that effect came from the two prison guards and from the woman who visited the prison once a week."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,495.775,496.356,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,496.356,497.688,Not psychiatrists.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,499.649,503.382,Would it have been appropriate for that testimony to have--
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,503.382,504.012,Would that have been admissible?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,509.807,513.108,--What was offered was not speculation.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,515.369,516.469,"Right, but--"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,516.469,519.881,"If the question is, would their speculation--"
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,519.881,521.443,--you offer the past record for the purpose of showing--
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,521.443,522.102,--Correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,522.102,524.876,--the likelihood that he would not be dangerous in the future.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,524.876,525.225,Correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,525.225,526.627,"Well, now--"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,534.862,535.302,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.504,564.821,What if the state did not make future dangerousness an element of the sentencing process in any way.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,571.977,574.438,"Yes, I believe it would."
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.339,616.206,I notice you rely a great deal on Lockett when it refers to aspects of the defendant's character and record.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,623.95,626.822,--I read Lockett to say both.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,626.822,637.979,Do you think Lockett contemplated some character evaluation of how he has acted after the crime and while he is awaiting trial?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,637.979,641.831,That is my reading.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.831,644.813,"Well, isn't character an evaluation of past conduct?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,644.813,652.127,"It is partly that, and it is partly an evaluation... the jury cannot avoid the question, if we spare this man's life, then what?"
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,710.477,712.709,Suppose they gave him a trial within a week.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,725.975,728.707,--I would suggest that that would be of vanishingly small weight.
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.687,753.915,"Suppose a question to these two witnesses had been, in the hope of the court, well, now, we have asked you to describe how he has acted in the past."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,758.447,766.674,I would think that a jailer who is a person--
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.674,768.234,You mean there is no yes or no answer to that?
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,768.234,780.012,"--I would think as to the jailers the question would be proper, but I think that is a question on which the states enjoy a degree of latitude in deciding the reliability of evidence."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.242,787.618,"Out of state, so don't permit testimony on the ultimate issue the jury has to decide."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,787.618,789.468,"Well, of course, this isn't the ultimate issue."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.001,790.978,"Well, it is pretty ultimate."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,791.889,802.507,"I think if the witness was allowed to give all of the basis, all of the facts that he observed, I do not think the Constitution would require us to give a straight answer."
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,802.507,805.868,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,827.533,829.193,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.91,856.371,Including a prison guard.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,856.371,857.673,I would say including a prison guard.
1985.84-6859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.387,877.115,"But a state, if it permits the prison guard to testify on what he has seen and heard, wouldn't need to permit an opinion from him."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,877.115,878.546,That is correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.368,945.93,Let me go back to the question I put to you before lunch.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,971.947,973.209,--Yes.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.953,989.027,"Ordinarily the character of a person like reputation is based on always past events, isn't it?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,989.027,990.8,Yes.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.8,993.903,"Not necessarily current events, but things past."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,993.903,998.685,"Well, things past up to the time when his character is being evaluated, which is at the time of the trial."
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.552,1027.473,Are you saying he might be able to function very well in the controlled environment of a prison.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1027.473,1028.164,Correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.164,1029.205,Is that the issue--
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1029.205,1031.216,That certainly was.
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.216,1033.457,"--that society is probing at, how he is going to act in prison?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1033.457,1036.128,"Yes, that is the issue."
1985.84-6859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.388,1066.91,"Yes, but some states bar evidence that is not ante litem motam, so to speak, evidence that may have been concocted by a party over a short period of time after the event which is being judged came into effect."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1080.257,1092.235,"The prosecutor can certainly say that to the jury, but I don't think the state can say as a matter of law that because of the danger that defendant is putting on an act, that therefore that cannot even be weighed by the jury, that the jury can't even hear it."
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1131.531,1136.083,"Counsel, maybe I am way off base, but I don't quite understand."
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1145.55,1160.641,"Would not be helped in the sense that if the trier of fact concluded that his conduct would be bad, that he would be violent in jail, that he would rape other inmates, as the prosecutor argued in this case, that would be a consideration weighing in favor of death."
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.984,1169.326,You put the testimony on.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1169.326,1170.708,--That's correct.
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1170.708,1173.889,He couldn't withdraw it.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1173.889,1181.844,"Oh, you mean if the witnesses were called and they said, as a matter of fact, this guy was being a real problem, he banged on the bars and that is about all we have got to say about it."
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1181.844,1184.455,"But you couldn't blame that on the state, could you?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1184.455,1185.397,Absolutely not.
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.397,1188.61,So you don't begin to have the man electrocuted.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1188.61,1190.74,That is right.
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.261,1198.325,"You wouldn't feel any counsel responsibility for it at all, would you?"
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1198.325,1202.928,--I would feel grave responsibility if I called a witness and didn't know what he was going to say and he hurt my client.
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1202.928,1204.728,I sure hope so.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1204.728,1204.908,"Yes, Sir."
1985.84-6859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.095,1263.958,I doubt you will find any prisoner that at some time didn't bang on the bars.
1985.84-6859,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1263.958,1288.864,"Well, I agree with that, Your Honor, and I believe that is exactly what defense counsel proffered the jailers to say, that after this initial little problem he had the night he was locked up, he made a good adaptation and did fine, and the jury could fairly have concluded from that that he would have done all right if they spared his life and sent him to prison, and that, of course, is the testimony the jury never got to hear."
1985.84-6859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.918,1296.538,Very well.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1302.082,1314.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the state's position in this case may, if you will, be reduced to one simple sentence."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.62,1362.673,What was excluded here?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1362.673,1374.641,"What was excluded in this case, Justice White, was one thing, and that was predictive testimony from lay witnesses."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.641,1375.76,"That wasn't what was asked, was it?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1375.76,1378.541,"That was my understanding, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.541,1384.756,What was the question that these prison guards weren't permitted to answer?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1384.756,1388.108,"Your Honor, there was never any specific testimony proffered."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.404,1405.6,Weren't they just going to... wasn't it just said that they were going to testify about how he had conducted himself since he had been in jail?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1405.6,1408.351,"No, Your Honor, I would disagree with that."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1408.351,1412.685,But Mr. Bruck said this morning before noon.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1412.685,1436.121,"Your Honor, I think if you look, for example, at the top of Appendix Page 4, the trial judge is confronted with what he is going to admit into evidence, and I think at Appendix Page 4 he very clearly says that insofar as evidence is offered which pertains to the characteristics of the defendant, it is admissible into evidence."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1470.512,1471.444,And what page is that?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1471.444,1474.335,"--That is at Appendix Page 10, Justice White."
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.277,1498.091,"In South Carolina, is that the way you proffer proof?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1501.643,1504.366,A summary from counsel is usually considered--
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.366,1508.466,"This witness, if permitted to testify, would testify as follows."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1509.949,1512.01,"--Justice Marshall, they do it one of several ways."
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1523.507,1526.699,Do you consider this a proffer of proof?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1526.699,1529.83,I would consider this an offer of proof.
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1531.172,1532.953,Of what?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1535.184,1549.275,"--I would say this is an offer of proof offered to relate back to the question he was attempting to elicit from the witness, which was a prediction of future conduct over a period of years."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1563.615,1577.121,"Well, Mr. Coombs, suppose, just suppose that all that they wanted to offer was the testimony of the corrections officers about past conduct while in jail?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1577.121,1581.086,"Justice O'Connor, that would have been admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.535,1582.805,Pardon me?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1582.805,1583.376,Admissible.
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.376,1593.123,And would it be admissible for the purpose of proving future adjustability to prison life?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1593.123,1598.868,"Okay, Justice O'Connor, at that point we come to what is meant by prison life."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.339,1635.46,"Well, you didn't answer my question."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1649.401,1655.602,"--It depends what you mean by future adjustment in prison, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.927,1662.728,Yes.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1662.728,1664.498,"--yes, it would be admissible, very clearly admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.498,1664.748,Yes.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1680.941,1684.043,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.807,1694.067,Isn't that the prosecutor's argument at the end?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1705.006,1708.847,"--That was the prosecutor's inference, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1715.732,1727.721,But don't you think that it is arguable that the defendant should have been allowed to rebut that inference with testimony of this type from corrections officers?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1727.721,1743.902,"If the testimony from the corrections officers had been proffered for the purpose of testifying to things that they had observed concerning Ronnie Skipper when he was in jail, that testimony was admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.902,1745.853,That is exactly what Mr. Dusenberry said.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1753.808,1757.52,"Okay, that is from, I would guess, Appendix Page 11."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.52,1758.131,Yes.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1779.215,1785.788,"Justice White, again, you have to look at the question that was raised."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.09,1790.011,I thought I just did.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1790.011,1792.533,"--That is part of the offer of proof, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.254,1830.067,"So you would say that you would say, we should judge this case, at you say we should, on the basis that if all the wanted to do was to put on these two jailers to testify how these people had... how this defendant had behaved himself in prison in the past, it would have been admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1830.067,1833.399,"--I am sorry, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.611,1851.412,"Well, if the defense had said, I want to call these two prison guards, I want to ask them how this defendant has conducted himself in the past, while he has been in prison, admissible, I gather."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1851.412,1852.613,That would have been admissible.
1985.84-6859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.094,1860.787,"Well, that is hard to justify in light of the colloquy on Page 11, I think, Mr. Coombs."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1899.703,1919.696,"I think, Justice Rehnquist, you have to look at the entire record, and I think at that point, on that one isolated page of the appendix, that the trial judge still has the objection on his mind from Page 10, but we can certainly look, for example, at Appendix Page 4."
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.035,1938.879,And his wife was permitted to testify about how he had conducted himself.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1938.879,1944.282,"--His wife, his former wife was certainly permitted to testify about how he conducted himself in prison--"
1985.84-6859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.282,1948.754,The same sort of things that the prison guards were going to talk about.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1948.754,1955.089,"--If the prison guards limited their testimony to things that they had actually seen, that is exactly right, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.261,1961.214,"I am having difficulty following your argument, counsel."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1967.708,1970.821,Evidence about his conduct certainly was admissible.
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1970.821,1980.374,"Now his counsel then offers to present evidence on precisely that question, and you say it is not admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,1980.374,1987.42,"I think, Your Honor, the question is, what does the trial judge have on his mind in Appendix Page 11."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1987.42,1990.842,"Well, we have to go on the basis of the record, not what is in his mind."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2007.683,2014.037,"Our position, Your Honor, is that observations of past conduct are admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.094,2030.677,"May I ask on that, directed at what issue is the evidence of past conduct admissible?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2035.823,2041.326,"Again, that means... you have to consider what you mean by prison life."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.556,2047.751,Whatever the judge meant when he said it is not admissible on adjustability to prison life.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2050.302,2055.325,"--If you mean showering, how often does he shower, that is not admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.34,2066.811,Let me just keep you on this for a moment.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2078.589,2080.72,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.72,2083.682,Then how do you defend the judge's ruling at the bottom of Page 11?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2083.682,2091.599,The only thing I can say there is that he still had on his mind the question that was raised at Appendix Page 10.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.599,2094.311,Where do you get your view of the law then?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2094.311,2096.431,"I get my view, for example, from the whole--"
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.431,2101.365,Do you agree he committed error because he didn't understand the question?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2101.365,2103.756,--I don't think he understood one single question.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.756,2106.638,"That just explains, it doesn't justify the error."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2107.878,2116.294,"No, he didn't commit error because he let in everything that was offered to show past conduct and he put this to the jury."
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.716,2187.99,"You agree that these two guards testify as to certain facts, and that would be admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2187.99,2191.092,"We don't have that in the record, but just hypothetically."
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.092,2195.227,Do you agree that there are some things he could say that would be admissible?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2195.227,2195.815,I certainly do.
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.815,2197.357,And the judge kept it out?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2197.357,2198.897,I do not agree with that.
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.897,2200.429,What did the judge say?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2201.34,2205.102,"He said at the top of Appendix Page 4, for example, he said anything--"
1985.84-6859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.102,2206.864,I am talking about Page 11.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2216.859,2234.61,"--Transcript Page 11 or Appendix Page 11 takes place for one reason, because on Page 10 defense counsel has asked his former wife to make a prediction as to what his behavior in prison is going to be over a period of years."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2372.972,2376.055,I am still having difficulty.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2406.182,2409.655,"I certainly have, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.81,2440.506,"The judge has told him categorically, whether he can or cannot adjust to prison life is not an issue in this case."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2440.506,2445.479,"--Again, Mr. Chief Justice, the transcript at Page 1,257."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2475.449,2479.94,"But he said the contrary, categorically."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2479.94,2480.711,That is exactly right.
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2510.451,2514.074,So are you arguing that the error was harmless?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2514.074,2526.022,It was a mere number of words that made absolutely no difference whatsoever as to what was admitted or not admitted at trial.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.919,2552.238,What do you say about the opinion of the South Carolina Supreme Court that says that the convicted murderer's adaptability to prison life is not a matter of any relevance to the sentencing proceeding?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2552.238,2557.962,"Justice Stevens, that again goes to what the South Carolina Supreme Court has considered prison life to be."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.528,2574.382,Where does the opinion in Koon I make that differentiation between kinds of adaptability to prison life?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2574.382,2575.433,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.236,2578.786,"You are reading the opinion, not anything in the opinion itself."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2578.786,2580.118,Not in the opinion itself.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.118,2594.479,"But it is clear, is it not, that the judge apparently read his reference to what is not admissible is exactly the same thing the South Carolina Supreme Court said, that adjustability to prison life... they used the word adaptability instead of adjustability... is not an issue at the penalty hearing."
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2594.479,2595.748,"With one exception, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.119,2612.739,"The same day as Koon I, right?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2612.739,2635.295,"--I believe... I know it had come out one day apart, roughly at the same time."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.518,2641.779,That is a little different from adjustability to prison life.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2644.14,2649.823,--I think future nondangerousness could well be construed as being the same thing as future good conduct in prison.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.823,2651.135,Let me just put it this way.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2662.393,2665.415,"In the present case, it was admissible."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.415,2667.676,As a general proposition?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2667.676,2674.541,It is generally admissible so long as it concerns matters of consequence.
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.813,2683.647,What was the evidence at stake in Koon I that was excluded?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2691.061,2696.736,"I think it was talking about predicted future conduct, Your Honor, not taking a shower."
1985.84-6859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.034,2713.367,Do you think that the Supreme Court of South Carolina knew what it was saying when it wrote that opinion?
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2715.768,2720.91,"I just read the opinions, Your Honor."
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2724.232,2729.976,"Counsel, wasn't the evidence excluded in Koon I evidence of an expert?"
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2733.139,2735.62,"I believe, Your Honor, it was expert testimony, but it was--"
1985.84-6859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2735.62,2737.582,It wasn't lay testimony.
1985.84-6859,1,26736,harold_m_coombs_jr,,2737.582,2747.749,"--It was expert testimony, I believe, that was concerned with prison life, adjustability to this very vague, nebulous term, prison life."
1985.84-6859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.508,2810.329,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bruck?"
1985.84-6859,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2810.329,2814.173,"Yes, Your Honor, only two points which I would like to touch on very briefly."
1985.84-6859,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2940.805,2959.148,"Well, there is certainly some evidence of confusion in the transcript on Page 11, where counsel says I am offering it to prove what did happen, and the trial judge says, well, his answer is such, he indicates he still thinks it is being offered to prove future conduct."
1985.84-6859,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2959.148,2962.708,"--Well, it is being offered to prove future conduct, his past conduct."
1985.84-6859,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.629,2965.299,"Well, yes."
1985.84-6859,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2974.446,2986.055,--The main point I really got to my feet again to make was simply in the answer to Justice O'Connor's questions and the answers to Justice Steven's question were not correct.
1985.84-6859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.122,3090.524,"Thank you, counsel."
