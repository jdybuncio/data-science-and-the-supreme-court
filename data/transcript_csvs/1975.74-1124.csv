1975.74-1124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.295,"At 1:00 pm, we will hear 74-1110."
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,20.031,23.831,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1975.74-1124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,81.833,83.223,"May I ask, Ms. Rose?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,93.643,102.727,"Well, when the Internal Revenue Service issues Revenue Rulings, they give no notice and opportunity for comment."
1975.74-1124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,105.62,111.113,"Yes, and whether or not the other rulings were rulings of this kind, that is what the question is."
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,111.113,112.657,Yes.
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.494,163.381,"Ms. Rose, may I ask you a kind of a preliminary question as to how you plan to structure your argument?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,170.903,176.474,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,840.41,846.09,"Do they know of nothing about healthcare, now do we know more about it?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,846.09,863.066,"Well I do not think, I would Mr. Chief Justice, that I do not know if this Court knows more about it but -- and I also do not know if the Court of Appeals might know more about it, but these on -- what the Court of Appeals did is they made findings, they made findings without a record."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.636,1000.33,"Well, how about, you say very little in your reply brief about our decision last spring in Warth against Seldin."
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1003.762,1012.192,"Yes, and I will -- if you like I will turn to Warth v. Seldin now, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.313,1032.405,Yours is kind of a house-of-jack bill type of causation.
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1048.682,1051.523,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I disagree."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.854,1088.366,Was that statute intended to confer any discreet rights on your clients?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1088.366,1090.324,"Oh! Yes, absolutely."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.324,1092.089,"Well, what is your authority for that?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1092.089,1099.574,"I think the whole history of the reason for the charitable provision of the code, just as the charity in the charitable trust --"
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.574,1102.273,Has this -- go ahead.
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1102.273,1111.128,"In fact, the defendants in their Treasury Regulation, when they start off to finding what is charitable, they say principally for the relief of the poor."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.128,1124.722,Has this Court ever entertained an action of this kind where is that the claimed beneficiaries of a tax deduction as attenuated in situation as yours?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1127.387,1131.873,"From this Court, I do not know of any case from this Court, there are lower Courts --"
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1131.873,1132.655,I do not either.
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1132.655,1146.056,"Yes, the whole -- in 1930s there is a House report on the reason for the charitable provisions of the code, it is to lessen the burdens of government."
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.117,1179.83,"Well, that -- would that be in existent or without the letter from the Revenue Service, would these hospitals have served the poor?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1179.83,1184.228,"Well, if, truly -- well, Your Honor, if the --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.228,1188.857,Suppose a hospitalâ€™s exemption have been revoked for failing to serve the poor --
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1188.857,1190.022,"Well, if a hospital --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.022,1191.296,How would that have helped you?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1191.296,1201.987,"Well, well we are not seeking, this gets of course into the Americans, United and Bob Jones issues, we are not seeking whatsoever to have anything revoked with, except --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.987,1203.678,"I understand that, I understand that."
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1203.678,1205.091,If a hospital --
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.091,1215.175,But you are saying -- you are saying that the modification of the rule permits the exemption despite the failure to serve charities?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1215.175,1216.407,"Well, let me turn this around --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.407,1223.593,"And if these hospitals have not served charities, they are, under the prior rule, their letters would have been revoked?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1223.593,1234.324,"We presume that when the -- all through the years the Internal Revenue Service required service to the poor and hospitals would deem to be charitable, that they were obeying the law, the entire Internal Revenue Code --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.324,1237.812,But they were not required to do it?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1243.478,1244.222,If they wanted to be tax --
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.222,1246.767,They did not break any law if they did not serve the poor?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1246.767,1253.634,"If hospitals wanted to lose their tax exemption, but -- but that is mere -- that is a great degree of speculation."
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.444,1257.77,Upon whose side --?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1257.77,1262.597,"Mr. Justice White, hospitals are tax-exempt, they not --"
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.597,1266.987,These days when the profit and loss statements of hospitals looks like different than they used to?
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1266.987,1271.288,"Well, Your Honor, may I state several different responses to that."
1975.74-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.584,1326.983,"Well, I just thought you ought to be making the standing argument."
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1326.983,1330.35,"Okay, okay."
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.494,1402.936,"How about immunity and the Anti-Injunction Act, you have come to those?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1402.936,1410.14,We -- the Anti-Injunction Act and the declaratory judgment provision are not pertinent.
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.961,1451.319,"We do not rely on Scan, well, then you simply rely on Larson?"
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1451.319,1459.187,"No we have the alternatives, if you dwell on Larson, if you find for some reason that the Larson does not apply them we are relying on Scamwel (ph) --"
1975.74-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.187,1460.718,Which is not a case in this Court.
1975.74-1124,0,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,1460.718,1471.019,"No, the, it is the Court below, but basically we are saying that for cases that are APA cases, sovereign immunity no longer exists."
1975.74-1124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.412,1498.761,Mr. Smith.
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1498.761,1501.454,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.697,1567.41,And those are private --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1567.41,1568.467,And those are private.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1568.467,1572.02,"Sent to an individual, in response to an individual inquiry?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1572.02,1573.054,Exactly.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1573.054,1575.063,And few of those are later published?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1575.063,1578.094,A few of those are later published anonymously.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1626.517,1629.409,How are these disseminated and published --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1629.409,1630.733,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.733,1632.097,-- law officers have reached --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1632.097,1653.105,"Every two weeks the Internal Revenue Service I think publishes a, something called the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and then every six months or so those are bound in what is known a cumulative bulletin, and those are distributed to people, officers of the Internal Revenue Service and people generally who are interested in the development of the tax law."
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.105,1655.454,And private tax lawyers can subscribe to it --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1655.454,1660.273,"Private tax lawyers can subscribe, exactly and indeed anyone can subscribe (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1660.273,1666.088,You pay a fee and you get it directly from the Internal Revenue Service?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1666.088,1668.033,Yes.
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.173,1692.97,And they do that occasionally in spite of the bulletin --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1692.97,1699.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, we try our best, the Internal Revenue Service tries its best, but often mistakes are made."
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.113,1701.142,Have a lot of them to deal with?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1701.142,1710.718,"Yes, and that these Internal -- -this Revenue Rulings are an attempt to mitigate and minimize those unfortunate instances."
1975.74-1124,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.856,1803.15,"Is it not the, is it still true today as I think it was a hundred years ago (Inaudible) a revenue rule is maybe with an exception or two about the lowest form of animal life in the formal weight of the rulings --"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1803.15,1805.938,"I think that so, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-1124,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1823.101,1826.63,"I know, we always hopefully look for a TD or something of a little --"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1826.63,1830.63,"Oh! Absolutely, that is a higher from of tax life, there is no doubt about that."
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.63,1834.913,"And the one we are talking about here appears begins on 6A of the appendix to your brief, is it not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1834.913,1838.36,"Exactly, that is Revenue Ruling 69-545."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.502,2030.545,"Mr. Smith, you are not suggesting that the issuance of this Revenue Ruling, it was not a rather substantial event?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2030.545,2032.894,"It was a substantial event, Mr. Justice White --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.894,2037.375,I mean the day before the law was not that hospital like that.
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2043.031,2058.487,"I do not -- I am not sure that is right, because although the plaintiffs cite many cases for the preposition that the pre-care requirement was an absolute requirement, there is no reported decision and I have found one and there is no instance that I know about the Internal Revenue Service --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.487,2063.309,"But I take it you are arguing the case is though, even assuming that that was the case?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2063.309,2066.554,"Even assuming that was the case, that there was --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.554,2073.178,That the Revenue Service at the moment it issued that ruling was then applying the Revenue laws completely different than it had before.
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2075.292,2076.33,That is right.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.714,2081.349,"And in fact that was the understanding of the tax bar pretty much, was it not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2081.349,2083.536,It was the understanding of the -- it was the understanding (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2083.536,2084.856,(Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2084.856,2100.857,"Although quite frankly, I think if the decisions that the plaintiffs cite of the Court of Appeals indicate that there really is, there was no instance in which the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax exemption of a hospital solely because they denied free care to the indigent."
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2100.857,2118.585,"May I ask, now that I have interrupted you, this involves the -- the tax benefit that a donor or a hospital as a donee or legatee as well as its hospitals own income, does it not --"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2118.585,2118.93,That is right.
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2118.93,2119.26,Both (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2119.26,2122.66,"That is right, the deductibility of contributions, or the state tax --"
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.66,2123.436,They go together?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2123.436,2124.857,"Yes, yes, they do."
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.857,2125.386,Thank you.
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2125.386,2161.948,"Now, given the fact that this Ruling that is under challenge here just presents these two hypothetical polar examples, I think it is important to point that if a particular hospital decided that it did not need an emergency room for a particular -- for particular reason because of its own mode of operation, it would not necessarily have been denied of tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service, and that to us demonstrates the hypothetical quality of this suit because this Ruling came up, or was published on an abbreviated set of facts."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.714,2177.07,No hospitals were parties to this action at all?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2177.07,2184.179,"No hospitals were parties to this action at all, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and to us this demonstrates an important point --"
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.179,2189.808,"Well, do the government ever move to dismiss the action on the basis of failure to join indispensable party?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2189.808,2199.163,"No we do not regard the hospital as an indispensable party within the technical meaning of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but --"
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.163,2200.654,"Well, why do you not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2200.654,2219.447,"Well, simply because -- well, I do not think -- I think that if a hospital had been joined as a party, then I think we would essentially be faced here with whether a particular -- that particular hospitalâ€™s exemption should be -- should continue to stand on."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.457,2222.126,"Well, but now that-that -- that is not --"
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.126,2224.032,(Voice Overlap) hurt is the hospital?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2224.032,2227.832,The only person that might get hurt -- the only entity that might get hurt is the hospital --
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.832,2230.393,And that does not make them a indispensable party?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2230.393,2252.815,"It makes them an indispensable -- it makes them an indispensable party, but the jointer of one, two, three or indeed a dozen hospitals would not -- would not solve the tag -- would not create a broad rule, which would be applicable to the hospitals generally because each hospital continues to remain free to litigate its own right to an exemption on its own particular facts."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.906,2279.97,What you are saying is it is not a case of controversy?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2279.97,2285.986,"Essentially, it is not -- it is not a concrete case, which wants a decision by a Federal Court."
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.986,2287.668,What motions did you file?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2287.668,2287.956,What did you say?
1975.74-1124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2287.956,2290.546,"What motions did you file, did you --"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2290.546,2299.938,"We filed the motion, essentially the position that we advance here was advanced in the lower courts, we moved to dismiss for a lack of standing, for because --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.938,2300.648,Because the state has cause of action --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2300.648,2310.482,-- state cause of action for that this suit comes within tax exemption of the Declaratory Judgment Act that is not appropriate for judicial resolution.
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.01,2312.844,"So you filed motions to dismiss, basically?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2312.844,2316.538,Yes and the District Court denied the motions to -- the motion to dismiss --
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.538,2318.71,Then you filed a motion for judgment on the --
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2318.71,2319.31,Yes.
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.31,2319.815,-- for judgment?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2319.815,2332.856,"Yes, and the District Court -- essentially the District Court decided that it had jurisdiction, held the Ruling invalid, and granted broad -- you know the broad declaratory relief that the plaintiffs seek."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.31,2347.566,"Supposing the District Court had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, would that have had financial consequences to hospitals?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2347.566,2352.166,"It may had have financial consequences to some hospitals, but it is entirely unclear as to how many."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.915,2396.17,"So from the indispensable partiesâ€™ point of view, the only answer that would have been to enjoin to every single hospital that pays taxes in the country?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2396.17,2402.71,"Exactly, and that to us demonstrates, you know, the hypothetical and abstract quality of this suit."
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.994,2468.521,"Mr. Smith, one thing that is not clear to me, if this letter is declared out, what does it change if anything?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2468.521,2477.356,"If this letter is declared out, it change -- I do not -- it change, it seems --"
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.356,2480.889,"What would it change, it would not change anything, would it?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2480.889,2484.108,It would not change a tax liability of any hospital.
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.108,2488.59,I suppose that is why you are saying it should have not -- no judgment would have entered in the first place?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2488.59,2496.8,"Exactly, exactly, this is really an, you know, a request for an abstract decision on an abstract set of facts."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.8,2508.218,"Well but if, if it turns on your answer to Mr. Justice Marshallâ€™s question, then if the ruling would have changed the liability of some hospital, would your answer then be different?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2508.218,2528.244,"No, my answer would not be different, simply because as we have point out at great length in our brief, we do not think that third parties -- we do not think that the Internal Revenue Code confers a private right of action on non-taxpayers to contest the tax liability of any particular -- of any particular person."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.084,2586.244,You would not let them into any suit at anything with respect to whether a hospital was exempt or not?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2586.244,2588.425,"I would not let -- that is right, we do not think --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.425,2600.101,"So that this particular group or poor people generally who would like free service cannot litigate, as far as you are concerned, the exemption or non-exemption of hospitals?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2600.101,2615.191,"Exactly, anymore than (a) cannot litigate the propriety of a ruling given to (b) if he does like (b) if he thinks (b) is a competitor of his, if he thinks that for one abstract reason or another that the Ruling was incorrect."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.825,2701.357,"Can anybody, can any person that you know of challenge the, an exemption letter?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2706.71,2707.832,No.
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.832,2713.25,"So that if you want to grant an exemption letter, whether it conforms to the statute or not you are home free?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2713.25,2714.255,"Well, Mr. Justice White --"
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.255,2716.662,"No, yes or no, is the (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2716.662,2725.433,"The answer is yes, but the -- but that has been a decision of Congress to confer this, the power to administer the tax laws and the commissioner of Internal Revenue, and --"
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.433,2733.915,"Some Congressman becomes aware of this, gets exited or not he could embark on some kind of an investigation or inquiry, could he not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2733.915,2741.947,"Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, a simple letter to the Internal Revenue Service, I have found by member of Congress elicited a very prompt response."
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2741.947,2744.838,And if it does not then they can go on with congressional inquiry?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2744.838,2747.449,"Absolutely, and they can enact legislation."
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2760.275,2761.644,"They do not sometimes, do they not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2761.644,2767.767,"They do that, in fact the present incumbent commissioner of Internal Revenue has been before Congress some twenty-nine times in the last year."
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.621,2873.934,Would the Dorsheimer case would go of on standing or on --place of controversy?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2873.934,2876.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is very hard to know how that case went off."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.222,2917.658,Instead audit somebody and allow the depreciation deduction and nobody can really challenge it?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2917.658,2920.327,"Exactly, exactly."
1975.74-1124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2943.925,2948.729,"Mr. Smith, these Rulings are subject, are they not at any time of revocation?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2948.729,2949.493,Of course.
1975.74-1124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2949.493,2954.778,And even when revocation may affect a given taxpayer?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2954.778,2969.139,"Indeed, the Internal Revenue Service reserves the right to revoke something retroactively and it generally only does it when there is an omission of the material fact, but he can do in this Court and Dixon and American Automobile Association has said that he can do it."
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.026,2975.915,"That can be tested in the chartable case by the contributor, can he?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2975.915,2979.603,"That can be tested in the charitable -- yes, as the Court have indicated in Bob Jones."
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.603,2990.835,"But in the other case where a guy is in some corporation or foundation has violated his exemption, nobody can do anything about that, but the Commissioner?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2990.835,2994.834,"Exactly, of course the public has a right to bring the matter to the attention of the Commissioner."
1975.74-1124,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.834,2996.969,But no legal action could reach it?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2996.969,3000.46,"Absolutely, in the same way that as we point out in our brief."
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.053,3132.903,"Mr. Smith, can the Commissioner or the secretary be sued in any one of the ninety-three judicial districts?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3132.903,3138.749,"I think so simply because he has -- you know the Internal Revenue District office is there, so I would think that he could --"
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.749,3142.902,"So you know, it is not just a question of litigation in the District of Columbia Circuit I think?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3142.902,3144.877,I think that is probably right --
1975.74-1124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.877,3146.936,"Bob Jones came up out of the Fourth Circuit, did he not?"
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3146.936,3152.464,"Right, yes, Bob Jones came up through the District Courts, yes."
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.497,3178.321,It did not came out of this?
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3178.321,3182.614,The reasons we have set forth probably at two greater length than our brief --
1975.74-1124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.614,3184.9,Can you say that again [Laughter]
1975.74-1124,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3184.9,3195.819,We submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed and remanded to the District Court for an entry of judgment dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
1975.74-1124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.819,3199.83,"Thank your Mr. Smith, and Ms. Rose, your time is up Ms. Rose."
1975.74-1124,2,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,3199.83,3202.581,My time is up?
1975.74-1124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3202.581,3207.075,"Do you have something factually to raise other than the argument, we will give you a moment."
1975.74-1124,2,36572,marilyn_g_rose,,3207.075,3209.391,May I make one statement of fact.
1975.74-1124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.575,3228.489,Thank you Ms. Rose.
