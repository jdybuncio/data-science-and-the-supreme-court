1999.98-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.23,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1701, the United States v. Gary Locke, and 19-8... 98-1706, International Association of Tanker Owners v. Locke."
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,14.592,24.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.592,200.883,"May I... may I ask you, Mr. Benner, if you take the position that all 13 of the provisions before us here are preempted by Federal law itself or that some of them are preempted by Coast Guard regulation?"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,200.883,212.921,"--We take the position that all of them, Justice O'Connor, are preempted by Federal law itself in the subject matters described in 46 U.S.C., section 3703."
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.921,213.351,Some sort of field preemption.
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,213.351,213.562,Yes.
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.984,217.295,Yes.
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,217.295,222.39,There is a condition of field preemption that surrounds that component of the United States Code.
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.39,230.395,"So, your first position would be that field preemption applies and we don't have to look further."
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,230.395,231.755,That is correct.
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.039,239.03,A fall-back provision.
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,239.361,254.652,--We... we have also pointed to... to instances in which the United States Coast Guard has spoken expressly preemptively in its regulations and that those express preemptive statements are entitled to deference.
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.652,261.315,And there you rely on Coast Guard regulations that contain language expressly preempting State law?
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,261.315,262.478,"Yes, that is correct."
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.518,281.562,"But if the Coast Guard were silent on some of these points, you still think there is Federal--"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,281.562,283.721,"Indeed, Justice O'Connor, that is--"
1999.98-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,283.721,286.944,--Do you think your position is entirely consistent with our decision in Ray?
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,289.037,289.387,--Yes.
1999.98-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.991,306.921,"Well, but also the Court held that some of the regulations were valid in that--"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,306.921,333.37,"--The... the two that were held valid by the Court in Ray that... that maybe illustrate our point are, one, a tug escort provision, which was not held valid under what we are calling title II, as a shorthand reference, to PWSA, the 3703(a) subject matters, but was held valid under title I of PWSA which was a discretionary element of the law and remains a discretionary element of the law."
1999.98-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.878,362.77,"--Oh, I understand that, but that's your second... that's your fall-back argument."
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,366.621,383.223,"--That is our argument because we believe that every one of these regulations falls within the understood meaning of design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, particularly in this case personnel qualifications and manning and operations."
1999.98-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.223,388.796,"Why should manning and operations... I mean, why shouldn't the State have something to say about that?"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,388.796,400.734,"I think to understand why it's important to the Federal system, Your Honor, that... that all of these things work together, you have to understand the system... the vessel as a system."
1999.98-1701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.067,426.21,"Well, what do you concede is left open to States in this area?"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,430.533,458.351,"The language, Justice O'Connor, that you find in... in much of the maritime preemption case law that this Court has generated about local conditions seems to be related to such matters as fishing, conservation, that kind of thing, or is... is recited before, in the case of Ray, finding that the tug escort provision was a title I discretionary PWSA matter."
1999.98-1701,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.992,471.53,"Well, how do we know that the... the provisions of Washington law you are contesting necessarily fall under title II and not under title I?"
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,476.533,477.835,--Yes.
1999.98-1701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.801,534.753,I must say I don't understand.
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,543.017,543.027,--Yes.
1999.98-1701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.027,548.971,"--which is what you're doing, it means, whether or not the Government acts, we've occupied the field."
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,569.096,575.811,"Justice Scalia, we make a distinction between title II of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act and title I of that act."
1999.98-1701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.646,587.159,But Justice Ginsburg's question drew your attention to the fact that you could place these matters under title I.--
1999.98-1701,0,18447,c_jonathan_benner,,587.159,599.446,I... I don't believe you can place all of them under title I. The... the ambiguity about the distinction between title I and title II is the use of the word operating requirements in title I and the word operations in title II.
1999.98-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.94,618.012,"--Thank you, Mr. Benner."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,621.464,631.53,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1701,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,675.518,681.181,"Well, could we talk about whether it's field preemption or conflict preemption or something else?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,687.616,687.866,--That's--
1999.98-1701,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,687.866,688.547,Where are we?
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,688.547,690.128,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, we're in both."
1999.98-1701,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,691.67,692.0,Well--
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,692.0,709.082,"Some of the... some of the issues here involve the fields, and they relate to the vessel as a system, what the qualifications are of the personnel aboard, what manning requirements are... are imposed, what kinds of equipment has to be tested at particular times and operational."
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.241,756.702,"--Well, may I ask... you say visibility and piloting."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,759.844,760.655,Watchkeeping.
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.655,761.366,Watchkeeping.
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,771.361,777.306,That's... that... it's not subject to field preemption within the statutory fields of title II.
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.002,788.733,"Well, you say that that would be bad only if it's covered by a Coast Guard regulation."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,788.733,789.184,--That's correct.
1999.98-1701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.879,819.133,I don't understand how you... how you get into the definition of the field the matter of local conditions.
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,846.142,849.014,"That's why I stressed arguably, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.899,858.289,That's a more honest... that's... that's a more honest explanation.
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,858.54,858.94,No.
1999.98-1701,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.251,888.541,"Mr. Frederick, the lower courts didn't get into any of... any of this, and so far, no one has mentioned the basis of their decision which was section 1018."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,890.701,893.452,I would be happy to address the error of the court of appeals' reasoning.
1999.98-1701,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.444,952.411,"--Well, Mr. Frederick, if we agree with you on that point and if we also agree that in fact the court gave a rather restricted reading of Ray, simply assuming that its principles went no further than the design and construction, shouldn't we simply at that point vacate and send this thing back rather than in the first instance, as if we were a court of... of first instance, parse our way through every regulation?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,952.411,956.344,"--Justice Souter, that would be an eminently reasonable holding of this Court."
1999.98-1701,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,975.407,989.927,"But am... am I right that if... that your position is that if we agree with you on 1018 and we agree with you on the restricted reading given to Ray, that those two points are sufficient to require vacation and... and remand?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,989.927,1010.233,"Yes, and we would urge the Court to reaffirm the title II/title I preemptive dichotomy that the Court explained in Ray and to show that those issues and subjects in 46 U.S.C. 3703(a) are entitled to the same field preemptive consequences because they basically allow for the same reasons."
1999.98-1701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.281,1034.516,"Mr. Frederick, before you get too far away from section 1018, doesn't... doesn't section 1018 support the respondent at least to this extent?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1067.358,1069.732,"No, Justice Scalia, for several reasons."
1999.98-1701,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1125.806,1133.081,How would you characterize then the principal error of the Ninth Circuit with reference to the savings clause?
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1143.289,1145.219,"Well, I think there are a couple of errors."
1999.98-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.051,1194.834,"Mr. Frederick, there's a difference between--"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1224.644,1236.381,--Congress specifically took local concerns into consideration in enacting the PWSA title I where it directed the Coast Guard to take into account the views of State and local officials in promulgating local traffic rules.
1999.98-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.169,1251.612,"But a very subordinate one, obviously."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1251.612,1258.378,"Well, the Congress made very clear it wanted there to be one decision maker, and there are important international ramifications to that."
1999.98-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.601,1268.826,"Well, what would be the international ramifications of saying that... of the State of Washington saying that in a heavy fog coming into Seattle harbor, you had to have a tug?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1268.826,1274.558,"--The international ramifications are as follows, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.023,1335.538,"May I ask, to what extent do the Coast Guard regulations are... to what extent are they uniform or harbor-specific?"
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1335.538,1337.729,"--It varies widely, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.642,1347.796,But they might have a... just to take an... they might have a regulation that would apply specifically to Puget Sound and nowhere else--
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1347.796,1348.357,--That's correct.
1999.98-1701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.357,1349.496,--to cover the specific--
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1349.496,1352.108,"That's correct, or even to a part of Puget Sound."
1999.98-1701,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.8,1373.444,"--Mr. Frederick, there's another difference between you and Mr. Benner."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1397.36,1402.662,"--Justice Ginsburg, we didn't brief the question because we don't regard it as necessary for the Court to decide."
1999.98-1701,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1556.811,1566.058,Have we ever said that the ratification of an international convention is sufficient to show field preemption?
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1566.058,1581.609,"I don't... I don't know of a case on that subject, Justice Kennedy, and I'm not sure that it's relevant for this purpose because Congress, in each instance of those acts... and we've provided the citations in our brief... has not only ratified, but it has directed the Coast Guard to engage in that enforcement."
1999.98-1701,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.267,1602.532,Are you saying that then... that these new treaties and laws that you refer to show express preemption?
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1602.532,1603.354,--No.
1999.98-1701,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1611.198,1618.494,How... on... on what aspect of preemption then do these international agreements and obligations bear?
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1618.494,1620.064,In two ways.
1999.98-1701,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1652.445,1659.21,"Well, if they just give effect to a title II field preemption that's already there, then it doesn't add anything to the... to the case."
1999.98-1701,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1659.21,1667.906,"Well, it adds in the sense that there are specific provisions here that make very clear the occupation of the field and Congress' intent to do so."
1999.98-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.557,1671.719,"Very well, Mr. Frederick."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1674.01,1693.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1758.063,1767.77,"Mr. Collins, do you take the position that the OPA and... what is it... section 1018--"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1767.77,1768.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1768.471,1773.133,--amended the PWSA in some way?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1773.133,1775.234,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.234,1790.365,How... how is it possible then that that section has any effect on any preemption affected by PWSA or the other... or PTSA?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1790.365,1799.51,"Justice O'Connor, our position is that the outcome of this case would be the same even if section 1018 had not been enacted, but we--"
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.51,1806.255,Do you defend the treatment given by the Ninth Circuit to the OPA section?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1806.255,1818.534,"--Well, I think the Ninth Circuit correctly observed that the... section 1018 we believe is an exclamation point indicating Congress' intent not to preempt State regulation in this area."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.966,1856.221,It's very hard to understand how the Ninth Circuit ruling comports with what we said in Ray.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1858.631,1861.593,"Oh, yes, Ray is good law and we rely on Ray heavily."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1910.768,1921.894,"Well, I... I thought there was language in the Ray opinion that title II has twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1921.894,1923.474,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.474,1933.381,And... and there certainly is language in those statutes dealing with the manning of vessels and vessel safety.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1933.381,1934.012,Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.171,1960.329,"Well, it... it appeared, at least to me, to look to those areas where Congress required the Coast Guard to make regulations."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1960.329,1961.471,"Well, Your Honor--"
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1961.471,1964.842,"And as to that, I don't see what room is left."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1967.485,1983.424,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I think... I think that that is not the correct reading of Ray because the Court was very... I mean, for example, operations is listed in title II, but the Court was very careful in Ray to distinguish design and construction from other kinds of requirements."
1999.98-1701,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.175,2006.328,"But they also invalidated, didn't they, the requirement that tankers carry State licensed pilots?"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2010.242,2012.753,--For the coast-wise trade.
1999.98-1701,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.756,2018.236,"So... so, Ray was not limited to design and construction."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2031.066,2050.498,"--Your Honor, I believe that in Ray the... the pilotage requirement for the coast-wise trade was struck down because of a specific pilotage statute enacted by Congress and... and that's in fact why the requirement for a pilot for the registered vessels was... was upheld because of a specific statute."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.429,2072.152,Is... is it right that you've now given up on the Ninth Circuit?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2084.5,2085.732,"--Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.732,2085.889,All right.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2094.929,2095.981,"I take your point, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.98,2097.38,Okay.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2184.268,2188.64,"Well, my response to that is that that wasn't the analysis in Ray, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.76,2235.341,A little ambiguity.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2251.091,2252.252,"Well, I'm not--"
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.252,2259.646,"And you... now you're going to say even if the Secretary does issue a regulation, still there is not necessarily preemption."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2259.646,2261.797,"--Not necessarily field preemption, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.79,2282.471,"Now, you... you also disavow that part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2287.174,2287.845,"--Well, I think--"
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.845,2291.687,"--because there's no... no preemptive authority for the regulations, if I... if I read the opinion correctly."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2291.687,2298.812,"--Justice Stevens, are you speaking of the... the express... their... their discussion about the Coast Guard's statements of express preemption?"
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.812,2299.383,Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2299.383,2299.784,Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.096,2306.059,They didn't analyze any of the regulations--
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2306.059,2306.266,--No.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.266,2311.862,--because they said the Coast Guard had no authority to issue regulations that would preempt State law.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2311.862,2319.406,"See, I think that... I think that that is a characterization of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that is not quite accurate."
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.996,2324.758,It fully explains why they didn't pay any attention to what the regulations said.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2325.86,2326.231,--The--
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.231,2332.814,"--having concluded that the Coast Guard was acting outside its delegated authority, insofar as it tried to preempt."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2332.814,2333.565,--It--
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.565,2335.575,That's what I... I thought the opinion was quite clear.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2335.575,2347.205,"--It seems to me, Your Honor, that what the Ninth... in the action below, as Mr. Benner said, their fall-back argument was that some regulations were expressly preempted by the Coast Guard."
1999.98-1701,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2383.817,2386.019,But that's what the Ninth Circuit didn't do.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2404.521,2405.142,This case is in a--
1999.98-1701,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.891,2485.415,"Well, but part of... part of my... my point was... was institutional."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2500.285,2518.688,"--So, from our point of view, Your Honor, what we think should happen in this case is the Court should rule that there is no broad field preemption of all of the items that are listed in title II of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act and essentially affirm the result at the Ninth Circuit."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2520.648,2524.439,"I... I mean, you're saying that you should hold them to some kind of waiver."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2553.159,2557.711,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think of it so much as... as an issue of waiver."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.711,2560.713,"Well, you were just saying they hadn't put in the evidence--"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2560.713,2560.953,Well--
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2560.953,2565.097,--and they didn't... they didn't take in the international significance of this.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2572.522,2594.936,"--But it... it's... what I would direct you to, I guess, is this Court's decision in Askew where one of the questions in Askew was whether the State of Florida could require certain kinds of equipment on the vessel for purposes of response, and the Court said we're not going to engage in speculation at this point about how this conflict might work out."
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.262,2622.943,"I'm not sure that's quite consistent with the record because at page 30a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, they... they refer to the fact that Intertanko did call attention to several regulations as being expressly preempted by Coast Guard regulations, identified some in the text and some in the footnote."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2630.359,2635.933,"Well, it was brought to the attention of the lower court, Justice Stevens, with Mr. Benner's fall-back argument."
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.494,2639.566,"Certainly, but that fall-back argument is before us."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2639.566,2639.786,--Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.507,2651.172,"And they responded to the argument not by disagreeing on the conflict, but by saying, as I understand it, the preemption by regulations does not occur if the agency is acting beyond the scope of its delegated powers."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2657.397,2664.45,"Well, I think I got... I think I was taken off track when I was responding to your question, so let me try to get back to it."
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.588,2676.628,By virtue of the Coast Guard regulation.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2676.628,2678.271,--By virtue of the declaration.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.271,2680.082,Well.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2680.082,2683.194,"But... well... but I think there's a difference, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.906,2720.038,Congress could do that.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2720.038,2721.239,Congress could do that.
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.239,2725.441,And you're saying that Congress didn't delegate that function to the Coast Guard.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2725.441,2726.603,"Right, for field preemption."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.603,2727.114,Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2727.114,2741.472,"And so... and that's of some concern to us because if that's the rule, then the Coast Guard can eliminate State participation by simply adopting a rule saying we intend that no State shall adopt any rules or regulations pertaining to oil tankers."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.686,2749.467,Congress could delegate that to the Coast Guard if it chose.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2749.467,2756.744,"I think Congress could do that if it... Congress could itself say we intend to exclude the States from this field, and they could--"
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.744,2765.418,"What if Congress said in the... in the delegation of the Coast Guard, we authorize the Coast Guard to determine whether or not the States should be excluded from this field?"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2765.418,2774.264,--I think that would be kind of an express statement that would give the Coast Guard the kind of authority that we do not believe that it has been given.
1999.98-1701,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.264,2788.593,But otherwise you say we should look at title I and... and ask whether the Coast Guard implicitly meant to preclude the States?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2788.593,2789.344,No.
1999.98-1701,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2826.058,2830.081,Is... is uniformity of maritime regulation an important objective?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2830.081,2837.744,"Well, I think that uniformity is a... is... is an important factor in places where uniformity is needed."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2932.667,2935.288,How about the drug testing requirement?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2935.288,2941.333,"Well, Your Honor, the drug testing requirement is one where there is no international standard."
1999.98-1701,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2964.838,2977.618,I would think that would relate directly to manning the vessels in an area where Congress has told the Coast Guard to regulate and the Coast Guard has said what it--
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2977.618,2982.072,"--I would disagree, Your Honor, that that is a manning requirement."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3001.743,3003.313,"--Not on land, I take it."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3003.313,3003.633,--No.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.15,3012.812,"But if the... if the Coast Guard regulation is not a manning requirement, where did they get the authority to regulate it?"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3012.812,3014.422,"Well, on the drug and alcohol one--"
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.422,3014.713,Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3014.713,3027.191,--they actually got that from the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 because there's a specific provision in OPA '90... and I think it's... let's see.
1999.98-1701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.191,3040.681,"You're saying that... that the authority to issue manning regulations would not have authorized them to give... to issue the drug and alcohol regulation, except for the... unless that later statute had been passed."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3042.181,3042.541,No.
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.728,3082.216,"--What about... what about the requirement that says, as they describe it, all licensed deck officers... I guess that means every one... must speak English and speak a language understood by all the crew, which could be 14 different languages."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3094.935,3095.225,"--Well, Your--"
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.225,3098.437,"And it also sounds like a manning requirement and it also doesn't, you know--"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3098.437,3103.001,"--Well, Your Honor, in that situation, we think the Government is simply mistaken."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.717,3129.849,--Was that based on that thing that happened down in New Orleans where... where--
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3129.849,3132.39,"--Oh, where they ran into the shopping center?"
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.39,3132.741,--Yes.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3132.741,3133.191,Well--
1999.98-1701,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3150.473,3166.003,"Getting back to this distinction in drug regulations where it applies to vessels from... I guess American flag vessels and not others, if it's a local regulation, what... what authority does the State have to make a distinction for its regulations depending on the origins of... of the ship?"
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3169.804,3170.415,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3198.154,3200.095,Just as long as it's foreign flag.
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3205.347,3205.687,No.
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3205.687,3206.899,Or everybody has to speak French?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3206.899,3207.42,No.
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.42,3209.231,What are they saying?
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3209.231,3214.684,The requirement is the officers have to be able to speak English enough to be able to communicate.
1999.98-1701,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.485,3218.087,"Yes, but I mean, they have, you know, thousands of people."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3230.605,3238.64,"--The deck officers have to be able to speak English, and they also have to be able to speak a common language understood by the crew."
1999.98-1701,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3248.677,3254.431,"Before you do that, you mentioned and you placed considerable reliance on Askew."
1999.98-1701,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3271.962,3288.694,"Your Honor, I think my reference to Askew was a... was to argue that this Court shouldn't just send this back to determine conflict preemption because the conflicts that the Government raises are speculative and weren't raised below, and those are better left for another day."
1999.98-1701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3429.616,3431.529,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
1999.98-1701,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3434.618,3436.491,I'd like to make a... a couple of points.
1999.98-1701,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3579.339,3583.339,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick. The case is submitted."
