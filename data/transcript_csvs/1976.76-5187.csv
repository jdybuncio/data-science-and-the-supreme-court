1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.236,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 76-5187, Lee v. the United States."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,26.489,29.829,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the court.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,102.405,125.122,"He might have made it earlier, Your Honor but in fact as the record indicates he was the second counsel for the petitioner, and he was appointed only seven weeks before the trial and it clearly could have been made earlier but it might not have been reasonable to have done so and there is no contention that the objection here was not timely."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.479,144.88,But my only suggestion is that an attorney who makes a motion that late in the game may well find a trial judge unprepared to pass on it at the particular moment that he makes it.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,144.88,155.547,"Your Honor, I think there were two responses to that inquiry: One, in certain circumstances the time may be so late that it would be difficult for the judge to rule."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.995,188.233,What was going on?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,190.211,190.759,"No, Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.828,198.031,"Well, wasn't the Court about to commence the hearing of testimony then?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,198.031,208.176,What had happened Your Honor was that the case had been called; the prosecution had made its opening statement which lasted all of about 45 seconds.
1976.76-5187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.55,225.965,"First of all, could not he make the objection before the opening statement on the part of counsel?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,225.965,229.391,It is not clear from the procedure whether he could have.
1976.76-5187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,257.45,260.582,"So, what is your position that jeopardy have not attached?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,260.582,273.953,"Well, the Court in the Serfass case says that in a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is in paneled and that in a non-jeopardy case, jeopardy attaches when evidence commences."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,300.357,305.176,"And petitioner’s counsel did absolutely nothing, he did not object."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,305.176,306.664,"Well, Your Honor the --"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.664,312.69,"You said that the judge could have gone out and looked at the case right quick, he did not suggest that to the judge, did he?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,312.69,313.512,What petitioner’s --
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,313.512,318.241,He did not do anything but filed a motion which he can now use.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,318.241,326.804,It is true Your Honor that he did not say after the motion was denied that the judge should indeed take a recess.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,327.776,329.879,He did not object at all?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,336.856,341.076,"In fact Your Honor, although it is not excuse that the trial counsel."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,358.385,360.891,You mean he did not understand what the judge said?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,360.891,363.081,It would appear so Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.081,368.435,How can a judge raise at a guy who will understand what he says other than to say it?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,368.435,373.913,I said Your Honor; I am not suggesting that that would excuse what petitioner’s counsel did.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.913,380.624,"Well, the record is correct that the judge said specifically, I will pass on this when I get time to look at that?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,380.624,381.507,No question Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.507,384.617,And counsel said nothing?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,384.617,385.395,That is right Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.395,387.772,"Well, could I say he acted (Inaudible)?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,387.772,389.063,I think not Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,389.063,389.648,Why not?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,389.648,401.01,I think that the objection that counsel made to the sufficiency of the information carries with it implicitly the request that the Court will grant a recess and look up the case.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,413.888,417.264,Did he read the -- did he read anything from the case?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,417.264,419.794,He read only the citation to the case Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.794,420.583,That is all?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,420.583,421.165,That is right.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,421.165,422.47,But why did not he read it?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,431.133,431.985,It would Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.553,443.259,"I think one response is that under York (ph) Theory, he can make the motion and then there is no way for him to lose."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,443.259,444.24,I think the other response --
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,444.24,445.322,Am I right?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,445.322,452.401,"That there is no way for him to lose, yes there is a way for him to lose, because it seems to me that in a case like this the Court could --"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,452.401,455.094,"Well, what could the government have done at that stage?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,455.094,457.281,The government had a number of alternatives.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,464.577,465.66,What else?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,465.66,471.659,A second alternative would have been to make a motion under Rule 7(e) to amend the information.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,472.483,474.272,You mean the government could have done?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,474.272,477.869,The government clearly under its Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(e) --
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.869,480.835,"Whose case is this, the government or the defense?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,480.835,490.002,The Court -- the cases in this Court may clear that the responsibility for having a proper trial lies not on the defendant but lies with the prosecution and with court.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.002,492.546,That is why you do not have to object.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,492.546,505.469,It is not a question of not having to object but having objected; having performed its responsibility that if there is any duty the duty already was on the prosecution to Trial Court.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,517.066,521.374,But you have made the same argument if he had not cited the one case.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,521.374,525.756,"I think the argument could also be made, but the citation makes it even --"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.756,530.648,Would you go so far as if he said I think the indictment is insufficient?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,530.648,535.985,"Well, the mere observation like that I think might be insufficient but here we do not have a mere observation."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,539.859,540.859,Written?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,540.859,543.396,An oral motion made in Court.
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,543.396,547.772,Did the government have any advance notice that this motion would be made?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,547.772,549.075,I do not think so Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,549.075,565.627,"Well then prosecution counsel was hardly in a better position to have this -- take one of these alternatives that you have suggested and of course have to decide this issue suddenly presented, is that not so?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,565.627,572.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is true that the prosecution was not given advance notice of the motion."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.869,596.124,"We can accept that without any difficulty, but you are suggesting that this was so clear that everyone should have been able to react right away."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,611.36,613.72,I simply do not know the answer to that Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.711,656.661,"Do you think the defendant’s counsel in Court at that time as an officer of the Court as he is, as you are, had an obligation to suggest to the Court the possibility that delay in acting on that while he proceeded to take testimony might create some serious problems in the administration of justice?"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.401,722.12,"You mean that when a lawyer defends a case lastly, he does not read the information?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,722.12,725.918,It certainly should not be the last thing he does Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.294,730.965,Is that an excuse?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,730.965,734.977,I am not attempting to excuse Mr. Swanson’s conduct.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,778.408,783.997,"But if nobody raised the question, and then he was convicted, he would go to jail, wouldn't he?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,783.997,784.827,"Indeed, he would."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.827,789.231,"So there is a little bit responsibility on the petitioner, a little bit."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,789.231,790.857,There certainly is.
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,802.896,818.156,Mr. Bauer is there anything in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or in the local rules of this District Court or Northern District of Indiana that set a time period within which such a motion could be filed?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,818.156,823.586,The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically provide that the motion is timely at any stage.
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.586,824.16,At any stage.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,824.16,827.853,At any stage.
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.124,851.721,"So, that Rule, in your submission, means that if the motion is made and granted after the taking of any evidence and there is an automatic double jeopardy defense to another trial."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,851.721,853.896,"No, Your Honor that is not our submission."
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.835,924.147,Which is what you tell me the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permit that the motion to be made at anytime before or after jeopardy attaches?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,924.147,925.489,That is right.
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,925.489,934.424,"And if motion was made after jeopardy attaches and has granted, then there is built-in double jeopardy defense to any future trial?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,934.424,937.115,"No, no Your Honor, I think not."
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.338,950.059,"If denied there is no problem, no double jeopardy problem."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,950.059,963.868,"If it is granted at that time, then we do have the situation to which the respondent refer, the Dinitz kind of situation or the Somerville kind of situation, in which one can explain that on one of two grounds."
1976.76-5187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.047,982.281,"But this is not a mistrial, the basis of this motion is that the person should never have been held before the Court on a defective indictment such as this."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,985.321,986.816,"Well, that is indeed true Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.09,1036.617,"For purposes of your argument as to double jeopardy, do you draw any distinction between the declarations of a mistrial on the dismissal of indictment?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1036.617,1048.329,"Your Honor, there is a stronger case for a dismissal because the dismissal as we suggest in the Jenkins case may well be ambivalent and ambiguous."
1976.76-5187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.853,1059.532,Here and clearly it was not a dismissal on the merits.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1059.532,1061.46,Here it was clearly not a dismissal on the merits.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.971,1114.791,But there is still another point; you said he was not then guilty.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1119.296,1125.719,"Indeed, Your Honor, the judge made that observation and there is no way that we can erase that from the record."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.05,1170.772,"Mr. Bauer, would your case be different if Judge Ashba (ph) had made findings effect of guilt and then dismiss the indictment after that?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1173.685,1183.003,"I think if there had been a formal verdict of guilty followed by a dismissal afterwards, our case would be different."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.653,1207.01,"Well, let us take to double jeopardy for the moment."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1215.472,1216.594,Yes.
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.594,1224.546,"It could have been appealed by the government notwithstanding the fact that if the ruling was affirmed, there could be another trial."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1224.546,1226.887,You mean the ruling --
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.887,1232.264,"In other words, say Judge Ashba (ph) had post-verdict, had dismissed that preceding."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1243.487,1244.53,"Yes, they could Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.53,1246.241,And there could be another trial?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1246.241,1247.33,There could be Your Honor.
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.33,1254.621,"Then even though there is a possibility of a second trial raising all the fact questions, double jeopardy would not apply."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1254.621,1263.216,"The reason for that Your Honor was because in your -- the situation which you posit, there was indeed a verdict from which there is an appeal."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.483,1274.239,So the error you really are complaining of then was ground the fact that Judge Ashba (ph) did not make the right findings.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1276.279,1282.094,"No, Your Honor, in this case, there was a continuum of errors."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.969,1288.634,"Well, but that rest entirely on the error being so plain."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1307.427,1318.501,"No, I would not Your Honor, although I would respectfully suggest that what the trial judge should have done was at least declared a five minute recess to determine whether the question was complicated."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.43,1368.556,I just have a lot of difficulty with the notion that the constitution of Double Jeopardy issue turns on the time and the difficulty of the making of the motion.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1368.556,1372.741,"Well, it is not the difficulty of the motion that is the determinant Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.232,1395.799,"Well, it is easy to say that after the fact, but the trial judges who have to go ahead with trials you know, it is not that easy."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1398.655,1404.293,"What was so egregious, why did it take defense counsel seven weeks before he noticed it?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1404.293,1411.086,"Well, Your Honor, I referred to that earlier and I must respectively suggest that I do not know the answer."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1411.086,1416.296,"Well, perhaps then you were mistaken, when you say it is so egregious."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1416.296,1424.387,"Well, one answer may be, he did not look at the information at all as soon as he did look at the information, it leapt from the paper."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.076,1450.761,"If you are correct in your position, perhaps the Criminal Rule should be amended to provide that any motion not made at least to three days before trial is waived, the defect is waived."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1450.761,1456.784,"Your Honor, I would suggest that that would be an inappropriate response."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1511.439,1514.428,It is only a coincidence that this was a bench trial.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1525.785,1529.607,"Well, that would be closer to the Somerville case."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1529.607,1531.195,And the simple jeopardy would have attached.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1531.195,1531.877,That is right.
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1541.275,1545.819,"Well, what would a recess be after jeopardy had attached?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1545.819,1553.947,"Well, if indeed, had the jury been impaneled and the motion was only made at that time --"
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.947,1556.016,I should have said impaneled and sworn.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1556.016,1559.676,"Impaneled and sworn, jeopardy attaches onto the Serfass rule."
1976.76-5187,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1601.89,1614.146,"Mr. Bauer, may I ask you again, how can one be sure that this was not a deliberate bypass when counsel for defendant made no objection to the procedure that judge followed."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1629.946,1638.289,It might have been that the judge thought that counsel was not objecting although there is reason to believe that the counsel misunderstood the Trial Court’s ruling.
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1706.733,1710.27,"Mr. Bauer, why do you consistently say he needed a recess?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1713.649,1714.605,"Okay, they could have argued it right there."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.605,1716.264,Then why did not he?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1716.264,1718.16,"Well, I think the question is why not ask the government?"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1718.16,1719.662,Why did not he?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1719.662,1720.954,Why not ask the government that?
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.954,1720.979,Why did not he?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1720.979,1723.056,Why not ask the judge for that?
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.056,1723.92,It was his motion.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1732.999,1735.854,"Since I was not in that courtroom I cannot tell you, Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.252,1771.478,"Well, I suppose one reason defense counsel might not have pursued it too vigorously was that he would not gain very much if he would be gotten any indictment amended right there in the spot, what does he gain?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1771.478,1778.066,"Well, he gains then the possibility that that case is the only case that the defendant has to sit through."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.277,1781.863,"Well, that under your view of the law, that is true anyway?"
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1781.863,1783.007,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.629,1799.85,Do you admit the information could have been amended?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1799.85,1802.832,"Not only do I admit it, I asked why did not the government do it?"
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.457,1808.575,"So if they had been amended, then your man would be in jail? Good."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1808.575,1811.322,I do not admit that Your Honor because --
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.322,1813.01,You do not admit what the judge said?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1813.01,1814.37,I suggest that the judge --
1976.76-5187,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.37,1816.516,You said he is a guilty man.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1816.516,1841.983,"I suggest that the judge had an outburst of frustration because the judge had let that whole trial go ahead, and the judge recognized, finally he had made a mistake."
1976.76-5187,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.983,1857.851,"One other observation, going back to the posture of defense counsel the commencement of the -- right before evidence was taken, it seems to me that what he did gave him two bites of the apple, because he just sits there with error in the record and there is a verdict against him, he knows he could have it set aside."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1862.484,1864.713,May I respond to that?
1976.76-5187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1929.105,1932.2,Mr. Bauer let me ask you for this question.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1935.643,1936.425,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-5187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1936.425,1949.255,Do you think the case would be any different if it had been a routine federal offense rather than a state offense brought into Federal Court because of the location or the site of the crime?
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1949.255,1963.047,"I can appreciate the difficulty the government that under the Assimilative Crimes Act, there is a responsibility that are not only for knowing the federal statutes but what may sometimes be difficult state statutes."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.487,2057.667,"I am not sure that I am clarified with this point, but since defense counsel was a member of the Bar and an officer of the Court, I am not sure what your answer was when I asked, did he have an obligation as an officer of the Court to alert the judge to the consequences that you now argued for namely, that there would be a double jeopardy before the Judge went ahead."
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2057.667,2062.224,"Your Honor, if he knew it, I have no question but that he should have."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.224,2066.824,I mean this is something he discovered by research after the event too.
1976.76-5187,0,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2066.824,2080.688,"If he found out about it five weeks before trial, and then waited to the day of trial, I suggest that, as Your Honor, I think is implying that that is inappropriate, not only inappropriate but unbecoming an officer of the Court."
1976.76-5187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2114.338,2123.667,Mr. Frey?
1976.76-5187,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2123.667,2127.147,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
