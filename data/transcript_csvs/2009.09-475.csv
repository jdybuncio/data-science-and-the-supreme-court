2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto Company v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al. Mr. Garre."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,8.154,16.343,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Biotech crops have produced enormous benefits for the nation's farmers and consumers."
2009.09-475,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,44.529,56.503,"Mr. Garre, the Respondents argue that we should dismiss the writ here as improvidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain why that isn't the preferred course of conduct."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,106.582,109.368,"--The Court shouldn't, Justice Alito."
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,155.896,170.12,"But Winter didn't involve something -- as I understand, the -- the decision vacated the deregulation order."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,197.187,204.607,--We did appeal the vacatur as well as the injunction which is contained as part of the same judgment.
2009.09-475,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.793,207.893,"However, you haven't in your brief."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,216.397,224.653,"--Well, we -- our argument all along, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the district court, erred in not adopting the government's proposed judgment."
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,237.828,240.262,"You agree that those are two different things, then, right?"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,243.749,246.268,--They are part and parcel of the same judgment.
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,249.47,254.772,"And under the vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,281.255,285.893,"--Well, the district court could have vacated the order in its entirety and send it back to the agency."
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.294,293.913,But the vacatur does that.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,298.715,301.935,--The vacatur was in part.
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,311.491,322.28,So you would say that the injunction is limited only to a decision the agency might make to allow partial planting?
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,322.28,327.751,"--Well -- and importantly, the district court's judgment -- and it's on page 108 of the petition appendix--"
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,327.751,328.267,Right.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,328.267,334.004,"--not only enjoined the planting of Roundup Ready alfalfa, it enjoined the agency from taking interim measures."
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.004,334.387,Right.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,334.387,334.837,--We--
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.837,335.287,Right.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,346.894,347.544,--And that--
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.544,354.048,It's very odd to get an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do something under the APA.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,354.048,356.583,"--Well, I'm not going to disagree with you on that."
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.237,363.953,I'm looking at--
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,363.953,364.587,--in the context of an injunction.
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.587,367.622,--I'm looking at page 58a.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,372.591,374.707,108a.
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.893,395.004,"--Because I thought that the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to spare the people who had already purchased seeds, allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,395.004,405.312,"Planting was allowed until March 30, 2007, and then that alfalfa could be continued to be harvested; seeds would be harvested and maintained separately."
2009.09-475,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.312,424.357,"And is it your position that that gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying, well, now the district judge didn't just replicate in all respects the universe without the regulation; it had some specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far enough?"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,424.757,425.726,Absolutely.
2009.09-475,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.428,431.796,But whose--
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,431.796,445.537,"What authority do you have for the proposition that when a court vacates an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to the agency?"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,445.537,458.078,"--Well, I think this Court's decision in Weinberger involved at least an analogous situation, where the court found a statutory violation of the Clean Water Act."
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,467.748,470.181,"I guess -- Weinberger, of course, involved a statute."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,487.207,493.677,"--And we at the outset at the district court stage, if the -- if the district court had done that, that would have been fine."
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.068,506.618,"Well, then--"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,506.618,507.52,--those interim steps.
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.52,526.399,"--Mr. Garre, I'm looking at the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article."
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,545.626,555.084,"And we know the district court didn't mean that literally, because its own judgment allows the continued planting and harvesting of RRA planted before--"
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.084,556.417,"Well, but I thought--"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,556.417,556.834,--March 2007.
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.834,562.154,--I thought that was just a dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,581.817,588.904,"Well, if it's a regulated article, then there's no use of it allowed at all unless the agency is granting exceptions."
2009.09-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.455,648.638,Hay production out.
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,648.638,656.478,"--When alfalfa is grown for hay, for forage, as opposed to grown for seeds which can then be planted."
2009.09-475,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.767,695.583,--Could you tell me what's the legal error?
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,709.693,709.977,--Sure.
2009.09-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.301,741.66,"Would you explain, Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the Federal law is before the agency engages in an action that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS?"
2009.09-475,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,755.653,763.842,--Federal law and the regulation at 40 C.F.R. 1506.1(a) allows action to go forward where there's not an adverse environmental impact.
2009.09-475,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.983,777.601,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,788.474,796.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like first to address briefly Justice Alito's question about the length of time that the agency anticipates the EIS will take."
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,851.012,862.419,"Could you go to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners'."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,871.075,873.127,That's correct.
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,873.127,873.46,All right.
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,876.745,884.066,"When the district court issued its summary judgment ruling, it asked the parties to propose their own forms of a judgment."
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.095,936.682,"You have the burden to establish your entitlement to those conditions that are short of a remand, correct?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,936.682,953.127,"I don't think it would have been our burden; that is, if the -- if the order had simply been -- the deregulation order had simply been vacated and remanded to the agency, and the agency had then performed the analysis that's reflected in the Hoffman declarations and said we are putting in place a complete deregulation--"
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,953.127,953.393,"Sure, sure."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,954.543,955.245,--Agencies can do that.
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.797,963.649,"Well, sure, because -- but here the question is whether the court can do that."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,976.806,979.008,"--I think in the ordinary course, you're absolutely correct."
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1003.39,1010.877,"Well, you're short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is required, the reason we send this to an agency, because they are expert and all that."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1016.848,1026.155,"--Well, it is certainly acting with the benefit of whatever information it received in the form of public comment in its original environmental assessment for the complete deregulation."
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.046,1058.71,"Could you have -- let's just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the district court?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1058.71,1073.552,"--Our view is that, first, that we would not have had to go through public notice and comment, because, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(2), there is an exception for good cause, and here the relatively limited timeframe that we were talking about in our view would have constituted good cause."
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.566,1113.111,"Can -- when you -- can you stop right there, because I thought the law was, government agency, before you engage on a major activity, EIS first, and then you can have a deregulation order?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1113.111,1128.704,"--I think that's -- it is correct to say that, as a matter of the statute and the regulations, an agency cannot decide to prepare an EIS on a particular act, decision, and then implement that very decision during the pendency of the EIS."
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1128.704,1129.137,"Yes, that's what I thought."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1129.137,1143.546,"But our -- our core point here is that what we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing continued planting subject to various protective measures, was fundamentally different from the action on which the EIS was being prepared."
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.03,1152.902,"But as far as the court is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an EIS was required."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1176.184,1177.701,--You are correct.
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1234.954,1248.195,"Do you -- do you agree that when you're talking about the elements of the injunction that are short of remand to the agency, that the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet the injunction standards with respect to those?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1258.069,1260.855,--I hope I didn't misunderstand the question.
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.859,1276.781,"No, I'm talking to the -- about the types of activities that would be prohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated it, which is everything -- you can't plant."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1276.781,1283.368,"--No, I think in order for the -- the plaintiffs to get an injunction against those, they would have had to meet--"
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1283.368,1285.386,I guess my point is they don't need an injunction.
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1298.611,1321.791,"--Well, I think if this had happened through the alternative events -- course of events that I discussed previously; that is, if the matter had been remanded back to the agency and the agency had issued an administrative order that embodied these proposed protective conditions, then the plaintiffs would presumably have either filed a new lawsuit or challenged this within the confines of this suit."
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1326.844,1328.213,But you short-circuited that.
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1334.034,1335.234,"--Well, I think--"
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1335.234,1338.486,The district court vacated the deregulation.
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1359.749,1371.39,"--Well, all that the court had decided up to the point when we submitted our proposed judgment was that an EIS was needed before the agency could implement complete deregulation."
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.877,1456.293,So that's the legal error you identify?
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1456.293,1457.493,--That's the legal error we identify.
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1476.354,1491.864,"Do you agree -- would you agree that if the district court had just said the deregulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that would be okay?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1498.017,1501.402,"--I think the district court could have done that and, as I say, if -- if the--"
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.402,1523.918,"And all, it seems to me, that the district court did do in addition to that is to say that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds that are -- that have already been purchased may be planted prior to March 30, 2007."
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1523.918,1524.235,--If it--
2009.09-475,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1524.235,1526.037,It's the only exception.
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1526.037,1527.203,--It didn't just say that.
2009.09-475,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.911,1571.148,And in your view the correctness of that ruling has been preserved in the questions presented to this Court?
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1571.148,1573.398,"Yes, I think -- yes, I think absolutely."
2009.09-475,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.154,1621.478,"That's a little different than answering Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Did you preserve the issue that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from further deregulation?"
2009.09-475,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1631.915,1640.337,"I'm not sure to what extent the Petitioners or -- or the government, frankly, have focused precisely on that particular language of the district court's judgment."
2009.09-475,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1695.071,1696.423,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1703.677,1711.349,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In our view, Petitioners lack standing to bring this case to this Court."
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.426,1757.294,"So if the injunction doesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1757.294,1769.519,"Well, we're -- we're defending it on the alternative ground, Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not persuaded you on our threshold question that there -- that there is a lack of standing."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.563,1789.865,"Mr. Robbins, can I ask you about your clients' standing?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1810.196,1820.551,"Well, the answer is that there are a great many plaintiffs who put in declarations, litigated this issue, and prevailed, and there was no appeal from it."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.25,1843.834,What?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1844.55,1844.936,--From--
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.936,1848.471,"--From somebody within 5 miles, 10 miles, 20 miles?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1848.471,1849.971,"--Well, we have to be clear, Your Honor."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.006,1889.346,"So you want the Court to assume that somebody is going to be planting a field of the genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles of--"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1889.346,1890.596,Well--
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.596,1891.996,--one of your named plaintiffs?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1891.996,1892.381,--Well--
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.381,1909.224,"The fact is there isn't a single named plaintiff who -- who has -- has any claim that within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at risk currently."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1909.224,1911.009,"--Well, let me be clear."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.044,1915.377,I understand that.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1918.412,1918.896,--That's correct.
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.896,1920.046,--who is concretely harmed.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1920.046,1930.918,"And we've put in declarations in the district court, multiple declarations from those members and from Mr. Geertson, the seed -- conventional seed farmer from Idaho, and Mr. Trask from South Dakota."
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1937.758,1953.1,"Am I factually correct that the harm is that from some seed-grown alfalfa, a bee or the wind is going to take the pollen and put it into a conventional field?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1953.1,1955.067,That is one of the risks.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1957.069,1960.004,But is that -- am I right?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1960.004,1960.537,--Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1962.789,1968.257,How many States grow alfalfa to seed as opposed to letting it just grow into hay?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1968.257,1973.645,--Most of the seed production is in the -- is in the Pacific Northwest and the West.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.013,1979.715,So that handful of States--
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1979.715,1980.131,Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1980.131,1981.931,--is that where the risk exists?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1981.931,1982.215,No.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1992.023,1999.86,"You just said the word ""different levels and different degrees"", but this is an all-size-fit injunction."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1999.86,2000.378,Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2001.761,2009.234,So how is that reasonable when the risk is different depending on the place and type of growth?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2009.234,2013.452,"--Well, there are different kinds of risks."
2009.09-475,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2053.86,2054.276,Could I ask you something?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2063.716,2064.466,--They often do.
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.081,2097.27,You -- you don't think the free market would produce companies that advertise: We only cut natural seed fields?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2097.27,2098.537,--Well--
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.537,2099.503,You don't think that would happen?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2100.639,2106.459,"--Well, the -- well, the record, Justice Scalia, before the district court does not tell us one way or the other, but the--"
2009.09-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.459,2126.088,"Mr. Robbins, is it -- is it relevant to that, that in the case of other genetically engineered crops -- sugar beets, for example, soybeans -- that the plantings became overwhelmingly the genetically engineered, rather than the organic or natural?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2126.088,2145.251,"--Well, I think it's relevant to one of the categories of harms that we think is cognizable for purposes of an injunction, and that is the effect on consumer choice and producer choice to be in a non-GMO business."
2009.09-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.151,2151.655,"I mean, in response to Justice Scalia's point of how many now, how many at this moment?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2163.361,2169.45,"--Oh, it's -- it's -- not only, Justice Ginsburg, is it not pulled out of thin air, we're taking their word for it."
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2181.507,2182.44,Just -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2184.123,2188.075,"--No, from a range of contaminating sources."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.344,2191.927,I am really losing you now.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2206.787,0.0,"--Well, no; I'm talking about acreage, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.472,0.0,All right.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2214.507,2214.874,Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.874,2215.959,--genetically engineered seed.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2215.959,2216.426,Correct.
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.426,2220.411,He's not talking about how many unwilling farmers are going to have infected fields.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2220.411,2221.863,"No, I -- I understand."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.863,2222.396,Okay.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2222.396,2223.163,But the -- but the--
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.163,2224.315,"Well, I'm not sure we understood."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2224.682,2236.372,--But I took -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to be asking: What was the -- the relevant risk that the district court had to consider for purposes of irreparable harm?
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.489,2325.078,"But that -- there's a flip side of that that is not so good for you, because one of the things you want from the injunction is a prohibition on the agency partially deregulating."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2334.433,2348.127,"I -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, there is some considerable force to the point that the injunction in that respect exceeded the scope of the vacatur."
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2368.956,2374.677,So your argument is that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing up the vacatur and the injunction?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2374.677,2377.879,--I would put it slightly differently.
2009.09-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.832,2424.191,But isn't one of the reasons that they litigated the injunction was that by its terms and because of its issuance the agency on remand could not have adopted some partial measures to allow controlled planting?
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2424.191,2425.293,--Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2432.778,2439.015,"But -- no, but isn't that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers, Monsanto, contested the injunction?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2450.823,2482.961,"--There is -- that's doubtless one reason why they litigated the injunction, but it is not a reason, Justice Kennedy, that they have standing, because vacating the current injunction will give them nothing that they -- that they -- that isn't already prohibited by the vacatur, except -- and I grant you this -- it will allow them to go back to the agency, seek a partial deregulation, which Mr. Stewart told--"
2009.09-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2482.961,2484.327,But that -- but that is substantial.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2491.564,2492.564,"--Well, I'm not--"
2009.09-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.564,2493.516,Or at least that's their argument.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2493.516,2505.156,"--That is their argument, but it isn't right, and here's why: One of the standing requirements is imminence, that it must be an actual harm or an imminent harm."
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2527.27,2538.128,"I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but they've already done an EA in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori for partial."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2538.128,2539.862,"--Well, we don't know."
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.571,2565.527,"It seems to me pretty doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court and said: This kind of partial deregulation ought to be allowed, and we're in favor of it."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2573.549,2574.332,Right.
2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.332,2579.936,"I mean -- I'd -- you know, I -- boy, I'd take a remand to the agency any day."
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2579.936,2608.669,"Well, I can -- I can tell you, Your Honor, maybe the best authority I could give you on how imminent this is, how -- whether it really meets this Court's standings tests, here's what Petitioners said about this exact scenario when they were in the court of appeals: They said that the prospect of a future grant of partial deregulation is, quote, NEPA controversy> [""], end quote, that, quote,"
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.596,2628.333,"Could I go back to something you said a while ago, that ""likely"" does not mean more likely than not?"
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2628.333,2628.783,Yes.
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2628.783,2630.619,It's -- I thought that would be obvious.
2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2635.504,2648.68,"Well, I -- I -- you know, I think the -- the answer is contextual, but in this context, Mr. Chief Justice, has I think never been understood to mean more likely than not."
2009.09-475,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2648.68,2654.067,Do you have -- I -- I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided over the however many years we've had this standard.

2009.09-475,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2875.821,2884.593,"Well, I think history remains to be written about what will happen in response to that draft EIS that's a year away."
2009.09-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2888.931,2899.622,"But I think you yourself told us how it came out with other crops, that the genetically engineered crop was very popular and took over."

2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.514,2941.782,And what happened with corn?

2009.09-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.022,3387.723,They also said stuff which suggests that they didn't do it.

2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3533.518,3535.601,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-475,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3568.172,3580.813,I have a real problem if the whole appeal is over whether or not the district court should have accepted the agency's views.
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3601.54,3602.29,"Well, it--"
2009.09-475,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3602.29,3613.265,"So how can we say that the district court acted improperly, when it's the government who is asking the district court to forgive it from doing something it's legally required to do?"
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3613.265,3617.967,--The district court at least acted improperly in enjoining the agency from doing that on remand.
2009.09-475,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3620.002,3620.219,"No, no."
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3623.721,3624.637,"--Well, it's part--"
2009.09-475,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3624.637,3634.094,I see only the argument that it erred by not accepting something that the government had no power to do outside of the regulatory scheme.
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3634.094,3636.71,--It's -- our view is it's part and parcel of the vacatur order.
2009.09-475,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3643.366,3643.366,How do you answer Mr. Robbins's--
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3643.366,3645.216,"I mean, it's important for this Court to set aside--"
2009.09-475,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3645.216,3645.499,--I'm sorry to interrupt.
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3647.901,3654.305,"--In terms of going back for the imminence, we're operating under this injunction which is unlawful."
2009.09-475,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3666.695,3673.516,But wouldn't it be the same problem for the farmers if we had only the deregulation decision vacated?
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3679.353,3683.74,"--If you go back, the agency could allow those measures to be implemented and that would solve--"
2009.09-475,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3683.74,3684.357,And that's going to take time.
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3684.357,3684.357,--our problem.
2009.09-475,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3684.357,3691.011,"I mean, it's going to take time, and you have the EIS on track within a year."
2009.09-475,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3694.796,3700.2,"Not necessarily, Justice Ginsburg, but, with respect, we've been operating under this erroneous injunction for 3 years."
2009.09-475,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3725.862,3726.129,"Thank you, counsel."
