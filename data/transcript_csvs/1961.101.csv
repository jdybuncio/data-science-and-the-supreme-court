1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,17.432,28.524,"In submission to Your Honors, this Honorable Court has granted a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit."
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,293.509,295.764,But what about the defendant's time?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,295.764,298.596,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,339.06,339.716,"Mr. Rome, may I --"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,339.716,340.007,Sir.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,340.007,352.072,-- may I ask if -- if this action had been commenced in New York with all of the defendants properly deemed there?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,352.072,352.672,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,352.672,353.238,They would have been.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,353.238,353.514,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,373.305,373.68,Yes go ahead.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,373.68,384.164,-- because GoldLawr Incorporated is a Pennsylvania corporation which owns and operates the Erlanger Theatre in the City of Philadelphia.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,491.757,496.744,"Before you go to the case, don't you think it would be desirable to read the statute and in fact, you read it again?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,496.744,499.213,Of course sir.
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,667.175,674.947,"But Mr. Rome, what are the practical consequences of this view, assuming the Court of Appeals' decision stands?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,674.947,680.572,"The practical consequences of this Your Honor pleases, is the following."
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,680.572,681.05,(Inaudible)
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,681.05,702.094,That the petitioner is now in the predicament of being unable to pursue a substantial part of his claim against these dismissed defendants because of the fact that we will have lost the benefit of the tolling statute -- of the tolling of the statute of limitations.
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,742.741,745.191,You're not barred absolutely by limitation?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,745.191,746.767,No sir.
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,746.767,748.932,But the amount of your damage isn't cut down in effect?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,748.932,759.604,The amount of damage is cut down substantially sir and we say that it is not really in the interest of justice to permit this situation to happen.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,780.811,783.845,Why were you thrown out in Philadelphia?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,783.845,809.691,We were thrown out as to these defendants Mr. Justice Frankfurter because Judge Kraft following a deliberation and consideration of the problem for 18 months concluded that there were not sufficient context as to these defendants to warrant the application of Section 12 of the Clayton Act so as to permit service to be had as to these defendants but --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,809.691,813.6,But you brought proceedings contemporaneously both in New York and Philadelphia?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,813.6,815.893,"It could have been done, yes sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,863.414,870.441,"But you don't suggest that -- that the judges in Philadelphia did nothing during those 18 months except to handover this problem, do you?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,870.441,878.286,I do not have the temerity to suggest sir that Judge Kraft in the busy Eastern District of Pennsylvania was devoting his time exclusively to this matter.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,878.286,885.982,"You're dissenting -- you made two or three references to good faith, must have transferee court determine whether there were good faith or not?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,885.982,892.637,I think that is it a necessary heart of the determination of the transferor court because in the interest of --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,892.637,895.097,I heavily chose my words.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,895.097,910.255,"I am aware of that sir and I'm not trying to avoid answering Your Honor's question but it seems to me that initially, there should be recognition given by the transferee court to the determination made by the transferor court."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.516,952.019,"I know but the purpose of -- or the reason for my question was that if you open the door to the transferee court to determine whether or not the error and -- and the feelings of the wrong jurisdiction as a good faith error, that to me is not very appealing factor, perhaps to take into account to construe this kind of a jurisdictional or procedural -- jurisdictional or procedural statute."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,952.019,961.167,I make reference to it Mr. Justice Frankfurter because it would appear that since the statute does think in terms of interest of justice.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,961.167,962.512,But what's transferor court?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,962.512,964.119,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,964.119,971.82,"Certainly, he must -- I suppose he must take into account or others relevant that to determine whether in the interests of justice."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,971.82,973.872,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,975.212,978.161,"Well, that was the approach that Judge Hincks took in dissent."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,978.161,979.849,Indeed.
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,979.849,995.354,"He said that the abuses, that the majority appeared if your construction was adopted where impart offended against by the fact that the transferor court would be thought there was not good faith, whatever you want to call it but denying the interest of justice transfer."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,995.354,996.643,Indeed Mr. Justice Harlan.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,996.643,1005.583,"What kind of -- what kind of consideration entered to whether into the issue of good faith in this connection, the private consideration?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1005.583,1019.996,The question of whether it seems to me the plaintiff was shopping improvidently for a jurisdiction whether he had or had not any reasonable basis to suppose that the court --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1019.996,1025.209,But this is -- if the transferor judge called witnesses and cross-examined?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1025.209,1025.654,No sir.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1025.654,1027.405,The counsel said that he would make it.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1029.445,1029.603,But --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1029.603,1030.76,-- lies behind this.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1030.76,1059.665,"But there was presented to the judge in the transferor court a variety of evidence emanating out of affidavits and depositions with regard to the matter so that it was able to make a determination not in a vacuum, not based upon facts in limbo and indeed not based upon a failure of the defendants to have their day in court and present argument against the possibility of transfer."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1100.442,1111.154,"There considerations, the state law claiming -- I don't mean state procedural law, the state substantive law, any -- any (Inaudible) problem entered into this (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1111.154,1112.386,"I would think not, Your Honor."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1112.386,1114.387,"But in -- in a diversity case, they would."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1114.387,1115.057,Yes sir but --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1115.057,1117.413,"Not in your case, not in a federal right case."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1117.413,1117.974,I think not in this.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1117.974,1120.96,"Under the diversity case, you'd have nothing but state law."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1120.96,1121.818,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1121.818,1133.523,"And therefore, there might be -- counsel might take or join this view of what -- what state laws in one state as again state law in another state."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1134.649,1136.397,"That might be true, Your Honor."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1144.938,1161.418,"You mean that the transferor court, the opposing counsel would say, Well, Your Honor, it's perfectly plain that suit was sought to be the jurisdiction or venue was sought to be satisfied in the state X because state X is content of law."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1169.605,1180.099,That kind of thing would -- and in my judgment Your Honor inevitably would be brought to the attention of the judge in the transferor court.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1308.922,1314.69,I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure I understand you but appreciate at least your argument.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1322.346,1331.92,"As to corporate defendants, it would seem to me -- to be so sir because the necessary requirements to --"
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1331.92,1343.87,"But the other way around for the corporation sue an individual, you get very different situation as to -- different elements give venue to a large extent in the federal court."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1368.055,1371.486,Essentially sir because in this specific case --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1371.486,1374.228,I'm not talking about this case because you can justify this case.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1374.228,1375.297,"No, of course not, Your Honor."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1375.297,1381.423,And it might be so with reference to -- to corporations in light of the Shoe case et cetera.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1388.643,1398.646,"No, but they are the one sir as to whom this problem it would appear more usually arises."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1399.77,1402.112,You mean an individual suing a corporation?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1402.112,1402.381,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1402.381,1411.033,"And therefore, the corporation is amenable by some tenuous connection with the locality and that gives venue, is that it?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1411.033,1413.559,Yes sir.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1413.559,1420.427,You're making a lot assumptions I think that this statute was passed with reference to litigation by corporate plaintiffs.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1420.427,1431.855,"No, I do not for a moment suggest that to be so but the report and the consideration given to the legislation at the time of its passage does make reference to it."
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1609.722,1613.349,What is the weight of decision in the lower court?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1613.349,1642.678,"The decisions in the lower court, sir, I am bound to say represented element of confusion.But it would appear in my mind clear that the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, the Fourth Circuit indeed earlier decisions within the Second Circuit, earlier decisions of the District Court in the Third Circuit would support the transfer without the necessity of having acquired personal jurisdiction."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1642.678,1644.559,How many circuits have passed on?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1651.688,1652.752,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1652.752,1654.565,That means 13 years.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1656.139,1658.709,"The Second, Third and Fourth."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1658.709,1659.438,Only those three?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1659.438,1660.563,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1660.563,1661.695,Has it arisen in others.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1661.695,1663.716,"No, it would appear not to if there wasn't accept --"
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1663.716,1666.353,What about District Courts?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1666.353,1672.677,"It has arisen in, to my best recollection sir, five District Courts --"
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1672.677,1674.641,Most side of those circuits?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1674.641,1678.889,"No, most of them are within those circuits actually, sir."
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1716.178,1719.552,"Well, Judge Parker's decision was in admiralty case whether or not --"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1719.552,1720.401,It was --
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1720.401,1721.951,-- distinguishable or not.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1721.951,1723.153,It was an admiralty case --
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1723.153,1727.885,And then there are a group of cases that go under 1404.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1727.885,1728.563,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1728.563,1731.38,"Which are against him, aren't they on them all?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1731.38,1732.269,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1797.747,1806.873,Mr. Rome may I ask where the District Courts in acting under 1406 refusing to transfer?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1818.961,1824.88,"I think Your Honor would find, there are two cases that really --"
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1824.88,1826.63,I'm not talking about our immediate problem.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1831.131,1831.154,Yes.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1831.154,1832.781,1406?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1832.781,1839.649,"I think sir, that there would be only two cases that would touch upon what Your Honor has in mind."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1864.247,1867.467,Well I don't -- I'm not sure if you're talking about the same thing (Voice Overlap).
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1867.467,1869.644,"Forgive me, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1869.644,1878.172,Whether the interest -- in the interest of justice that's for the District Court to -- to marshal massive considerations for and -- gone.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1878.172,1878.645,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1878.645,1884.632,"Now, as the Second Circuit directed the District Court, what considerations are irrelevant for that?"
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1884.632,1888.84,"I cannot say, Your Honor that there is any decision."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1888.84,1894.138,How often do you happen to know whether these motions have any kind of frequency --
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1894.138,1894.795,It would appear --
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1894.795,1896.817,-- in commercial district?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1896.817,1908.841,It would appear Your Honor from the number of cases that we have found and which are cited on our brief and also in Mr. Phillips' brief that this is a situation that does arise with some frequency.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1908.841,1912.331,"Cases without a recent opinion, disposition."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1912.331,1919.489,"In some instances, not even reported decisions in other instances, merely the entry of an order of transfer."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1919.489,1921.51,What did Judge Van Dusen do?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1921.51,1930.515,Judge Van Dusen granted the order of transfer even though there had been no personal jurisdiction in that case.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1936.988,1938.649,That he can't do it?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1938.649,1948.335,"Well, it doesn't say that it can't be done, sir except by implication referring to it as an admiralty case which was based on Internatio which in turn was an admiralty case."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1948.335,1951.953,Did Judge Van Dusen reason -- give a reasoned opinion?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1951.953,1954.416,"In my judgment sir, a very reasoned opinion."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1954.416,1961.998,What is the citation?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1961.998,1972.326,That is -- I didn't know sir.
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1972.613,1973.071,Don't bother.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1973.729,1974.218,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1974.218,1975.15,What's the name of the case?
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1975.15,1981.951,"Orszulak, Your Honor."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1995.208,1996.268,"Don't take your time, Mr. Rome."
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1996.268,1997.355,"Forgive me, sir."
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1997.355,1998.109,I'll find it.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1998.109,2006.228,It is a recent decision just shortly before the decision of the Circuit Court in the Hohensee case.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2014.364,2015.1,What is the name of that case?
1961.101,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2015.1,2016.242,I don't get --
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,2016.242,2019.148,Orszulak -- O-R-S-Z-U-L-A-K
1961.101,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2019.148,2025.889,I don't see it in your index.
1961.101,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,2025.889,2035.517,It is found sir in 168 Federal Supplement at 15.
1961.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2070.79,2072.472,"Oh, Mr. Phillips I beg your pardon."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2072.472,2082.266,"With permission of Your Honors, I should like to dispose of two side issues to begin with."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.103,2128.333,"This transfer was made on Judge Kraft's own motion, was it?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2128.333,2129.46,"Yes -- no, sir."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.789,2132.58,The plaintiff filed a motion.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2132.58,2133.821,"The plaintiff filed the motion, sir."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.821,2137.295,"In response to your motion to dismiss, is that it?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2137.295,2139.24,You can hardly say it was in response.
1961.101,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2217.957,2230.979,"Or should we take the statute on its face read it literally it isn't evident this compelling -- it compels wanted to take your view of the case, is it?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2230.979,2234.296,"Well, I should like to get to that point because that is my view."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2393.231,2396.191,"Well, you could have -- correct me."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2405.255,2420.085,I think that I could today because Your Honors very recently amended 54 (b) to provide that an interlocutory appeal maybe permitted where the decision involves some but less than all of the parties.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2420.085,2421.535,If the district --
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2421.535,2423.546,If the District Court approved it but in those --
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2423.546,2426.544,"This preceded that rule, just preceded that thing."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2426.544,2427.021,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2446.611,2448.503,We have it in -- in this very case.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2448.503,2448.834,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2643.85,2651.019,That's because you're unfair to the statute of Philadelphia because to my knowledge not a few have shows that first tried out in Philadelphia to see it.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2651.019,2651.81,"Yes, sir -- but they come --"
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2651.81,2653.691,But they didn't survive in New York.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2653.691,2663.077,They come -- they are generated in New York where the producers are that's where they rehearsed and then they send them to New Haven or Wilmington or Philadelphia for tryouts.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2663.341,2665.333,Well most sophisticated audiences.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2665.333,2674.691,"Oh, well at least they don't -- they are better if Your Honor pleases on first nights because they don't boo and walkout on the first night."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.843,2825.363,"Well, are there any considerations given or any discussion of the possibility had in the District Court of Philadelphia about transferring the entire case to this other district of New York?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2825.363,2832.363,"I would have been delighted sir, but we were caught there as to one or two defendants and couldn't get away and that it's there."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.226,2835.493,"So far as you know, the District Judge didn't consider that alternative?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2835.493,2836.517,He wasn't asked to sir.
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2836.517,2837.123,That was that.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2837.123,2848.026,I was in no position to do it and the plaintiff never did because the struggle has been to maintain this inequality of distance from Philadelphia to New York.
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.1,2855.106,"This is a -- this is a conspiracy I suppose, isn't it?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2855.106,2855.478,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.478,2867.655,"And alleged conspiracy by several defendants and if the -- if the petitioner prevails here, how would you imagine that the litigation will proceed, that one of courts would (Voice Overlap) on the other."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2867.655,2877.094,"Well if the petitioner prevails that this -- this -- this case to be on recall now, it split into two places."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.757,2894.088,"It could, however, in New York."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2894.088,2895.226,"Oh yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2896.257,2905.96,"Now, the case could therefore been transferred in New York, although you say not as to your (Voice Overlap) originally brought in New York."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2905.96,2914.017,Nobody asked the court to transfer this case to New York under Section 1404.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2937.554,2947.193,"How about the other way around Mr. Phillips, sending your -- your duly served Philadelphia clients to New York, is there any power, has anybody thought?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2947.193,2947.442,"Oh yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2947.442,2948.731,Under -- under what?
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2948.731,2951.629,"Section 1404, convenience."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2951.629,2952.742,There is more convenience.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2952.742,2953.288,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2954.475,2958.702,"And when you think you are in no position, that's why I was wondering?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2961.208,2965.952,I was suggesting as to the defendants that are involved here.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2969.467,2973.156,"But you just said a little while ago, that's the reason I asked the question."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2978.605,2979.063,"No, Sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2984.255,2984.907,The Court?
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,2984.907,2993.18,"-- and actually, I proposed we've given no consideration with the client but I proposed to ask that the case be transferred to New York."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3005.364,3018.626,"I should think in the interest of justice, afraid of deficiency, well it's not fully unlimited in the judicial -- judicial interest must have interest relevant or judicial judgment must be taken into account."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3031.81,3033.437,"Oh I think so, if Your Honor pleases."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3320.521,3325.845,"And perhaps Mr. Phillips, both you and I are bound by Hoffman and Blaski (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3325.845,3327.741,"Well, I certainly am if Your Honor pleases."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3327.741,3334.762,It's got it in -- well -- you'll start with that in -- in full deference to it.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3338.389,3341.146,"Oh I get a -- I get a great deal of comfort, if Your Honor please."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3344.389,3344.727,Yes.
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3344.727,3356.414,And the court there was asked to consider 1404 as a remedial statute and broadly construe it beyond the content of its words.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3373.163,3380.055,"Well, but the -- the situation of the two if the two sections deal with a very different -- are different, aren't they?"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3380.055,3380.477,"Oh, they're --"
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3380.477,3380.483,It's --
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3380.483,3381.11,-- quite different.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3381.11,3388.915,"-- quite different because in Hoffman-Blaski, you've got a court that has jurisdictions -- there's --"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3388.915,3389.552,-- suppose that I have.
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3389.552,3394.777,"-- no doubt, no doubt that the court could litigate."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3441.231,3441.525,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3441.525,3443.016,"Now here, you got the reverse."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3443.016,3443.679,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3443.679,3461.589,"You got just the reverse namely, that you've got a court which -- which transcribe a case and Congress up to 1948 said if that so, if you've chosen the wrong forum, too bad, lawyers are supposed to be learned people."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3464.229,3465.646,"Yes, sir."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3465.646,3468.534,"But anyhow, they must make a choice on these matters."
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3544.06,3553.32,"I see, I think Your Honor's comment have been pretty much followed by Professor Moore who says that the rule might better have been the other way."
1961.101,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3555.051,3559.893,"The so-called bidding in his four volumes or six, I don't go to him until (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3559.893,3566.84,"Well, I didn't go to him in this case because he doesn't like my decision and commented on it."
1961.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3684.018,3685.145,(Inaudible)
1961.101,1,19755,c_russell_phillips,,3685.145,3688.397,"The Schiller case, Schiller versus Mit-Clip."
1961.101,2,16446,aaron_lipper,,3795.488,3795.891,If Your Honors please --
1961.101,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3795.891,3797.165,Mr. Lipper.
1961.101,2,16446,aaron_lipper,,3797.165,3807.91,"-- in the light of the comment of Mr. Rome to the question of Justice Harlan, I respect in stating that he wasn't interested in our defendant nor respondent."
1961.101,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3822.696,3825.961,Mr. Rome.
1961.101,3,23065,edwin_p_rome,,3825.961,3855.424,I would just ask leave to bring to Your Honors attention the fact that Mr. Phillips said inverted in passing to the conclusion of the court below in the majority opinion about the use of the language and the actual placing of the words of 1406 as being indicative that it was intended only to cure a venue defect.
