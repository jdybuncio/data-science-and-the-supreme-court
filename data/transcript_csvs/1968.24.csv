1968.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,39.204,"Number 24, Federal Trade Commission, petitioner versus Texaco Incorporated et al."
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,40.205,44.306,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.464,270.656,Except in the Atlantic case there was coercion in here --
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,270.656,278.429,"Those -- I'm speaking Mr. Justice of just the economic relationship the first element, the power relationship between the company --"
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.429,278.488,I see.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,278.488,279.129,And the dealers.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.198,281.274,Right.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,281.274,286.519,Explain the differences in the way in which the power was exercised.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.519,288.277,Correct.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,288.277,292.197,Texaco is one of the largest petroleum dealers in the country.
1968.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,484.378,488.628,We'll recess.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,490.952,494.901,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.048,545.499,And they're terminable by either party?
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,545.499,546.362,By either party.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,546.362,555.866,And as I -- then the facts good many of these service station operators are lessees of Texaco.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,555.866,556.334,That is right.
1968.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.334,563.695,But a great many are or at least to some are also lessees of other people and some own their property.
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,563.695,564.288,That's correct.
1968.24,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,710.585,724.198,"Mr. Friedman, may I ask you at this point, is there evidence in the record as to whether any of these stations and of TBA of other manufactures?"
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,724.198,724.315,Oh!
1968.24,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,725.336,729.372,And as the evidence is to how substantial that was?
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,729.372,732.267,It's difficult to say how -- there's no question that they did.
1968.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1121.223,1124.8,"What form does that advertising take you, Mr. Friedman?"
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1124.8,1136.805,"Well, it's advertising -- it varies again, they frequently do advertise the sponsored products and let me say Mr. Chief Justice, we don't claim that this is the only thing in the record."
1968.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1453.302,1455.19,Who was that employee?
1968.24,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1455.19,1468.994,"Mr. Tidwell -- the employee was a Mr. Fitz who had the position of being manager of the Goodyear Bulk Refinery I'm sorry, Goodrich Bulk Refinery in the, I' sorry Texaco Bulk Refinery in the area where he was working."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2363.207,2364.39,Mr. Chief Justice and may it --
1968.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2364.39,2365.026,Mr. Handler.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2365.026,2368.157,Please the Court.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2442.65,2456.222,"Unless Mr. Handler, we thought the Commission had not articulated a sufficient basis for any such decision."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2456.222,2466.541,"That may be Your Honor, but the order of the courts says, remand for application of the principles of Atlantic."
1968.24,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.544,2497.666,You can take it very well then.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2497.666,2500.162,"I think it took extremely well, Your Honor."
1968.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2647.433,2651.58,I don't know this -- what this argument approves or disapproves --
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2651.58,2651.993,What's that --
1968.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2651.993,2663.994,"It doesn't help the Court as I understand it to decide the merits of this case, what are the merits of this case?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2663.994,2665.32,I'm going to go into that Your Honor.
1968.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2685.034,2694.364,"Well, maybe they weren't the applicant of some other rule, we're not captives of Atlantic, we didn't decide everything in Atlantic."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2694.364,2695.78,"Well, Your Honors say -- the --"
1968.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2695.78,2699.081,We're not a first year class in law school.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2699.081,2704.058,What was that?
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2857.019,2873.229,"Professor Handler, I asked Mr. Friedman some questions about the record with respect to evidence as to handling by the service stations of the products of others."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,2873.229,2878.751,I'm delighted to answer that Your Honor.
1968.24,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3031.858,3033.982,"Professor Handler, I thought what Mr. Friedman."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3033.982,3035.429,I'm sorry I don't hear you Mr. Justice.
1968.24,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3035.429,3048.167,"I thought what Mr. Friedman said was we are not involved here with a case of overt coercion not that we are not involved with the case of coercion, am I wrong?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3048.167,3053.067,"Well, I'll accept that Your Honor for purposes of the argument."
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.347,3088.474,In the sense that -- I suppose you say then that Texaco didn't have any kind of dominant power of any kind.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3088.474,3095.466,"No, the Court of Appeals held that Texaco had dominant power."
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.246,3100.727,"Alright, let's assume that they have dominant power and now what is that mean?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3100.727,3101.265,What was that?
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.265,3103.498,What is that mean to have dominant power?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3103.498,3109.225,We think that dominant power means the power to force people to do something against their will.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3109.225,3116.954,And did the -- but the Court of Appeals said that Texaco had not attempted to exercise that power?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3116.954,3121.978,That is correct and this record establishes the correctness of that conclusion.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3121.978,3127.023,"Now, apparently though there were some promotion by Texaco?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3127.023,3127.994,That is correct.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3127.994,3135.385,And that in your book and apparently in the Court of Appeals' book is not exercise of dominant power?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3135.385,3137.052,That is correct.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.511,3147.78,And a man with dominant power can recommend TBA without exercising its dominant power?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3147.78,3149.144,That is correct.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.272,3152.144,And otherwise you lose a case?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3152.144,3158.421,That's our submission Your Honor that power plus salesmanship does not add up to illegality.
1968.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.421,3170.623,"Well, what should I've understood Mr. Friedman to say when he said, “Well, we may not have a club here but we have the gentler touch.”"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3170.623,3174.681,I would deny that we have any kind of a touch.
1968.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3240.384,3252.288,"Well, Mr. Handler, what about the one Mr. Friedman read to us where they went to the dealer and said -- dealer said, “I'd like to buy cheaper tire?”"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3266.982,3285.726,"Your Honor, I will answer that specific incident and then I'm going to review other incidents in this record which led the Court of Appeals to say that this finding of the Commission with respect to the supplier testimony was not supported by the retroact."
1968.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.059,3288.108,That you agree on --
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3288.108,3289.217,What's that?
1968.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.217,3291.514,That witness did testify to that?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3291.514,3292.867,"Yes, I'm going to answer that."
1968.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.867,3293.099,Oh!
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3294.55,3308.398,"Mr. Tidwell as my good friend points out had the conversation with the dealer, with the salesmen which he asked for the salesmen advice."
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3764.604,3785.062,"Professor Handler, would you tell us precisely what the contract between Texaco on the one hand and Goodyear and Firestone provides with respect to the promotional services to be performed by Texaco?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3785.062,3790.207,The contract is very brief.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3861.142,3864.742,"Well, let's retrace that a minute."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3879.941,3885.026,They engaged in salesmanship and promotion of these products.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3885.026,3885.33,Alright.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3911.375,3921.646,"There may be an ambiguity when Your Honors speaks of selling, they're not selling in a normal sense of taking the line and try to get the dealer."
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3938.389,3952.442,"And but with respect to take another subject with respect to the use of the Texaco credit card that is available even if it's not a Goodyear or Firestone product, isn't that?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3952.442,3957.514,It's available if any kind of TBA.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3957.514,3968.284,But and the -- how about the distribution of promotional materials such as signs to be erected in the service station?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3968.284,3975.995,The dealers have signs of all kinds and they have signs of TBA -- they have the signs of Firestone and Goodrich.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3975.995,3989.797,Does the Texaco representative distribute to the service stations promotional materials such as signs of the -- of Goodyear and Firestone?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,3989.797,3994.554,"No, that's done by Goodrich or Firestone itself."
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3994.554,4010.228,"So that what this comes down to briefly and roughly is that Texaco you said, does these Texaco representatives do not actually sell in the sense of taking orders, is that right?"
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4010.228,4011.393,That's correct.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4011.393,4046.101,"Well, what you're telling us is that the Texaco representatives do in fact promote the sale in the sense of suggesting that the dealer buy products of these two companies as he -- that the Texaco representative instructs the service station operator in the problems attendant upon the use, the inventory etcetera and sale techniques of TBA."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4046.101,4047.389,That's correct.
1968.24,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4047.389,4070.13,"And I suppose to put this in the narrowest possible focus as your presenting in the case to us, the question is whether those activities which you say cost Texaco 70% of its total commissions that it receives."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4095.802,4100.843,"With one amendment, you first stated the jugular issue Your Honor."
1968.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4248.625,4260.565,May I ask you what is the principal service that Texaco renders for this Commission?
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4260.565,4264.003,I believe it's what I've told Justice Fortas it's a --
1968.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4264.003,4266.531,"Well, I know but you told him a lot of things."
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4267.295,4268.409,Principal?
1968.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4268.409,4269.847,Yes.
1968.24,1,36015,milton_handler,,4269.847,4272.478,I don't know what would be the principal item.
1968.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4273.489,4274.554,"Well, what is the dominant?"
1968.24,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,4278.391,4280.103,I don't think so.
1968.24,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4296.601,4301.61,You mean that they rendered the same service or nothing.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4301.61,4302.089,To the non --
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4302.089,4303.119,To the nonsponsored people --
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4303.119,4305.28,"To that by this, that is correct."
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4310.568,4315.258,"Well, why did they pay you an enormous commission on this kind then?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4315.258,4323.273,"Well, because we are training the dealer to handle TBA and they're paying us for the recommendation."
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4323.273,4324.019,"Well, if they can get it for gather nothing --"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4324.019,4325.795,And the services that we're rendering.
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4325.795,4328.75,If they can get it for nothing why did they pay you?
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4328.75,4329.938,"Well, --"
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4329.938,4331.347,They don't get the recommendation.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4331.347,4333.17,What's that?
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4333.17,4334.913,They don't get the recommendation.
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4334.913,4336.524,That's the key word.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4336.524,4341.537,They don't get -- they don't get the recommendation for nothing.
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4341.537,4343.733,Yes.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4343.733,4358.191,But the salesman is neutral and he helps the dealer in the purchase of any kind of TBA that he may desire and this record establishes the total freedom of choice of the dealer.
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4554.88,4564.056,"Mr. Handler, is it admitted that Texaco “urged” its dealers to handle these projects?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4564.056,4566.717,I missed one word Your Honor.
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4566.717,4570.404,“Urged”
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4570.404,4578.434,"I don't know what “urged” means, it recommended and I might say that --"
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4578.434,4597.898,"Well, when you have a one-year contract subject to cancellation on 10 days notice and a company the size of Texaco wouldn't its recommendation be a little more than just a recommendation?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4597.898,4599.807,I don't think so Your Honor.
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4608.104,4612.242,And that they cut -- that they cut two ways.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4612.242,4613.111,Why?
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4613.111,4616.36,Maybe nobody disobeyed.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4616.36,4624.554,"Well, we know Your Honor it can't cut two ways because we know that the preponderance of the TBA handled was nonsponsored."
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4627.221,4636.386,It cannot be denied but it's also the point that when the dominant economic factor is present.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4647.071,4649.063,I don't think so.
1968.24,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4676.48,4679.6,I would prefer stay with antitrust.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4694.532,4722.854,He had the fact that dealers who are in very short supply that there's vague competition for good dealers and that there's great economic lost if they stationed as closed down because you can't get a dealer and this is perennial situation in this industry and the economic lost by having a station closed is much greater than any gain that you can get out of these commissions.
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4778.338,4791.391,"Apparently then do you think that the Commission finding -- Commission's finding that just to the contrary, just as unsupportable and there has to be set aside?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4791.391,4799.444,Under Universal Camera it was set aside by the Court of Appeals and imposing the grant of certiorari.
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4848.882,4850.494,What are you searching for here?
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4857.282,4867.086,The Commission said that sales-commission with dominant power plus recommendation is an unfair method of competition and we say that --
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4867.086,4870.737,Now that's all -- is that all they held?
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4873.63,4874.594,That is correct.
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4874.594,4875.897,Just a recommendation and --
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4875.897,4879.563,We construe that as being a per se rule.
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4879.563,4893.444,"Well, now, what are the standards for a none -- for the Federal Trade Commission has to follow in determining what's an unfair method of competition or unfair practice that --"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4893.444,4897.041,I'm delighted Your Honors asked that question.
1968.24,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4933.68,4940.889,"But where did -- where -- what's the source of your requirement, there must be some restrictive effect on competition?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4940.889,4948.027,I think the legislative history of the statute and the course of judicial construction.
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4948.027,4949.972,What's the closest case in this Court setting some --
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4949.972,4950.69,What's that?
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4950.69,4962.791,"What's the closest case in this Court setting, describing the standards of the Federal Trade Commission has to follow in finding an unfair practice?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4962.791,4968.44,"I don't believe from them where I could, I can pinpoint the exact case but I am familiar with the line of cases."
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4974.655,4988.288,"Well, that must be part of our problem in this case then, is made the Commission within the framework of this Act to find record power plus recommendation to be an unfair (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,4988.288,4990.858,They may do if what Your Honor so hold.
1968.24,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4999.242,5007.938,Well is that in or is it whether we can hold that the Federal Trade Commission should determine what is an unfair method competition?
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5007.938,5008.956,"Well, I think --"
1968.24,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5008.956,5016.605,And that our review of that determination of what is an unfair method of competition is a very limited.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5016.605,5032.676,Your Honors have held many times that whatever the Commission holds to be unlawful is in tackle to great weight but that in the final analysis what is unfair competition is a matter of law and Your Honors have the final word.
1968.24,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5041.578,5044.781,"Well, then it's not exactly a factual question, is it?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5044.781,5045.298,I'm sorry.
1968.24,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5045.298,5047.724,"It's not a factual question then, is it?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5047.724,5069.085,"No, no, it's a question of law as to what is an unfair method of competition and I think that as Justice Cardozo pointed out and already a case that if you simply gave a blank check is to what maybe held to be unfair without any standards that this would be --"
1968.24,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5069.085,5075.027,"Well, what -- if it's not a factual question and what's Universal Camera got to do with this?"
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5075.027,5075.201,Oh!
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5089.417,5099.48,Yes but if it was a matter of law that foreclosure isn't essential in the -- to the unfair method of competition.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5099.48,5117.839,"If the foreclosure is not necessary, then you have a question of law and that was why I amended Justice Fortas' statement whether power plus recommendation is violative of the Federal Trade Commission Act absent anticompetitive effect and absent foreclosure."
1968.24,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5117.839,5118.997,Alright.
1968.24,3,36015,milton_handler,,5118.997,5138.015,"Now, if I may conclude our proposition with respect to one of the points that was made by my good friend and also made by the Commission that having one company free of restraint and having two other companies under the order of the Commission is discriminatory."
1968.24,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5226.812,5227.919,Mr. Barton.
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5227.919,5231.505,Mr. Chief Justice and if Your Honors please.
1968.24,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5326.299,5326.85,"Excuse me, Mr. Barton."
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5326.85,5328.484,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.24,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5328.484,5333.117,Is Goodrich involved and either Shell or Atlantic?
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5333.117,5333.763,"No, Your Honor."
1968.24,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5333.763,5334.356,What was that?
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5334.356,5335.949,No Your Honor they're not.
1968.24,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5336.07,5342.288,Are these arrangements exclusive that is to say they're not exclusive.
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5342.288,5355.811,They're not exclusive Your Honor as a matter of fact Texaco has similar arrangements at the time this case was tried 12 years ago although with the contrary and I think I'm the only one here within the case and this tried.
1968.24,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5369.337,5373.041,Is that broken up on regional basis?
1968.24,4,21929,edgar_e_barton,,5373.041,5375.549,"No, Your Honor it's not a broken up on any regional basis."
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5811.714,5815.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5944.177,5970.26,"Well, Mr. Friedman, I gather then that you feel that although the question maybe that the -- whether the Commission could say power plus promotion is nevertheless there's a really the question is whether the Commission could rationally decide that promotion by one with power really may have some substantial consequences?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5970.26,5971.554,Yes and then we --
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5971.554,5977.327,And if that were wholly irrational why I -- is that what this case is about?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5977.327,5988.609,I --We think so Mr. Justice consistent with the long line of cases in this Court which have reviewed Commission decisions under Section 5 is to what the Commission' authority.
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5988.609,6011.298,"Well, what if there were no evidence whatsoever in the record that as to what consequence promotion by Texaco had, could the Commission just rear back and say, well, look that on our own expertise, we know that when somebody with Texaco's power says, this, it's going to have this kind of consequence."
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6011.298,6014.777,I think they have to have some basis for their expertise --
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6014.777,6016.142,In the record?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6016.142,6018.229,I don't know Mr. Justice because they have --
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6018.229,6024.796,In the record if they have to have something there then I suppose we have to look at the evidence on the other side then.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6024.796,6025.523,"Well, but I think --"
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6025.523,6027.885,"And then it does become a factual matter, doesn't it?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6027.885,6044.742,"Well, it's a factual matter only in the sense that you've got to see what the Commission had but it seems to me the answer we think is that in this kind -- this is the area where the Commission has very great discretion as to evaluating the impact of this practice."
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6044.742,6049.726,"Well, you think they could be -- they could just stand and said, we don't need any evidence?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6049.726,6050.85,"No, I don't think they could say --"
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6050.85,6059.205,"We don't need any evidence at all, we just know that when Texaco says something like they've been saying, please buy this that it's going to have this kind of a consequence."
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6059.205,6061.641,"No, I think there has to be some of it."
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6061.641,6063.225,"So, there has to be some proof?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6063.225,6065.664,There have to be some proof as to what the impact upon --
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6065.664,6070.45,"Well, what if it's in challenged by the other side which it has been?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6070.45,6072.014,"Well, if it challenge that --"
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6072.014,6074.848,"The other side says, there is no factual basis for that"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6074.848,6078.466,But the Court of Appeals did not say there's no factual basis for this.
1968.24,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6082.342,6088.618,"Well, they at least said it -- it wasn't enough evidence having even to make the rational choice, is it?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6088.618,6091.075,"No, they -- no, Mr. Justice. We don't think they said."
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6138.499,6146.635,The Commission explained -- how does the Commission explained that only 30% -- was it 30% of the dealers or was it just 30% of the total volume that was sponsored?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6146.635,6149.732,"No, it was 30% -- let me explain it."
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6172.072,6185.923,"Well, yes but does that make a big -- how do they explain now that apparently in all of lot of dealers who were promoted by Texaco exercise their choice to buy from someone else?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6185.923,6188.368,I think the type of plan --
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6188.368,6191.051,So every dealer understood he had a free choice?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6191.051,6197.488,I don't -- I think the difference maybe Mr. Justice these plans are not always completely effective.
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6200.825,6209.286,"Yes, but why wouldn't that be effective if there was dominant power and exercise of the -- why wouldn't it be effective?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6209.286,6212.218,"Well, I suppose to some extent it may depend on the --"
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6212.218,6217.431,Do you -- I suppose you have to say that either wasn't dominant or wasn't exercise one or the other?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6217.431,6223.664,"Well, I take it again it may depend on what the reaction of the individual dealer is to the situation."
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6223.664,6235.2,May it not also depend on the reaction of the customer who comes in and didn't like their kind of tires and he asked him to get him some somewhere else.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6236.524,6240.613,That would -- I have to say Mr. Justice in all candid that --
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6240.613,6242.098,Maybe your record doesn't show it?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6242.098,6259.991,"No, I'd say in all candid Mr. Justice that the record does indicate that where a particular customer wanted a particular single tire, one customer generally speaking most of the dealers would go out and stock and buy this particular type of tire even though they didn't stock them."
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6259.991,6260.743,That's what I meant.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6274.157,6280.776,Then maybe if the other thing I suppose Mr. Justice is of course Goodrich and Firestone are popular products.
1968.24,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6284.537,6305.535,"Well, you don't think it would have made any difference in this case if that Firestone or Texaco were given good set of Miranda warnings to everybody that you really don't -- we really -- you got a free choice and you're not bound to do anything, we're not forcing you."
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6321.432,6342.608,"Well, no I don't Mr. Justice because it seems to us what we have here is one, the relationship and we can see they did tell many dealers that they were free to buy what they wanted but apparently the record strongly indicates that despite the statement many of the dealers did not feel they had a complete freedom."
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6357.37,6369.333,Does the record show whether the Texaco dealers knew the amount of profit that will go to the company if they sold a particular brand that they wanted to?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6369.333,6372.838,"No, the record does not show whether they had any knowledge of that."
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6372.838,6376.266,Doesn't show that whether they had any knowledge that they did get anything?
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6376.266,6378.317,"No, the record does not show that."
1968.24,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6382.864,6386.011,"Well, wouldn't that be irrelevant piece of evidence?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6386.011,6397.728,"Well, that would make our case even stronger I think if in fact the dealers knew that Texaco was in fact getting a substantial amount on the sales."
1968.24,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6517.783,6547.534,"Suppose Texaco had it some own line of tires, in your judgment could the Commission find that it was an unfair method of competition or for Texaco to make recommendations to its service stations that they buy the Texaco tire?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6547.534,6550.691,I would think Mr. Justice the Commission could sell conclude.
1968.24,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6555.906,6574.348,"Well, I know that but do you think that Texaco therefore could not even if you don't have a tie-in sale, in fact just as they are now except that it's Texaco product, do you think that would still an unfair method of competition?"
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6574.348,6577.435,"I would think the Commission could so conclude, yes."
1968.24,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6577.435,6582.901,Why can't it so conclude with respect to motor oil.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6587.42,6588.323,It does.
1968.24,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6588.323,6595.786,And I suppose that its dealers are at least encouraged to buy and stock Texaco motor oil.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6621.655,6623.6,"Well, I don't know Mr. Justice."
1968.24,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6628.86,6633.287,You sure get into a problem alright but I think the answer is kind of difficult.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6633.287,6638.953,"Fortunately, the Commission has not yet had to face up to this problem."
1968.24,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6638.953,6639.245,Very well.
1968.24,5,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6639.245,6640.461,Thank you.
