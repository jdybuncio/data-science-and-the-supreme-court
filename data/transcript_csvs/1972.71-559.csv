1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.363,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-559, United States against Fuller."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,35.74,38.413,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-559,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,152.901,159.364,"Mr. Sachse, does it have a term stated however even though it is revocable?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,159.364,169.507,The term is not stated in the statue except that it cannot exceed 10 years as an administrative regulation and practice.
1972.71-559,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,182.073,189.944,"There isn't any formal procedure for termination, isn’t it or is there?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,189.944,220.666,"If -- I think there is a formal procedure for termination and to this extent that if a man applies for the permit for a second year and the Government determines not to grant the permit the second year, the Government will allow him to -- it will state its reasons why the permits not being granted and will allow him to state his reasons why he thinks the permit should be granted."
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.9,287.134,"And it’s your contention, I take it that the department -- was it, agriculture or interior?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,287.134,288.25,It’s interior.
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.25,297.781,The Department of the Interior will not take a jaundiced view of the renewal of his permit because he has less fee land now than he did before?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,297.781,298.338,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.056,510.558,"Where is the -- the land has been overruled by the Congress or at least in the narrow facts of Rands, it has been pretty well run over I think."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,510.558,519.184,I don’t think so at all Your Honor and Mr. Burch argues that but I think it points out a very essential distinction.
1972.71-559,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.897,634.946,And it’s just a statutory decision would have capability of overruling the constitutional conspiracy?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,634.946,641.864,It's a Statutory Act without capability of overruling a constitutional decision.
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.864,649.418,"Well nonetheless, Congress gets its way in this case because as you say Congress can grant more than the Fifth Amendment requires it to give?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,649.418,666.579,"And Congress could get its way in this case if Congress did something that it has not done, and that is to declare that a Taylor Grazing Act permit, on Section 3 of Taylor Grazing Act creates a vested right of property interest in land."
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,804.378,805.173,I remember --
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,805.173,806.463,Sir?
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,806.463,824.545,"-- in the Western part of the country, there at some places, some land that borders a wilderness area and the wilderness area is one under the act that cannot be developed or you owned that the Federal Government for recreation purposes."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,824.545,825.525,Correct.
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,825.525,832.947,"Now, the location of that land in looking out over a wilderness, gives it a very enhanced market value."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,837.412,845.963,"No, I think that should be taken into consideration and any general environmental value ought to be taken into considerations, but what shouldn’t be taken into --"
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,845.963,855.109,So that would taken into consideration then the value of what the Government is providing in the wilderness area?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,855.109,867.852,That's right and I don’t want to argue and I don’t think it would be right to establish a broad principle that says that any conceivable value that the Government is added to property is not a subject to compensation.
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,903.133,913.082,But we do know that the Taylor Grazing Rights are usually available only to contiguous owners?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,913.082,913.626,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,949.468,951.373,Does he pay anything for the permit?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,951.373,951.696,Yes sir.
1972.71-559,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.553,962.469,Is it just some nominal sum or --
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,962.469,965.899,"I -- well, I wouldn't want to mislead the Court."
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.547,995.835,"Going back to this other situation, I suppose if a man has a home overlooking Rock Creek Park either in Washington or up the platonic on the palace aids area, the view that he has contributes to the -- enhances the value of the real estate?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,995.835,996.658,Correct.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,996.658,1000.059,But that doesn’t give him any absolute right to the view or does it?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1000.059,1000.96,"No, it doesn’t."
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.96,1011.075,"Government might come along and put a dam right there and spoil his view without giving him any right, I assume to recover for spoiling his view?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1011.075,1012.674,That is correct.
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.095,1016.495,"Mr. Sachse, (Inaudible) to start with this question."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1046.589,1061.432,"Well, I would like to start by saying that the right that this individual has to use the public land is by Congressional enactment less than a property right, is a permit to use the federal land."
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.432,1062.742,What do you mean when you say less than a property right?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1062.742,1064.35,Less than a property right?
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1110.44,1128.066,"Some of our big ranches -- the big ranches on the west have a little nucleus 200 acres owned and fee by the owner and 50,000 and more acres have particular grazing land around it that may sell it to the millions of dollars on the market price."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1128.066,1133.641,That is correct.
1972.71-559,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1166.485,1169.182,"Well, if you said you are long enough, you can always find something in Court against you.[Laughter]"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1169.182,1171.516,That's right.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.816,1215.99,We’ll pick up after lunch at that point.
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1222.333,1230.171,I just want to make one or two points then to reserve the rest of the time for a rebuttal if I can.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.175,1282.315,"Well, when you say, if the grazing land is taken first, you're not using that phrase as a word of art to constitutional taking, are you?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1288.006,1288.225,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.225,1293.085,And then we would take the fee under the conventional taking process.
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1293.085,1294.546,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.62,1305.848,"I say there is nothing to take, that’s your argument?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1305.848,1306.891,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.321,1329.921,"You say that at least the holding in Jaramillo is dead duck, isn’t it?"
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1329.921,1333.44,"Well, Cox versus United States is a case that I am talking."
1972.71-559,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1369.828,1370.747,Mr. Sachse.
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1370.747,1371.328,Sir.
1972.71-559,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1371.328,1391.273,"Suppose the Government, the Federal Government had improved the land now being taken say with an expense of irrigation system or something like that, and now the United States wants to take the land."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1396.08,1397.23,I don’t know whether I would.
1972.71-559,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1424.785,1427.454,How would you distinguish that in your situation?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1427.454,1434.842,I’d distinguish it in one; the value added is by a use of public land that's still in the public domain.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.477,1470.11,"But most often -- most often such an improvement if you would call it that is one of which is shared in common by great many people, perhaps people of different places, but if a new lake is created for example by backing up water with the dam, enhances the value of lake shore, creates lake shore a property out of which once was a pasture."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1473.514,1474.84,That would be so.
1972.71-559,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1474.84,1479.546,"But what I was thinking of it Mr. Sachse used to be two, I don’t know that still is."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1504.46,1512.964,"I would say this, Your Honor, with the right for the Solicitor General to change his mind if that case came up."
1972.71-559,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1549.192,1567.728,"The mere fact that you had a pasture, in other words acquired property or part of the property by gift from the Government, would not be relevant when at some later time, the Government tried to condemn the properties that is now your property as the pond gets there."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1567.728,1570.351,That's correct.
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.351,1573.326,The only point is a gift point?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1573.326,1576.285,We're not seeking a broad ruling in this case.
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1583.799,1585.126,What kind of interest?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1596.369,1612.48,"If the state owned the land, we would argue that Mr. Fuller has less than a compensable interest in the state land which he held under tenure that was less than a lease, and then we would not have to pay for it."
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.143,1614.751,Why not?
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1614.751,1633.044,"Because under what I hope are established principles of just compensation, the Government only pays for established property rights that a person holds, not for rights that are less than a type."
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1633.044,1640.17,"So your point isn’t the fact that the Federal Government gave him this gift, is if anybody gave it to them."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1641.102,1641.366,"No, no."
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1641.632,1643.159,You don’t have to go that far.
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1643.159,1648.571,"No, what I am saying is -- I wasn’t thinking of the gift case, the gift case."
1972.71-559,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.098,1654.562,"Well, that's in real time."
1972.71-559,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1654.562,1655.244,But I agree with you.
1972.71-559,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.274,1699.41,Tank you Mr. Sachse.
1972.71-559,1,23606,frank_haze_burch,,1706.651,1712.051,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-559,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.925,1747.829,"Well, does it really make any difference one way or the other, whether he is still there or whether he is gone?"
1972.71-559,1,23606,frank_haze_burch,,1747.829,1763.046,Only that I think that the possibilities of less than adequate compensation are present and the indication would be with counsel saying do that the Rands is still in existence and operating is not effect.
1972.71-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.648,1878.85,"Mr. Burch, how is the state land treated in the judge's charge of the jury, if it was treated at all?"
1972.71-559,1,23606,frank_haze_burch,,1878.85,1885.751,"The judge specifically told them that they couldn't consider the value of those permits either, although there were ten-year leases as I recall."
1972.71-559,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.852,1911.534,Are where those ten-year leases terminable by the state?
1972.71-559,1,23606,frank_haze_burch,,1911.534,1912.425,Yes sir.
1972.71-559,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1912.425,1919.342,"So, that puts them in the same posture as (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-559,1,23606,frank_haze_burch,,1919.342,1935.41,"Somewhat different, Mr. Chief Justice, somewhat different simply because there is a preference in Arizona that I am unaware of whether not it holds over in Taylor, but Arizona, if the state needed that land for any purpose for a length of time and then put it back on the market, the preference would go to that (Inaudible) who had been the prior lessee or permittee."
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3270.211,3273.061,I just have few things I want to straighten up.
1972.71-559,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3291.916,3298.114,"But there would be error only if some appraiser had in effect, indicated he had done so or as counsel argued (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3298.114,3300.501,I am about to get to that.
1972.71-559,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.225,3382.475,"If an appraiser got on the stand and told you and testify that about the value of this fee land and it sounded rather large, I would expect that you on cross examination would have asked if he took into account the enhancement from permit land, wouldn't you?"
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3382.475,3382.755,I don't know.
1972.71-559,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.398,3393.667,"Well, what if you -- what I would think you would have it -- if that appraiser testified to a value far in excess of what the Government testimony?"
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3393.667,3410.501,"I think there is such testimony in the record of this case where the lands were treated together and the Government on cross examination tried to point out well, you are figuring the two and together and Mr. Fuller's appraisers will say, well, it's one unitary operation, you can't value one without the other."
1972.71-559,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.501,3423.398,"Do you have in mind what Mr. Fuller's experts value on the fee land alone amounted to, something over million dollars?"
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3428.116,3443.127,"I believe they came out in the area of $800,000.00 for an award on what they called the value of the fee land, but in figuring the value of the fee land, they figured how many cows could be raised on the fee land together with the --"
1972.71-559,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3443.127,3445.547,How many acres of fee was there?
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3445.547,3445.887,920.
1972.71-559,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3445.887,3448.419,"920, wasn't it?"
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3453.635,3462.488,They got a good deal less than they might have gotten and a good deal more than the Government thought they should have had on the basis of the fee land itself.
1972.71-559,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3462.488,3465.544,Isn't true in most condemnation cases?
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3465.544,3469.022,I think that's often so.
1972.71-559,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.022,3469.7,Oh really?
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3474.661,3475.992,I think that is correct.
1972.71-559,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.442,3485.431,That's right -- a lot more money with even if you are in the case.
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3485.431,3487.872,I think that's --
1972.71-559,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3487.872,3498.801,"Well, suppose during the case, the US Attorney had said that we have revoked to permit."
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3498.801,3499.8,If during the case?
1972.71-559,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3499.8,3502.968,Put on testimony and said it's now revoked?
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3502.968,3504.339,Right in the middle of the trial?
1972.71-559,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3504.339,3505.963,Yes.
1972.71-559,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3505.963,3512.272,"I guess [Attempt to Laughter] depending on what the prior testimony had been, you might have a mistrial."
1972.71-559,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3526.874,3527.914,Thank you Mr. Sachse.
