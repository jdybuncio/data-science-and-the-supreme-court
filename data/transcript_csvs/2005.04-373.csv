2005.04-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.263,We'll hear argument first today in Maryland versus Blake.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,5.577,8.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.285,68.134,"Now, what has to be considered, by way of evidence, in evaluating whether the suspect has initiated the additional conversation?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,72.827,74.772,Yes.
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.569,76.739,And--
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,76.739,77.4,--the suspect's--
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,77.4,85.131,"--and the fact that, on the charges which he saw, it said he was subject to the death penalty, but that was not correct?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,85.131,90.036,"--That would go to whether the statement was voluntary, it would not go to--"
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.036,90.517,It would not--
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,90.517,91.07,--the degree--
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.07,94.439,--you would not consider it in connection with the initiation--
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,94.439,95.474,"--No, the--"
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.474,95.905,--question?
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,95.905,98.783,"--No, the purpose of Edwards was to prevent police badgering."
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.037,110.288,"Well, I--"
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.288,110.748,Counsel--
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.748,120.579,"--I suppose that if they knowingly put death on in order to get him off his balance, that would be badgering, wouldn't it?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,120.579,124.469,The... the purpose of Edwards was to prevent police questioning.
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.485,130.649,"Well, but--"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,130.649,131.129,The--
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.129,134.912,"--the initial question Justice O'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,138.944,142.615,"--And my answer is no, that we do not consider what... the death sentence."
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,143.999,145.103,Then why consider age?
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,174.321,180.738,--Because the critical inquiry is whether the suspect understood that it was his choice and that the police would stop questioning.
2005.04-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,180.738,181.663,But the--
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,181.663,181.963,"So, the--"
2005.04-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,181.963,186.457,--but the trial judge made certain findings.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,250.962,259.036,I think what... you look at... the relevant factors are the factors that go to whether a reasonable person would understand that questioning was going to stop.
2005.04-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.101,262.946,What about the factors that I mentioned?
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,295.133,299.155,"--No, because I think what you're looking at is not voluntariness."
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.281,304.381,"Well, but it--"
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,304.381,304.691,"--Yes, but you're--"
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.691,305.052,--it has to be--
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.052,305.915,--you're making--
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,305.915,313.536,"--voluntary at some... if you held the man's hand to a burning iron, we would... we'd say that's not voluntary."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,313.536,314.531,It's involuntary.
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.531,317.921,"So, it has to be voluntary, certainly, in the lay sense of the term."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,337.579,339.366,"Well, I think that's the second step of the analysis."
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.183,350.609,"Well, but I... you can't initiate something involuntarily and have that count, can you?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,351.32,351.492,--Our--
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.492,358.193,"--let's say involuntarily, in the lay sense of the word, in the common sense of the word, where it was actually physically coerced."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,358.354,361.082,--It would be an involuntary statement under the second--
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.082,361.252,All right.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,361.252,361.743,--step of the analysis.
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.743,362.003,"--No, but what about--"
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.003,362.976,"No, no, it's the--"
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.976,363.757,--the first step?
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,363.757,364.068,--first part of the analysis.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,364.068,365.141,In the first part of the--

2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.955,368.593,--The first part of the analysis is whether or not he initiates.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,368.593,368.884,--Yes.
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.884,372.084,And you're trying to tell us that the initiation can be involuntarily?
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,374.239,379.102,"Well, what we're trying to say is that the purpose of Edwards was to prevent badgering, where the police convey--"
2005.04-373,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.102,379.786,--All right.
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.384,391.349,"I mean, you have to concede--"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,391.349,394.088,"--Well, if they're twisting their back, you're not thinking they're going to stop questioning."

2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,396.275,407.598,"--Aren't you... aren't you confusing Miranda, which is a question of comprehension followed by voluntary waiver, with the question of initiation?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,450.707,465.563,"--Well, Maryland's position is that if you look at the analysis in Elstad and Seibert, where what this Court said is, you don't look at whether something caused something else, you look at whether there was a cure in the sense that the suspect understood his rights--"
2005.04-373,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.563,490.525,"Ms. Graeff, is there any case which says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,499.364,500.787,--Not that I'm aware of.

2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,501.648,506.775,"--the position that initiation is a purely formal inquiry, a matter of magic words?"

2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,515.118,515.368,--given a genuine choice?
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.368,516.129,--answer my question.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,517.124,522.78,"You look at whether he understood that the questioning was going to cease, and it was up to him--"

2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,524.044,524.905,--whether to speak.
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.905,525.776,--you're avoiding my question.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,525.776,526.45,I'm sorry.
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.45,544.172,"My question is, Is the act of initiation a purely formal act on your view, so that so long as the suspect says the magic words, it doesn't matter what is in his mind or what he understands?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,545.526,545.867,No.
2005.04-373,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.867,547.321,It's not formal.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,547.321,556.799,"What you need to look at is whether an objective person in the suspect's position would understand that questioning was going to cease, and there was... would be no more questioning."

2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,558.704,559.477,--I think that's a given.

2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,570.761,571.564,That's--
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,571.564,572.225,--begin talking.
2005.04-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.225,573.299,"--the issue, it seems to me."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,573.299,576.387,And there's no question here that he wanted to begin talking.

2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.678,733.339,--subjectively true.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,752.306,755.778,--We have that Detective Johns then pushed him out of the cell--
2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.778,756.479,Yes.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,756.479,757.622,--and they left.
2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.31,760.53,Yes.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,760.53,763.871,"--then when Detective Johns came back, 28 minutes, he didn't say anything."
2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.871,764.051,Yes.
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,764.051,765.135,He didn't ask any questions.
2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.391,770.662,All right.
2005.04-373,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.032,771.172,--May I ask--
2005.04-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.172,771.323,--we have a passage--
2005.04-373,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.323,773.588,--May I ask you two rather elementary questions?
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,773.588,774.251,Yes.
2005.04-373,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.251,779.116,"One of the issues is whether... when he spoke and said, ""Can I talk now""?"
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,785.384,787.661,The state has the burden to show that he initiated.
2005.04-373,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.661,789.327,"And so, the State did have the burden."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,799.084,803.387,"We think none, because the trial court did not focus on the proper analysis."
2005.04-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.968,807.369,May I--
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,807.369,808.11,--rejected in Seibert--
2005.04-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.11,820.47,"--May I... before we get to that, I read the trial court's opinion, and it didn't seem to me that it was playing, as Justice Breyer said, this game of legal words and labels."
2005.04-373,0,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,894.321,896.999,"--If the inquiry is a... clearly erroneous, yes."
2005.04-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.786,916.718,"--Thank you, Ms. Graeff."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,922.254,925.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-373,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.786,937.188,"Well, tell us--"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,937.188,937.809,--without counsel.
2005.04-373,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,937.809,939.917,"--what factors, in your view, can be considered."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,940.588,941.231,I think--
2005.04-373,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,941.231,942.563,--The defendant's age?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,947.098,954.119,"--I think all of those things can be present in any Miranda case, and are taken care of in a normal Miranda analysis as to whether it was voluntary or not."
2005.04-373,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,955.953,964.45,"Well, but what we're trying to determine is, What do you consider in determining whether he has... a reasonable person initiating--"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,964.45,964.841,"--Right, and I--"
2005.04-373,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.841,965.414,--further discussion?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,965.414,979.415,"--I think you could say that all of those voluntariness factors should be looked at, in terms of initiation, although I just think the analysis would be exactly the same as if you were asking whether he made a voluntary waiver, that it's the same voluntary... voluntariness analysis."
2005.04-373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.825,985.714,"Well, I'm not so sure, because a voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1005.483,1011.542,"--But you never... there's never... first of all, he had gotten a Miranda warning, initially; and that was when he said he wanted to see a lawyer."
2005.04-373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1018.842,1019.245,I agree with that.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1034.31,1034.82,--But--
2005.04-373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.82,1036.263,Any new Miranda warning.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1036.263,1040.156,"--Right, but I... still, the... there has been, already, an... a Miranda warning."
2005.04-373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.156,1040.678,Yes.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1040.678,1044.067,"But, still, the question should be broken down into two parts."
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.829,1055.32,"But, Mr.--"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1055.32,1055.5,--or voluntariness.
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.5,1060.203,"--Feldman, do you agree that the State had the burden of proving voluntariness at the second stage?"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1060.203,1061.571,Yes.
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.571,1067.566,And why... and why should we not credit the finding of fact by the... by the trial judge--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1067.566,1068.96,"Well, if the--"
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.96,1070.865,--who found it was not voluntary?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1070.865,1073.863,--the middle level... what... Maryland has--
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.863,1074.617,The middle level--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1074.617,1075.188,--at the middle level--
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.188,1076.501,--said there was no Edwards violation.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1076.501,1076.722,--Right.
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.722,1078.659,"So, that doesn't contribute anything to the dialogue."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1078.659,1084.125,"But the State has argued that actually, given the procedures in this case, the defendant waived his voluntariness claim."
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.401,1088.398,"Well, you just told me you agree that the burden was on the--"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1088.398,1088.649,--Right.
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.221,1090.382,--State to prove voluntariness.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1095.509,1096.803,"--Well, I'd say... well, two things."
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.143,1100.474,I don't care--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1100.474,1101.005,--voluntariness.
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.005,1102.188,--what the Maryland Court of--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1102.188,1102.389,Not the midlevel--
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.389,1102.901,--Appeals said.

2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.672,1106.5,The highest court in Maryland also credited the finding.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1106.5,1107.444,"--No, the... I don't think so."
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.014,1114.747,"Well, in any event, we have a--"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1114.747,1114.927,And--
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.927,1119.0,"--a finding of fact by the trial court before us, and I don't... I still don't understand."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1121.165,1127.325,"--And I don't think... oh, because I don't... the... that court was relying on a... on the... on the... on the question of initiation."
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.818,1139.66,You disagree with the--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1139.66,1139.781,--means it's not--
2005.04-373,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.781,1143.914,--finding that... the... isn't it... aren't we entitled to give a... some presumption of validity?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1143.914,1153.943,"--Yes, but... well, I think that the trial... what the trial court... I think it... no, I don't think so, because I think the trial court was not operating under the correct standard of what it was supposed to... of what initiation consists of."
2005.04-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1153.943,1155.55,Because it's a mixed question of law and fact--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1155.55,1155.79,Right.
2005.04-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1155.79,1156.652,--and not a purely factual--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1156.652,1157.054,Right.
2005.04-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1157.054,1157.735,--determination.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1157.735,1158.015,That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.015,1180.612,"If you're going to the standard, which is, I think, the... actually, the difficult question here, what's wrong... should you say... what's wrong with saying... which is what I was pursuing... that, where there is a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police, the only real question is, Is a later initiation ""the fruit""?"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1180.612,1182.259,I--
2005.04-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.259,1184.504,And you say the State has to show it wasn't the fruit.

2005.04-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.641,1199.831,Why not?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1199.831,1200.592,--other cases.
2005.04-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1200.592,1201.425,Why... I understand that--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1201.425,1201.686,Because--
2005.04-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.686,1202.659,--there's a lot of language--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1202.659,1211.887,"--Because the... the point of the fruits analysis is... has to do with the deterrence function of the Fourth Amendment, which is nonexistent, or much, much reduced, in the Fifth Amendment context, and--"
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1211.887,1220.131,"No, but the standard fruit analysis is when you get something like a statement, and that statement then leads to further evidence."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1241.326,1244.845,"--And I think the Edwards rule is an important, but limited, rule."
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.947,1255.658,"No, I realize that."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1267.333,1268.076,--That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1268.076,1268.427,All right.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1276.292,1276.662,And--
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1276.662,1278.749,You say there was a legal error.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1280.724,1285.76,--The problem was that the trial court was not looking at all the factors that you would normally look at to decide voluntariness.
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1287.274,1287.434,What did it--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1287.434,1287.925,--initiation--
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1287.925,1288.377,--overlook?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1289.319,1292.72,"--It overlooked the fact that he had been given the Miranda warnings, that, as far as anybody--"
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.72,1295.488,That's always true in every Edwards case.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1295.488,1295.648,--Right.
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.778,1296.079,All right.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1296.319,1296.78,--so that's the case.
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.78,1297.373,--that's a wash.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1297.373,1297.703,It overlooked--
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1297.703,1298.084,What else did--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1298.084,1298.376,--the fact that--

2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1335.859,1336.329,--those are--
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1336.329,1336.67,--was it that she--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1336.67,1337.201,--extremely--
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1337.201,1337.263,--overlooked that?

2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1374.654,1375.418,Right.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.418,1376.491,Which is what Edwards is directing.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1376.491,1376.652,Right.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.086,1383.201,That no factfinder... and this is mixed fact and law... could reasonably come to that conclusion.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1383.201,1383.372,--That--
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.372,1387.023,"When it... when one of the... the last he had heard from the officers was,"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1392.91,1393.471,--Coupled--
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.471,1398.206,You're saying no reasonable judge could find that that defendant thought he would be hounded.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1398.206,1398.466,--Right.
2005.04-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.665,1408.418,But it doesn't count--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1408.418,1409.249,"--single comment, as can happen--"
2005.04-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.249,1441.336,"--Mr. Feldman, it doesn't count as badgering, or the equivalent, that the police... the... walk in, and they present not only the charges, but they present the application for the charges, which shows that the co perpetrator had talked to the police, talked his head off, and put all the blame, at every step on the way, on this defendant?"
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1444.115,1444.928,--But--
2005.04-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.928,1447.675,And is... was that improper to take into account?
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1458.037,1460.863,"--That... I mean, there's two points I'd like to make about that."
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.171,1499.55,It has nothing to do with whether the defendant thinks he is going to be hounded.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1499.55,1500.473,That's--
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.473,1500.654,It has--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1500.654,1500.914,--correct.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.914,1501.224,--to do with--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1501.224,1501.547,That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.547,1501.847,--with whether--
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1501.847,1502.028,That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.028,1506.15,--the defendant thinks he will be badgered and badgered until he finally talks.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1506.15,1506.41,That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.82,1508.114,Which is what Edwards is directed at.
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1508.114,1508.875,--That's correct.
2005.04-373,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.157,1514.312,"Well, Edwards is directed at avoiding badgering, but the issue before us is initiation."
2005.04-373,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1527.16,1535.004,"--I don't think they do, because, under the Court's decision in Bradshaw, there's initiation, and then there's always a separate voluntariness inquiry to take care of those problems."
2005.04-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.455,1536.278,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1540.61,1543.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.509,1564.713,What if it--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1564.713,1565.516,In fact--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.516,1575.255,"--What if, instead of the half hour or so, 24 hours had passed and they got a call from the defendant, said, ""I want to talk now""?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1578.927,1590.379,"--I think that if there had been 24 hours that had passed, then you would... it would be a factor that you would consider in deciding whether the defendant has initiated the conversation."
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.379,1591.054,Okay.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1591.234,1591.575,"Of course, that factor--"
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.575,1592.057,--if you can--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.057,1592.127,--can work the other way.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1606.889,1607.502,And--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1607.502,1611.815,"Of course, you know, we can play the game... 5 minutes, 20 minutes--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1611.815,1611.965,--Right.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1611.965,1612.348,--30 minutes.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1623.419,1633.329,"I certainly believe that the support is, in Edwards versus Arizona, that there should not be a cure unless the defendant himself initiates the contact."
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.329,1634.042,A cure--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1634.042,1634.232,"So, I think there is."
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.232,1634.733,--A cure of--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1634.733,1635.174,And if there is--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.174,1635.356,--I would have thought--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.356,1637.402,"--Sorry, go on."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1637.402,1637.582,--Sure.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.582,1641.253,"--I would have thought you would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1650.562,1665.877,"Yes, I think what I'm... with all due respect, I think what I'm telling the Court is that the practice should be, as it has been the last 25 years, that you do not allow cures of Edwards versus Arizona by the police intentionally violating one's rights and then attempting to cure it."
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.134,1675.186,A cure of what?
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1676.93,1677.874,Of a violation.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.874,1679.398,"--it seems to me, a lot of this discussion has come down to."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1706.287,1707.853,I disagree with Your Honor on... for two reasons.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.527,1762.86,Okay.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1762.86,1763.231,--that causes--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1763.231,1763.401,"Well, assuming--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1763.401,1763.742,--the person--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1763.742,1764.204,--there was--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1764.204,1764.685,--to give up his rights.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.685,1773.22,"--assuming there was overreaching on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1779.537,1781.574,"No, with all due respect, Your Honor, that was not my answer."
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.532,1788.265,"So, once Officer--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1788.265,1788.888,But--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1788.888,1799.067,"--once Officer Reese made his comment, there was no circumstance, even a week, a month... relatives come in and say,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1809.378,1809.548,--The better--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.548,1809.989,--the police.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1809.989,1815.197,"--In my opinion, the better policy, the better practice, is that there should not be."
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.457,1815.928,You're not helping--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1815.928,1815.999,--if the--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.999,1816.229,"--defendants, you know."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1816.229,1816.49,--if I--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.49,1819.488,"In some cases, you are not helping defendants."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1819.488,1820.121,--Well--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.121,1824.954,"Sometimes, a defendant, after he talks to his relatives, might conclude,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1831.624,1832.267,--In my--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.267,1840.242,"--once the police make a misstatement, he can never come forward and say, ""I want to confess""."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1840.242,1848.316,"--In my 20 years of trial practice, I have never found it to be at the defendant's best interest to communicate with the police without counsel."
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.896,1849.377,Mr. Ravenell--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1849.377,1850.061,--never found it to be--
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.061,1856.34,"--you are defending a judgment that no court in Maryland, as far as I know, ever made."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1869.098,1869.449,--Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1869.449,1873.621,"So, let's take the case as it comes to us."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1873.621,1873.811,Sure.
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.811,1876.861,The taint can be removed.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1877.845,1878.536,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.536,1884.655,"Accepting that to be the law, what, in your judgment, would it take to remove the taint +/?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1889.398,1892.687,I'll be happy to participate in that conversation.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.289,1923.319,Suppose--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1923.319,1925.535,"""You do not face the death penalty. """
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.535,1927.451,"--suppose, again, we do not accept that position."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1931.481,1943.611,"I don't agree that I need another fallback position, because I believe that if the Court finds that right to counsel... giving him counsel is not enough, other things I'm about to tell the Court, I think, will also be a factor."
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1970.188,1970.671,"Well, Johns--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1970.671,1970.951,"--""# against you""."
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1970.951,1972.645,"--Johns, in effect, did that here."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1972.645,1973.59,We disagree.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.59,1978.585,"Certainly, one of the best curative devices is immediate correction from a superior."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,1980.229,1991.583,"Interestingly, what Your Honor said in the Seibert case is that when... and, in fact, the plurality opinion... when you give an alleged cure in the midst of the violation, the defendant misses it."
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.565,2002.415,"So, you think you'd have a stronger case if Johns hadn't corrected Reese?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2002.415,2003.056,--I think that... I think--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.056,2003.789,That's--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2003.789,2004.029,--what we would have--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.029,2004.61,--But--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2004.61,2004.861,--is a stronger--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.861,2005.203,--that's a--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2005.203,2005.353,--case.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.353,2005.874,--far stretch.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2006.114,2006.455,No.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.098,2040.249,Well--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2040.249,2040.489,--Johns--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.489,2040.96,"--Well, you don't want the--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2040.96,2041.12,--says--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.12,2043.667,--you don't want the officer talking to Blake directly.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2045.664,2045.995,--No.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.958,2051.478,But it seems--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2051.478,2051.679,One of the things--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.679,2062.741,"--to me that it's a bit much to say that the problem is that the... he didn't talk to Blake directly, because that gets into another extended dialogue with the defendant that the defendant has not initiated."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2070.074,2083.415,"--With all due respect, I couldn't disagree more, because I think what has to be is that there has to be a direct comment to the suspect so that the suspect understands that this violation occurred,"
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.981,2132.151,Well--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2132.151,2133.205,--that he was in before.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.205,2140.636,"--what about just simple thing like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said, that he listens to in his cell,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2150.908,2151.609,And--
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.609,2154.94,"So, suppose Johns had said to the defendant,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2181.648,2185.267,"--I think that if that was done, then we are moving in the right direction."
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.902,2190.563,"--The right direction would be to say, ""Please don't talk to us""."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2190.563,2197.123,The right direction would be--
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2251.258,2255.561,"Counsel, there's no dispute about the historical facts found by the judge."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2259.533,2259.783,--Right.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2259.783,2261.538,Those are factual questions.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2274.577,2279.941,And what the Chief Justice says was true in Bradshaw and in Edwards and in Elstad.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2279.941,2280.794,I will ask--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.794,2287.614,"All questions, which were mixed questions of law and fact, where this Court took the words, took the facts, and made a rule."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2289.319,2298.417,"--I will direct the Court to two cases, Salve Regina College versus Russell, 499 U.S. 225, where this Court said the following,"

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2331.025,2334.797,"--I find that interesting, Your Honor, because the Court did the same thing Elstad."
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.534,2377.904,"Well, are you--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2377.904,2378.347,There is no reason--
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.347,2378.667,--arguing that--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2378.667,2379.198,--to be different here.
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.198,2390.314,"--are you arguing that trial court, even though there's agreement... understanding on most of the historical facts, is still in a better position to make the judgment call as to whether it was voluntary or not?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2390.314,2390.804,"Yes, I am."
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.909,2534.455,What was the quote from the SG's brief?

2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.999,2537.334,--And what did they say?

2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.095,2544.424,Maybe they said that.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2561.443,2561.704,--I'm sorry.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2604.011,2604.412,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.412,2608.734,--not that his decision to talk to the police was coerced.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2620.509,2621.162,--in State--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.162,2622.284,--about what the SG has conceded.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2622.284,2622.466,--Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.466,2628.333,He has conceded that if the... if it is found by the court that the statement given was a--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2628.333,2628.724,Right.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.724,2633.709,"--coerced statement, in that event, it would be unusable for any purpose."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2633.709,2634.26,All right.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2634.851,2639.426,"And the... and the Court of Appeals of Maryland said,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2643.015,2643.157,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2643.157,2645.132,And that's what we're reviewing here.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2645.132,2676.546,"And I think that when we review that in a mixed question of fact or law, giving all deference to the trial court's finding, as this Court has in the past in the cases I've cited, that, in fact, there is... was a violation, the violation was not cured, and that, even if this Court establishes curative measures, those measures must be designed to put the suspect back in the position that he was in prior to the police violation of his rights."
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.291,2727.67,"Yes, but if you're looking... if you're taking your standard seriously--"

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2733.015,2733.389,Sure.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.389,2735.193,"--the reason that you'd have to say,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2744.662,2744.852,Right.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2764.079,2764.332,Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.332,2765.403,--of the wrongful statement.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2765.403,2765.656,Exactly.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.656,2767.56,"The implication was,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2770.358,2771.161,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.161,2783.689,"But if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2783.689,2784.552,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.552,2785.313,So timely--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2785.313,2790.048,But there is no finding to support the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that concerned him.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2795.725,2796.206,Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2796.206,2796.787,--presumably implicated him--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2796.787,2796.937,Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.937,2797.178,--Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.178,2797.68,--too far.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2798.211,2798.481,And the trial--
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2798.481,2801.399,--There's just no finding that it was simply the death penalty that--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2801.399,2801.692,--I agree.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2812.394,2812.615,--And--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2812.615,2812.795,--understood--

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2835.241,2835.491,--it was their burden--
2005.04-373,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.491,2837.486,--maybe you should modify the standard.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2878.661,2878.953,--Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.901,2885.502,May I interrupt--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2885.502,2885.823,--to do.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2886.696,2886.916,Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.916,2901.099,"You seem to have taken the position that the State cannot cure an Edwards violation, which seems to me quite different from the trial court's ruling, because the trial court made a number of factual statements that seem to me to be saying,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2924.028,2925.06,Correct.

2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.148,2932.389,"So, that--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2932.389,2932.94,--can be a cure.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2938.475,2938.878,No.
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.092,2940.453,And when the trial judge--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2940.453,2941.024,--it clear that--
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2941.024,2943.904,"--said they did not cure because they didn't do any of A, B--"

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2944.955,2951.296,I agree that I do not need this Court to find that Edwards versus Arizona remains untouched for me to win.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2982.35,2982.69,Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.69,2985.376,--you could... you could surely cure it in some fairness.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,2985.376,2994.523,"I certainly believe that, from the teachings of Seibert and from other cases, that this Court clearly seemed to be leaning towards cure, that there can be cures."

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3014.955,3015.197,--Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.197,3019.299,--let me tell you the problem... the problem I have in the case--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3019.299,3019.49,Sure.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.49,3021.635,--and with your reliance on the trial court's findings.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3052.147,3054.455,I think that the problem is--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.455,3056.42,That is the issue in these cases--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3056.42,3056.771,--I think the problem--
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.771,3062.407,--whether the police initiated the conversation that produced the confession.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3062.407,3072.179,--And I think that all those things are factors that the Court can consider in deciding whether Blake voluntarily initiated the contact.
2005.04-373,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.179,3073.18,"No, I don't think so."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3083.892,3095.697,"Your Honor, with all due respect, this Court, in Elstad and in Seibert, said that psychological pressures, which are very similar to the fruits analysis, can be considered on whether there's a Fifth Amendment violation."
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.697,3096.461,I--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3096.461,3096.851,In fact--

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3109.178,3109.418,--Correct.

2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3112.39,3112.66,It is.
2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3112.66,3121.877,"--that the police asked the question, and then the trial judge said the... what Blake said was an answer to that question."

2005.04-373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.184,3139.598,--we're dealing with in this case.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3139.598,3140.489,--And I agree.
2005.04-373,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3180.109,3196.689,"So, your position, I guess, is... I think it is, in your last answer... that we really shouldn't be phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the suspect's statement, at this point."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3209.166,3209.699,Which is what the--
2005.04-373,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3209.699,3210.55,That's the way you would phrase the--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3210.55,3210.73,--Yes.
2005.04-373,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.73,3211.443,--issue for us.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3211.443,3213.178,And which is what the trial judge did below.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.173,3235.333,Well--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3235.333,3235.964,--trust them with it.
2005.04-373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.964,3247.44,"--absent of good cop/bad cop finding, and I... and I repeat that they've credited Johns' testimony here... this seems to me a very odd sort of interrogation, to say,"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3251.361,3253.057,"Well, I would say this."
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3291.091,3291.683,"Counsel, is my--"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3291.683,3292.094,--be the same way.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3292.094,3302.305,"--is my understanding of the Maryland law in effect when this happened correct that if you prevail on suppression, your client cannot face charges, no matter what the other evidence is?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3302.305,3306.015,"Not if we prevail on suppression, no."
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.634,3318.915,Right.
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3318.915,3326.766,"--but the law at the time was that if the State was not successful on appeal, it would be barred from prosecuting Mr. Blake."
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.536,3329.816,But that--
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3329.816,3330.75,--at the time of suppression.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3330.75,3334.269,"--that law applies to this case at this time, correct?"
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3334.269,3334.559,Correct.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3343.567,3344.371,"Thank you, Mr. Ravenell."
2005.04-373,2,33960,kenneth_w_ravenell,,3344.371,3345.052,Thank you.
2005.04-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3345.052,3348.533,"Ms. Graeff, you have 5 minutes remaining."
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3348.533,3349.164,Thank you.
2005.04-373,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3379.155,3383.176,How about the trial judge's determination?
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3388.632,3389.055,Yes.
2005.04-373,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3389.055,3395.413,And the trial judge then finds there was an answer to that question.
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3403.838,3410.488,"Well, whether there was a cure, and whether he initiated, it's the State's position to be a mixed of question of fact and law."
2005.04-373,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3432.844,3438.109,"Is it fact, or is it not fact, law, in respect to the following?"
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3460.989,3465.17,"I think that is a fact, but, under Seibert and Elstad, is not the proper analysis."
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.358,3531.67,"May I ask one question before you sit down, if you're through?"
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3540.95,3544.258,"My reading is, she found, on the facts here, it was not cured."
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3544.258,3548.621,"So that, your... the answer to your... the question presented in your cert petition really is answered."
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3550.055,3551.932,"Well, it depends what can--"
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3551.932,3554.117,Because the question you asked is whether it can be cured.
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3554.117,3558.471,"--Well, this Court has never addressed... and, in fact, there is disagreement here as to whether it can be cured."
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.727,3564.528,But you do agree--
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3564.528,3564.888,--it's cured--
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3564.888,3566.996,--that the trial judge did assume it could be cured.
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3566.996,3572.383,"--Well, she looked at... she looked at... I guess it's difficult to understand exactly."
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3581.291,3582.232,"And so, there could have been a cure."
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3582.232,3583.205,Yes.
2005.04-373,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3583.205,3583.596,Yes.
2005.04-373,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3583.596,3590.125,"If you lose this case, can the defendant be prosecuted federally under the carjacking statute?"
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3590.125,3592.823,I'm not aware.
2005.04-373,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3602.582,3602.975,But--
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3602.975,3603.145,--the State court.
2005.04-373,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3603.145,3607.758,--the prosecutors were well aware of that when they determined to appeal.
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3607.758,3608.521,Yes.
2005.04-373,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3608.521,3613.877,But perhaps they were worried that they didn't have a case without the defendant's statements.
2005.04-373,3,33839,kathryn_grill_graeff,,3613.877,3617.447,The statute puts the State in a difficult position.
2005.04-373,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3642.05,3642.903,"Thank you, Counsel."
