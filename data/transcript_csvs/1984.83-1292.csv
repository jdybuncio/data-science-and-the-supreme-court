1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.314,We will hear arguments first this morning in Wayte against the United States.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,9.316,25.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, a system of justice must of course take advantage of confessions and eye witness reports of criminal activity."
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,79.926,88.671,Wouldn't it be fair to say that most of the people who fail to register are opponents of the registration process?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,88.671,98.056,"Chief Justice Burger, there were hearings before a Congressional Committee as to the causes of individuals who did not register."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.225,156.627,What does that term mean in the sense of skewed or non-typical?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,156.627,176.93,"--It meant that out of an entire pool of nonregistrants, individuals who had a variety of reasons for not registering, the only individuals who in fact would be selected, would be singled out, would be those who had actively protested, either by writing the President of the United States or by speaking out against the draft itself."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.93,185.464,"But you are going to single out by some method, have some system for prosecution, so in that sense any system is ""skewed"" in your terms, isn't it?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,185.464,190.539,Any system singles out certain individuals for investigation and prosecution.
1984.83-1292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,202.247,208.312,"May I ask, of the total pool I think you mentioned 500,000 or 600,000."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,208.312,209.161,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,209.161,217.258,How many of those have been identified by the government as nonregistrants at the time the 15 suits were filed?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,217.258,222.78,That is an interesting question that goes to the nature of the government's enforcement policy.
1984.83-1292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,267.61,277.445,Is my recollection incorrect that the government had explored various ways of ascertaining the identity of a much larger number of a pool?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,277.445,279.886,"Let me answer that in two respects, Justice--"
1984.83-1292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,279.886,280.888,Is that true?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,280.888,294.098,--It is not true that the government at the time that these individuals had been prosecuted had in fact made a determination to investigate or prosecute by any other system than the passive enforcement system.
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.603,411.614,"Mr. Rosenbaum, what was the occasion for your questioning Mr. Klein?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,411.614,419.441,It was in the course of a hearing before the District Court on the question of the propriety of the prosecution system which the government had employed.
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.441,423.281,The District Court allowed you to take a deposition like that?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,423.281,424.603,It was in open hearing.
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.755,428.985,Requested by you?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,428.985,440.585,"--Requested by us, but we made a prima facie showing which the District Court found that individuals had been singled out by virtue of their expression of political rights."
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.585,466.52,"Mr. Rosenbaum, it sounded to me in looking at the record as though in the court below you had proceeded on a selective prosecution theory, and that up in this Court now you are approaching the problem much as you would in attacking a statute which on its face burdens First Amendment rights."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,470.412,471.113,No.
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.601,485.392,Have you abandoned then--
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,485.392,485.813,--No.
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.813,488.424,--the selective prosecution ground?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,488.424,499.774,"We have not abandoned the argument that there was intentional discrimination, that Judge Hatter found that intentional discrimination, and that the Ninth Circuit was incorrect in reversing."
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.052,545.534,"Well, you don't want us to address that, then?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,548.365,550.026,I am stating to the Court--
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.026,551.978,"They can't, of course, raise an issue."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,553.859,554.92,--No.
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.336,594.284,"Well, on that point, is it not true that the policy of the government also incorporated prosecution of those reported by third parties--"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,594.284,594.745,--Yes.
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.745,595.626,--to be violated?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,595.626,596.247,"Yes, and--"
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,596.247,598.228,So it isn't quite as you have described it.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,598.228,609.213,"--No, Justice O'Connor, the government's argument that the third policy reporting provision doesn't save the First Amendment matter in this case for the government."
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.474,638.874,But not necessarily.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,645.078,651.442,"Yes, but the high probability which the government recognized was in fact the case."
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.073,710.361,But you concede that the stated policy would have admitted that prosecutions would be based also on third party reports.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,710.361,731.064,"I would concede that only if we regard this case in a most abstract sense, and not look in the real world, as the government itself understood, how in fact it would be enforced, that the possibility of a significant number of individuals reported by methods not related to use of speech, exercise of speech, could be involved."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.753,780.906,"Mr. Rosenbaum, can I ask you a question before I lose the... I think it is relevant to what you are saying."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,788.971,796.648,"I believe the first group was around 130, and by the time the matter was completed, it may have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 900 or 1,000."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.648,800.949,And what happened to the other 987?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,800.949,811.637,"The government had a policy which is colloquially referred to as the beg policy, in which the government would say to an individual, we have information that you are not registered."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.38,817.691,You don't... it won't be prosecuted.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,821.063,822.003,"Yes, they did."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.003,827.316,"So within the group of 1,000, was there discrimination against these 13 because of what they said?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,827.316,837.794,"It is true that the individuals who were singled out for the actual prosecution were those that were most adamant, and that it was the use of that speech--"
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.794,840.576,They are the ones who refused to take advantage of the government's offer.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,840.576,843.847,"--That's correct, but the beg system in addition--"
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.847,855.665,"And would you not say that they were treated... they were not discriminated against as contrasted with the other members of this... if we limit the universe for a moment to 1,000 persons, were they treated differently than the 1,000?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,855.665,864.962,"--Well, in the sense, Justice Stevens, that the actual prosecutions were limited to persons who in fact stated their dissent most vigorously."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.033,868.365,"Well, they are the ones who refused to register."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,868.365,869.464,--That's correct.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.464,872.576,"It doesn't matter what words they used in stating... they said, no, we won't register."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,875.018,875.979,That's correct.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.241,883.472,Do you think that they have no right to prosecute somebody for saying I will not register?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,883.472,890.738,"No, I think the government has an absolute right to prosecute an individual who says I will not register, or that... admits a confession of any kind."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.738,899.825,"After they identify 1,000 people who... by some public means they cannot select the 13 out of that 1,000 who won't register?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,899.825,907.018,"No, no objection to prosecuting individuals as an abstract matter who say that they will not register."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.405,916.287,"Were 1,000, not 13."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,916.287,925.96,"--Yes, but that 1,000 was a sample of individuals who had either written the President their opposition or who had expressed publicly their opposition."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.96,928.133,"Their opposition, or their unwillingness to register?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,928.133,929.924,"Their opposition, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.924,932.245,"Do you know that as to all 1,000?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,932.245,947.446,"I know that the government itself recognized from the outset that the individuals who would be singled out for the application of the beg policy, that is, the individuals who would be investigated and prosecuted, would be individuals who were protesting, not registrants."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.969,954.559,Were there no people called to the attention of the government by informers?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,954.559,955.28,--There is no--
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.28,959.314,"Somebody might get up at a meeting and say, I'd like everybody else to register, but they are never going to catch me."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,962.526,973.022,"--If an individual had been reported in that method, then that individual would have been reported as a result of making a public statement expressing a particular opposition."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.022,976.224,"Well, no, I am saying he is not... he is just opposed to being registered himself."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,982.989,983.49,No.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.49,984.85,Someone might be offended by that and call the--
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,984.85,986.412,No example of that in the record.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.302,991.465,"--Do we know about most of these 1,000 people?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,992.805,1002.943,We know that the government understood from the outset that these would be the individuals who would be either writing the President or who would be speaking out and would be making religious or moral objection.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.373,1007.713,The thing that puzzles me... I don't mean to debate with you.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1017.11,1028.988,"--Well, the fact that they may have changed their mind when the chips were down, the fact that these were the most fervent believers, the most fervent dissenters, doesn't mean that the remainder of that 1,000 had not also expressed their dissent."
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.037,1055.235,"You are assuming that these other 900 all made precisely the same kind of public speeches as the 13, and if that is true, then they were not indicted because of their speech, because they were permitted to register, so the speech really becomes irrelevant."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1055.235,1055.706,--No.
1984.83-1292,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.706,1058.54,If you assume they all said the same thing as the 13.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1058.54,1062.562,"What we are concerned about, Justice Stevens, is an enforcement system."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.614,1135.87,"But isn't that a perfectly legitimate position for the government to take, to say that so far as violators of the law are concerned, silence is golden, that it is more important for the government as a law enforcement policy to prosecute violators who publicly proclaim their violation then violators who don't publicly proclaim their violation?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1135.87,1146.275,"--If this were a reasonable enforcement system, indeed, if this were an enforcement system as for every other law in the United States that I am aware of, your argument would be correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.275,1151.58,"But you know, there aren't a whole bunch of drug pusher that are getting up and saying, I oppose the drug laws."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1155.552,1157.164,"Yes, and that is precisely the point."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.164,1164.708,"So you say if the government applied this policy in all other areas, is there any evidence that it doesn't apply it in other areas?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1164.708,1167.89,"Yes, there's absolutely no evidence that it is applied in other areas, but the--"
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1167.89,1171.483,"Well, you say there is no evidence that it is applied in other areas."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1175.157,1179.778,"--I would affirmatively state that it is not applied in any other area, and the--"
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.778,1189.866,"In other words, that there are examples of other kinds of law violators who get up and publicly proclaim they are violating the law, and the government nevertheless does not apply a passive policy?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1189.866,1190.685,--Yes.
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.377,1193.867,What areas are these?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1193.867,1198.321,There are a variety of areas for individuals such as the O'Brien statute.
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.321,1200.732,"That was, what, 20 years ago?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1203.694,1211.789,"There would be other areas where an individual might state a difference, but--"
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.789,1221.295,"You say might, but I thought you said a minute ago that you affirmatively stated that the government didn't apply the same policy in other areas."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1221.295,1234.004,"--The difference... it does not... the government applies in no other area, Justice Rehnquist, in the way of answering your question, an enforcement policy that absolutely doesn't apply to individuals that don't speak up."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.786,1245.952,"What are other areas, Mr. Rosenbaum, in prosecuting a federal law violation other than Selective Service where individuals do speak up?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1245.952,1252.435,"--Well, there may be... in a Census statute."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.17,1320.261,"But surely the government can move one step at a time, and feel that its of primary importance with a limited budget to get the vocal people, and then if they successfully prosecute a few of them, undoubtedly there would be other remedies brought to bear."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1320.261,1321.573,"No, I would disagree with you, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.563,1370.016,"Well, surely the government has a great deal of discretion."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1375.479,1401.325,"--The government can pick out any system it chooses, as long as it does not select a content-based, speech-activated system that only singles out for investigation and prosecution individuals who state their protests to the government, and a system which says to everyone else, if you are silent, if you do not exercise your First Amendment rights, you will be absolutely guaranteed that you will not be investigated or prosecuted."
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1401.325,1403.316,Did the government ever do anything like that?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1403.316,1404.097,Excuse me?
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.097,1405.967,Did they ever do anything like that?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1405.967,1409.26,That is precisely what the government has done in this particular case.
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1410.402,1412.114,Where do we find that in the record?
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1412.114,1422.83,"--The government acknowledged in the record that the only individuals that in fact would be selected would be, to use the government's words, individuals who were vocal proponents of nonregistration--"
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1422.83,1446.355,"Suppose these people who were concerned about... started a campaign and said that everyone who is opposed to this draft would meet down at the memorial where the Vietnam names are listed, and we will hold a demonstration, and so 10,000 young people, young men show up there."
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1475.984,1479.845,"--First, the intent of the government is not what is critical."
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.042,1543.178,"Well, Mr. Rosenbaum, somebody who vocally protests the draft but registers is not prosecuted, right?"
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1543.178,1545.258,Excuse me?
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1545.258,1551.753,Someone who vocally protests the draft but nevertheless registers is not prosecuted under this policy.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1551.753,1553.065,"Yes, but the issue in the case is not--"
1984.83-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1553.065,1565.013,And so it does appear as though what the government is doing is prosecuting those who don't register under their policy of giving people a chance to register and not be prosecuted.
1984.83-1292,0,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1565.013,1569.024,--The issue in this case is not whether registrants are permitted to speak out.
1984.83-1292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1608.791,1610.273,Very well.
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1613.425,1627.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I want to correct any misimpression that might exist as to the facts of this case, particularly how this program operated, some of the problems that the government raised, and how it went about solving them."
1984.83-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.808,1799.993,"What you are saying then is that the government received a number of letters complaining, or protesting the policy of the draft which did not announce that the writer was eligible for registration and refused to register, and the government did not investigate whether or not there might be liability for registration on the part of a writer who did not state that he--"
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1799.993,1801.142,Precisely.
1984.83-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.408,1812.312,"--I thought there were some in the group who after investigation it was determined they were over age, or something like that."
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1812.312,1821.806,"Yes, that is correct, but in the initial letter, they might have said, I am not going to register for the draft, and that would put them into the pool of 1,000, but it is true that--"
1984.83-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.806,1824.14,"They might have said it even though they weren't required, is what you are saying."
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1824.14,1824.5,--That is correct.
1984.83-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.733,1833.416,"General Lee, did the pool also include those reported by third parties?"
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1833.416,1834.756,"--It did, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1834.756,1838.9,Does the record tell us how many people would be included?
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1838.9,1849.605,"Yes, it does, and that's about the only thing that the record tells us about those 1,000 people, is that a little over half of them were third party reported."
1984.83-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.294,1879.565,May I ask just while you are right on that point--
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1879.565,1880.046,Yes.
1984.83-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.046,1891.105,"--General Lee, the 500 or so that are third party reported, your adversaries say, well, they really are not different, because they were only third party reported because they were vocal in the first instance, so they really should be treated alike."
1984.83-1292,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1891.105,1895.898,There is nothing in the record that would shed any light on that one way or the other.
1984.83-1292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2543.283,2545.925,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Rosenbaum?"
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2545.925,2548.145,"I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.231,2665.792,May I ask one question here?
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2665.792,2666.353,--Sure.
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.353,2670.887,"How could the government cure its mistake, accepting your theory of the whole case?"
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2679.884,2682.418,"Well, they don't have to indict as many as 700,000."
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.418,2691.853,"They require everybody to register by enforcing the beg policy, they find everybody, and your people still refuse to register."
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2693.525,2703.809,"Yes, as long as we look at that policy and say that it can be applied to both those who speak out and those who don't speak out, the policy is sound."
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.585,2714.047,"Well, you are not going to persuade me on the tax case."
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2724.243,2724.844,That's correct.
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.146,2743.738,You would apply this... it is not the fact that it is a draft case.
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2755.565,2757.726,"Well, I don't think smoking in the elevator--"
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.726,2760.598,There are people who feel very strongly about the right to smoke.
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2761.229,2765.042,"--If this Court held that that was an exercise of First Amendment rights, certainly that--"
1984.83-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.042,2768.735,"What if he writes a letter in exactly the same pattern, but it is a different violation?"
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2768.735,2771.777,"--Yes, and that is in response to Justice Rehnquist's point before."
1984.83-1292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.998,2809.811,I think you have answered the question.
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2841.291,2850.357,--I assume in your system you are indicating that these individuals would identify themselves by writing the Governor of the State of Virginia or speaking out.
1984.83-1292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.459,2860.025,"Right, and a lot of their neighbors who think handguns ought to be registered write a letter to the local prosecutor and say, why aren't you going after this fellow?"
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2860.025,2860.646,--Yes.
1984.83-1292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2860.646,2861.487,And so they indict him.
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2861.487,2870.884,"As long as that system had, as Justice Stevens indicated, a component that would say, not only those people who are speaking out can be prosecuted."
1984.83-1292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.429,2882.451,How are you going to find out who has a handgun in his house that is not registered?
1984.83-1292,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2900.934,2902.797,"There are two answers to that, Chief Justice Burger."
1984.83-1292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.932,2958.723,Thank you.
