2003.02-1624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.669,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1624, the Elk Grove Unified School District and David W. Gordon v. Michael A. Newdow."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,75.38,79.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1624,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.08,143.617,Counsel--
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,143.617,144.072,--has limited--
2003.02-1624,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.072,155.877,"--Counsel, on the standing issue, normally, I guess, we defer to the courts of appeals in deciding issues of state law."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,179.283,185.865,"--Well, it is our position, Your Honor, that the Ninth Circuit made an incorrect analysis in--"
2003.02-1624,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.865,196.267,"Well, maybe they did, but is it not the case that we normally defer to courts of appeals on questions of state law on issues of standing?"
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,196.267,198.974,--I would say the Court does defer at times.
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.452,230.514,"Is this just a question of Article III standing or would it be open to us under our precedents to say that we think there's Article III standing, but this really involves rights of third parties, and as a prudential matter, we do not think it's appropriate to exercise jurisdiction--"
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,230.514,231.507,"--I think, Justice--"
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.507,239.142,"--Because, as I understand certainly the Government's brief, and I think yours, you don't argue prudential standing, it's just a question, an Article III question."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,240.507,245.829,"--Well, I would say both, Your Honor, that the respondent is not a stakeholder within the meaning of Article III."
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.405,266.884,"--Well, I... I saw the Rooker-Feldman cite."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,282.282,294.848,"I don't know that it... this case fits precisely in either the Rooker-Feldman or other prudential cases, but we do have a case that certainly merits that type of consideration."
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.886,326.122,"Well, then that gets us to Article III, the father says that it's not a level playing field, that he has a right under state law and he might even have a constitutional right to have some access to the... to the child and to try to affect the child's development, and that the state is tilting the balance, unconstitutionally he could say."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,326.122,329.344,"--Well, we would certainly disagree with that position, Your Honor."
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.344,331.489,"Well, but I mean, that's... it's just a question of standing."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,334.461,342.718,"Well, I think it's... the best way to approach this is whether respondent has a legally protected interest, which he does not."
2003.02-1624,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.45,353.908,"Well, he's... he's... may I ask you on the question of legally protected right to zero in on this."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,409.803,423.428,"--I have to answer that question, Justice Souter, based upon how the school district perceives respondent's rights, and in this case, the school district must look to only a single decision-maker."
2003.02-1624,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,430.403,434.406,"Well, the mother isn't a decision-maker for the school district, neither is the father a decision-maker."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,455.311,463.385,"We would submit, Justice Souter, that the question is truly what is in the best interest of the child."
2003.02-1624,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.065,477.298,But aren't... aren't you basically answering the question as if I were asking you a next friend standing question?
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,491.21,495.297,"With limited rights, his rights become on a more abstract level."
2003.02-1624,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.015,504.212,California says otherwise.
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,513.212,527.042,"--The reason, Justice Kennedy, that we look to the state law to define those rights is that because when there are custody disputes, the court directs which parent gets the ultimate decision-making responsibility and authority."
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.331,529.81,"Yes, but the judge didn't tell him to... to discontinue the litigation, did he?"
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,533.525,540.545,"--We would submit, Justice Stevens, that the state judge cannot determine an Article III standing."
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.038,546.239,"Well, he could certainly tell the father, this is not in the best interest of the child, discontinue the litigation."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,553.177,566.756,"--But when the respondent bypasses the state court, the respond... the record reflects that respondent and the mother met with the principal and the kindergarten teacher of the daughter and respondent wanted to--"
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.756,570.1,But that doesn't go to the question of whether he can maintain the litigation.
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,570.1,571.465,--But--
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.465,573.981,That's a standing issue as to whether he can bring this lawsuit.
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,573.981,582.072,"--But certainly if he bypasses the state court and never has a determination made as to whether this is in the best interest of the daughter, you're correct."
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.453,584.839,But she never asked for a relief along that line.
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,589.957,599.039,"Well, she certainly sought dismissal in a... in a manner of speaking from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and/or to intervene to... to demonstrate to the--"
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.039,599.245,And I think--
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,599.245,601.846,--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as to what was in the best interest of her daughter.
2003.02-1624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.846,605.811,"--Yeah, but the judge said the daughter could go hear him argue the case as I understand it."
2003.02-1624,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,605.811,610.391,But likewise in this Court the judge said she could not.
2003.02-1624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.111,677.347,"Very well, Mr. Cassidy."
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,679.372,692.951,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.041,728.867,"Well, he says, I have my own rights."
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,738.776,739.481,"Well, it's--"
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,739.481,747.776,--in... consistent with her going to school and with her mother and that's... and the state set up an unfair playing field.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,747.776,762.553,"--Well, we submit, Justice Kennedy, that a fair reading of what... what the domestic relations court, which considered the best interests of the child, focused in on the legally protected rights of the... with respect to this child's education."
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.909,828.357,One... one more question on standing.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,832.815,835.227,"--We... we do also, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.227,836.325,--What's your best authority?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,836.325,838.843,"Well, I... first of all, there's two."
2003.02-1624,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.493,884.828,"Is this your argument, Mr. Olson?"
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,927.636,943.156,"That's... that's absolutely correct, Justice Souter, and I think that's consistent with the so-called domestic relations exception, the... and the... and the court in that case recognized the special expertise of family courts with continuing jurisdiction with respect to sensitive matters."
2003.02-1624,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.698,951.496,But the... the merits here certainly have nothing to do with domestic relations.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,951.496,974.159,"--The... well, and they do in the sense that they... the... the matters that are before this Court with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance in the public school has to do with the child's education and impacts with respect... and there is in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, affidavits from the mother expressing her concern about the effect on the child of being thrust into the vortex of this constitutional case."
2003.02-1624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.292,1026.542,Do you mean repeatedly held or repeatedly said?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1026.542,1035.253,"--Repeatedly said and in the... in the... in the sense of Seminole Tribe, Justice Stevens, this is more than dicta."
2003.02-1624,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.072,1080.93,Without benefit of brief and oral argument.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1080.93,1104.336,"Well, they... there were references to the case in... of... of course in the briefs and... and in connection with the case, but the fact is that the Court was distinguishing, and the Court repeatedly said that, that there is a major distinction between those purely religious exercises such as prayers or recitation of the Ten Commandments, or in the evolution cases."
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.418,1142.852,Do you think the state or the school district has the obligation to excuse from the classroom a child whose parents disagree with the pledge?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1142.852,1144.05,"Yes, and it does."
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.74,1150.033,There... there is that... that... that constitutional right?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1150.033,1153.005,"Yes, and that has been addressed, of course, in... throughout the brief."
2003.02-1624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1153.005,1157.442,Why... why is that if this is not a prayer or not an exercise?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1157.442,1170.345,"Well, the... the Court held in West Virginia v. Barnette that persons of conscience being concerned about expressing allegiance to... and that case occurred at a time before the pledge was amended."
2003.02-1624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.345,1171.664,"Well, that was not a prayer either."
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1173.439,1184.091,"That was the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, but... but that's the same thing that's happening here, Mr. Chief Justice, that the child are excused from reciting the... the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag."
2003.02-1624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.122,1196.146,They've expressed the view it's just a ceremonial matter.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1204.608,1209.771,"--Well, I think that the, as this, the language of the Justices of this Court have expressed that--"
2003.02-1624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.771,1209.959,"Well, forget the--"
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1209.959,1210.414,--because of--
2003.02-1624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.414,1212.438,"--forget the, forget all that dicta for just a moment."
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1219.99,1223.871,"--Yes and no, and I would like to answer, explain if I may."
2003.02-1624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.077,1225.646,Because it's a terribly important question.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1225.646,1253.427,"It's an important question because the reference to under God in the pledge, as numerous decisions of this Court have indicated in dicta, what as a part of a... of a thought process of coming about to the conclusion that it... it is an acknowledgment of the religious basis of the framers of the Constitution, who believed not only that the right to revolt, but that the right to vest power in the people to create a government became... came as a result of religious principles."
2003.02-1624,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.203,1301.724,Your... your argument is that there's a stronger case now than there would have been 50 years ago?
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1301.724,1314.606,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that is for many reasons, for... because of the reason that I just made, but also because the Congress revisited this issue in 2002 after the decision below in this case."
2003.02-1624,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.488,1412.239,"Well, why not have it like oath or affirmation?"
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1426.189,1426.644,"--Well, they don't."
2003.02-1624,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.296,1429.782,But they can be... take part in the pledge.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1429.782,1431.434,--They can take part in the pledge--
2003.02-1624,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.434,1431.64,In their own way.
2003.02-1624,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1431.64,1433.497,--without saying any words.
2003.02-1624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.924,1569.723,"Thank you, General Olson."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1573.317,1573.689,"Yes, you are."
2003.02-1624,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.689,1575.379,Please proceed.
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1575.379,1577.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1624,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.302,1622.851,"Well now, let's... let's talk first about standing."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1702.727,1704.297,I would answer that in two ways.
2003.02-1624,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.445,1742.563,"Maybe so, maybe no, but the rule of standing is that the person who brings the suit has to affirm that they have that stake now when the suit is brought, and she doesn't."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1742.563,1745.042,"Correct, but I'm not bringing this in her behalf, that was taken out."
2003.02-1624,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1747.187,1758.583,"That's... that's a different point altogether, but if she has no standing, then it seems to me the next question is whether or not the rights that you assert, and I understand what they are, do seem to undercut her position."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1758.583,1761.099,"--They may well do that, but she's a separate entity."
2003.02-1624,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.128,1769.644,"Yet... but see, then... then you're getting back to your daughter."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1783.806,1785.664,"--And I agree with that, Your Honor."
2003.02-1624,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.302,1809.729,"Well, she does have a right not to participate."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1809.729,1815.097,"--She has a... yes, except under Lee v. Weisman she's clearly coerced to participate."
2003.02-1624,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.955,1817.781,That was a prayer.
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1817.781,1823.299,"--Well, I'm not sure this isn't a prayer, and I'm... I am sure that the Establishment Clause does not require prayer."
2003.02-1624,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.757,1842.041,"Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people could look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer."
2003.02-1624,2,36419,michael_a_newdow,,1842.041,1844.892,"--Well, President Bush said it does constitute a prayer."
2003.02-1624,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.892,1848.357,"Well, but he... we certainly don't take him as the final authority on this."
2003.02-1624,3,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3325.337,3333.51,I would like to take this opportunity to respond to several points.
2003.02-1624,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.607,3498.443,May I ask you just one question?
2003.02-1624,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.409,3505.689,I'd like you to comment on.
2003.02-1624,3,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3518.777,3543.79,"I would disagree, because we feel that the use of the term, one nation under God, reflects a political philosophy, and the political philosophy of our country, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence, is one is... that ours is one of a limited government, and that is the philosophy that's now more enhanced, more reflected in the 1954 act."
2003.02-1624,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3623.577,3625.502,"Thank you, Mr. Cassidy."
