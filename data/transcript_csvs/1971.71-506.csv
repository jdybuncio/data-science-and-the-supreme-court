1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.033,We will hear arguments next in number 71-506 United States against Midwest Video Corporation.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,54.291,58.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.808,309.764,"That notice announced that the commission would explore “how best to obtain consistent with the public interest standard of the Communications Act, the full benefits of developing communications technology for the public, with particular immediate reference to CATV technology and potential services.”"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,334.177,336.617,There is nothing in the Act on that subject.
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.617,341.001,It had to be a common carrier by wire to be subject I take it.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,341.001,350.247,"Well, we needn't reach that issue that there is nothing in the Act on that subject, it would still be communication by wire, there might be interstate aspects to it."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.247,354.18,Commission does have jurisdiction over interstate communications by wire?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,354.18,355.397,"Yes, it does."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.397,357.129,Are they common carriers?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,357.129,365.473,"Well under Southwestern, we don't think that that's limited to common carriers but this case no more in a Southwestern requires the court to reach that issue."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.473,378.619,"But if there was some real statutory authority, obvious statutory authority over just wired communications, we wouldn't have had this argument."
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,378.619,385.516,"Well, presumably, the Court of Appeals would have decided the case differently."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.973,390.475,Well but the commission would have decided it differently.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,390.475,392.689,Undoubtedly.
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,406.246,413.849,Has there been any amendment in this area since cable television emerged as a real --
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,413.849,415.532,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.259,520.239,Has it been -- it was the ordinary rulemaking function but has it been kind of a corporative effort with the -- trying to reach accommodation among the various competing interest.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,520.239,531.867,"Well, the commission has devoted a great deal of time and effort to that covering various subjects in the course of these rulemaking proceedings."
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.557,700.596,And this so-called new rules are these as of this February?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,700.596,703.98,"That is correct, sir."
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.995,944.339,Will you tell me again what cablecasting is?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,944.339,952.064,That is a programming over the cable that does not involve any broadcast signals or any broadcast originating program.
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.064,953.326,Wholly originated.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,953.326,980.857,"Wholly originated by the cablecaster although it may not necessarily be local programming, there can be programming that supply to him from elsewhere, including networking possibilities here, but it would not be programming that originates through radio signals that are being broadcast to other viewers."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.347,991.527,But no amended TV sets can received that?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,991.527,994.269,"That is correct, sir."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.269,998.802,"Then the origination doesn't really have controlling impact here, doesn't it?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1007.196,1008.53,That is a possibility.
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.278,1028.779,Primarily emphasis is to include local --
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1028.779,1044.509,"That is correct, Your Honor, but there is also the possibility of this networking including the use of satellites, which has been discussed in the course of these rulemaking proceedings as a possible way of networking cablecasting."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.197,1189.979,"Well, is all cable television pay television?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1189.979,1193.325,"Well, not not that kind but I am talking about it."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.325,1194.873,But it comes into your home by wire.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1194.873,1196.789,If there is a subscription fee.
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.789,1198.506,"It's a pay television, isn't it?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1198.506,1214.087,"In that sense, but now I am talking about the additional element of a per service or a per program fee that you can't get the particular program unless you pay a particular fee for it, such as we have with pay broadcast television."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.087,1225.802,"I noticed that Judge Gibson was somewhat exercised about the problems of advertising, is there advertising on cable television?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1225.802,1232.491,"Advertising it -- there isn't, with respect to the broadcast programming that is carried."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1232.491,1233.657,But not on those --
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1233.657,1242.062,But there -- it is now -- they can carry the advertising that is already put on the air by the broadcast.
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1242.062,1249.298,If they pick it up from a network or another station and then run it by cable into the private home they take it as it is.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1249.298,1255.781,"As it is, and they don't interfere with the advertising that is on it."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1255.781,1262.405,"But the cable television as such does not introduce advertising on the wire, is that right?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1262.405,1274.382,"Well, in their cablecasting operations, the commission has authorized them to introduce advertising, but only at natural breaks in the programming."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.759,1296.443,"Does that mean the viewers are going to pay a fee to get advertising piped into their homes and televisions, ever since department can --"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1296.443,1300.301,They all do operate with subscriber's fees.
1971.71-506,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.26,1324.22,Does that include political advertising?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1324.22,1329.379,"Well, they have the option to carry it just as broadcasting."
1971.71-506,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.379,1345.058,"Is there anything to stop the cable television company, and it operates in three counties in the state during the month of October carrying nothing but political advertising?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1345.058,1363.383,"There is nothing to stop them if they choose to limit their advertising that way, they do have the fairness doctrine requirements and the equal opportunities requirements to comply with, and in the commission's view, and not in the commission's rule, if the commission has authority to apply them."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.47,1617.318,There is no grandfather clause here.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1617.318,1620.689,There are some grandfather provisions involved.
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.199,1652.255,Or may be plenty of reasons for this but is your submission in terms of power that because a cablecaster does use broadcast signals that gives the FCC power to order him or to control rest of his program or to supervise the content of rest of his program?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1652.255,1659.655,"Well, our submission is that the power derives basically from the fact that these systems do use broadcast signals."
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.476,1707.199,"Well, I take it then a fortiori where you have a voluntary cablecaster and I suppose there are some."
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1719.349,1720.095,Not only would I say but --
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1720.095,1725.074,Assume they had 20 channels and they filled them all up.
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.038,1741.625,"You think you could reach the originating programs, the fairness of the originating programs, just because of the use of some broadcast signals?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1741.625,1744.97,That commission's rule does apply in that case.
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.846,1766.199,True but Commission's power and authority?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1766.199,1782.62,"Rather commission and if the fairness doctrine is to operate effectively or if the equal opportunities provision had to operate effectively but what is the commission to do, if the cablecasting is all going to feature people from one party."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.51,1804.623,"Assume the non-existent cablecaster, doesn't use broadcasting."
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1816.889,1824.901,The commission has not attempted to apply that far and that would present a much more difficult question.
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.822,1858.076,Do you think the Fortnightly Corporation decision has any relevance to the issues here?
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1858.076,1860.622,I think it has relevance in this respect.
1971.71-506,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.871,1865.547,Whether there was a violation of -- .
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1865.547,1879.129,"But it does indicate that -- it seems to me, it goes somewhat to the reasonableness of the commission's rule and I am obviously not going to have time to discuss that issue at any length."
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.646,1948.569,"Mr. Wallace that point is, we do have this demarcation of 3,500 subscribers."
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1949.147,1951.423,That is correct.
1971.71-506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.423,1956.443,"I suppose my question is, is there anything arbitrary about the 3,500 mark?"
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1956.443,1967.719,Well it was developed in the course of very lengthy considerations here that I rehearsed quite a bit in the appendix to the petition.
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.373,2093.042,"Mr. Wallace as I read Judge Gibson's concurring opinion at least, he doesn't -- he does not question FCC power in any broad sense, I noted in his opinion, he uses the phrase at this time at least to, perhaps three times in his opinion."
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2110.341,2123.3,"If I may say so, Your Honor, it reads to me like a dissenting opinion of the commissioner to this report in order rather than an opinion on review."
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2123.3,2125.615,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
1971.71-506,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2125.615,2126.753,Thank you sir.
1971.71-506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.753,2131.947,Mr. Plotkin.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2131.947,2136.768,"Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the court."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.073,2506.798,That's because they are carrying broadcast signals.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2506.798,2508.93,"They because they are carrying broadcast signals, that's right."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.93,2511.423,Even though that they are carrying it by wire.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2511.423,2523.035,"That's right, they are really preforming no different function in that respect than you do in your home, when you put an antenna on top of your roof, you have a wire coming down from the antenna into your set."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.792,2536.914,And did Southwestern approve the power commission to force the cable TVs to carry things they didn't want to?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2536.914,2539.007,No that wasn't even involved at that time.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.32,2544.99,What about the order to carry local stations?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2544.99,2546.661,To carry what?
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.661,2550.447,That the cable operators have to carry all local stations even though they didn't want to.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2550.447,2555.161,"Yes, that was what was involved there, the commission said as part of out authority."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.161,2557.97,"Well I know, but was that involved in Southwestern?"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2557.97,2560.592,The rule was involved in that case that wasn't challenged.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.592,2561.604,It was upheld --
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2561.604,2572.928,"Yeah that particular moment wasn't challenged but in another case, which Midwest had brought in the Eight Circuit where that rule was challenged, the Eight Circuit did uphold that regulation and so it was not solved."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.933,2584.215,"Do you challenge that as well, I mean if your position were sustained, would you say that commission couldn't force the cable TV people to carry all local station?"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2584.215,2590.404,That's the position we took several years ago and we were not able to persuade the courts that that was correct.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.654,2609.535,"But I just wonder all, Mr. Plotkin, I just wondered if your position -- if your position were sustained, would it also invalidate that rule?"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2609.535,2611.727,"No, in this case, not at all."
1971.71-506,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2641.864,2646.323,"(Inaudible) if any, with the state systems maybe they should?"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2646.323,2657.434,"Well the state's -- the commission, at this stage of the game is undertaking in many areas to pre-empt the theory of state regulation, the states are fighting that and that matter is now --"
1971.71-506,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2657.434,2658.541,Is that involved in this game?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2658.541,2665.482,"That is not, the State Illinois has filed a brief for amicus in this court which they assert that it is involved."
1971.71-506,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2693.64,2696.856,Does any state have regulations covering origination?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2696.856,2710.103,"Some municipalities, when you have to get a franchise from municipality to operate a CATV system because your wires cross over alleys and screeching, you have to get a franchise from it."
1971.71-506,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2717.035,2719.002,"Well, then what would --"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2719.002,2719.445,What?
1971.71-506,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2719.445,2722.807,They would fall under this regulation?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2722.807,2735.033,Not automatically because we think that what’s involved here is an absence of statutory authority with constitutional overtones but we don't think you have reached a reached the constitutional problem because there’s an absence of statutory authority.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.716,2866.898,Some of the mountainous areas out west can't get television without -- .
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2866.898,2868.631,"That's right, that's right."
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2962.314,2973.724,You say that the commission could never require that development -- it's now reaching for here.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2973.724,2978.808,"Under the statute that Congress had drafted, I say they do not have the statutory authority, that is correct."
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2978.808,2979.745,Under any circumstances.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2979.745,2982.32,Under any of the present statute.
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.32,2982.778,That's what I mean.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,2983.12,2984.724,Under present statute they are not.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.405,3202.314,"Let's assume there is a licensed TV station and the operator and the owner prefers to just to be a transmitter, to get a network 100%."
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3202.314,3203.016,Yes.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.016,3210.977,"And doesn't the commission have power to tell him he has to put on the air, certain amount of local program and originate some programs."
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3210.977,3220.062,"The commission says to him, that you can't operate a broadcast station without a license, and license requires you to operate in the public interest."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.125,3238.65,"Now, say to the cablecaster, if you want to use broadcast signals, you've to get a little piece of paper from us."
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3238.65,3239.081,Only to --
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.081,3240.541,That you call the license is it?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3240.541,3243.25,"Well, but the license that the --"
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.25,3245.476,He does anything -- they have to get permission?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3245.476,3247.574,They have to get permission from the commission.
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.574,3254.894,"The commission says to him, if you want to use these broadcast signals, you have got to carry for the houses, a certain balance of programs."
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3254.894,3256.625,"That's what they are saying, what we are saying."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.661,3258.433,What's the difference between the two situations?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3258.433,3266.258,"The difference between the two situations in effect they are saying is, that if you want to carry broadcast signals, you must become something additional to that."
1971.71-506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.083,3279.8,"I know, but in the example I gave you, a man says all I want to do is, all I need is some equipment and I just transmit it automatic."
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3287.08,3288.424,You want to answer that after lunch Mr. Plotkin?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3288.424,3294.962,Yes.
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.962,3295.701,Continue.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3295.701,3297.118,Thank you Your Honor.
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3297.118,3303.12,You have about ten minutes remaining of your time.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3303.12,3314.721,"The innovative question that Mr. Justice White asked and is really the novel case is, as to what is the nature of the undertaking of the commission's jurisdictions."
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.579,3475.021,"But isn't the commission saying here Mr. Plotkin that in order to perform and fulfill your total public function, you must do these additional things?"
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3475.021,3492.55,"What I am saying -- that's what they are trying to say, and I am not saying that it's an un-worthy thing that they are trying to do, but in effect they are telling us who only want to be -- to manufacture and install receivers or to install receivers since we are performing that function, we ought to do something else."
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3492.55,3501.556,"Well, you are doing a little more than installing receivers, you are operating a system, the last stage of which is installing."
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3501.556,3502.308,That's right.
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.028,3567.83,And in the public interest?
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3567.83,3572.794,"In the public interest related to the reception functions, and there is ancillary to the broadcast function."
1971.71-506,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3789.507,3795.837,I thought the basic question here was whether or not this order of the commission was within its statutory authority.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3795.837,3796.446,That's correct.
1971.71-506,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3796.446,3799.25,Not whether or not it was good or bad.
1971.71-506,1,27779,harry_m_plotkin,,3799.25,3800.159,That's right.
1971.71-506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3910.998,3917.282,"Thank you Mr. Plotkin, thank you Mr. Wallace."
