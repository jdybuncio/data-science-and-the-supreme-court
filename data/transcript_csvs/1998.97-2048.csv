1998.97-2048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.92,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-2048, William O'Sullivan v. Darren Boerckel."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,26.567,30.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.477,74.381,"Now, in Illinois, does the petitioner appear pro se?"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,77.25,79.952,"--In Mr. Boerckel's case, Mr. Boerckel had counsel."
1998.97-2048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.468,87.189,"Generally speaking, counsel would not be provided--"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,87.189,88.006,There's no--
1998.97-2048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,88.006,94.51,--for a prisoner who would be filing for discretionary review in the Illinois Supreme Court?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,94.51,96.812,--I have to give you a mixed response to that.
1998.97-2048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.843,122.445,And that would be true nationwide I suppose.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,122.445,123.145,I would assume.
1998.97-2048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.145,126.247,You would find a lot of places where there would not be counsel.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,126.247,127.031,I would assume.
1998.97-2048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.031,131.385,"Do you feel you can speak for the practice outside of Illinois, Mr. Browers?"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,131.951,132.368,To some extent.
1998.97-2048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,132.368,134.087,--Have you practiced other places?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,134.087,134.57,"No, I haven't."
1998.97-2048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.57,137.889,Is there some research that is available?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,137.889,142.192,"If it's available, I neglected to include that."
1998.97-2048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.964,161.004,"The Seventh Circuit opinion, as I read it, put great stress on the fact that the Supreme Court of Illinois did not wish to get involved in a lot of these things."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,187.637,189.521,"I beg to differ, Your Honor."
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,222.894,229.981,"I thought you were speaking across the board that as long as there is an avenue, even if it's discretionary."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,248.192,248.608,No.
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.5,268.17,"Well, let's stick in... with your own State and... and what is the picture with respect to State habeas?"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,283.08,286.449,"--No, he must not... he need not."
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.409,334.612,"May I ask, you couldn't get State habeas if you had let your appeal of right pass by, could you?"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,334.612,336.814,--It would be an irrelevancy under State law.
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.814,337.647,It would be--
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,337.647,345.217,"If you had a record claim, regardless of whether you did a petition for leave to appeal or not, it wouldn't be a claim that could be brought."
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,345.217,346.05,--Not a petition for leave to appeal.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,355.323,356.873,"No, you don't."
1998.97-2048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.441,357.825,You don't.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,357.825,363.012,"But you would be limited in what you... you're always limited in what you can raise on what we'll call State habeas, which is--"
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.012,368.547,"Well, I understood you to say that on State habeas, you couldn't raise anything that you could have raised in your direct appeal."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,368.547,369.082,--Exactly.
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.082,369.599,Okay.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,370.432,374.467,"They're completely unrelated, and the analogy to Federal habeas completely breaks down."
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.025,401.784,"Mr. Browers, I think I... I would not have difficulty in accepting your... your general proposition that if there is discretionary... that if there is an avenue of discretionary relief available under the State, a... a defendant must pursue it and exhaust."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,479.503,485.89,"Well, we would take issue with that... with the supposed signals that the Illinois Supreme Court gives."
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.898,506.971,"And they... I don't have a... the list is pretty much path-breaking kind of questions rather than the fact... case fact-specific questions, is it not?"
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,506.971,510.523,"The list may be, but it doesn't list... it does not limit their--"
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.523,511.006,You're quite right.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,519.779,520.828,--Assume it's that limited.
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.968,533.586,"Before you get into that, I don't want to assume that it's that limited."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,533.586,534.836,"--Well, I don't assume so--"
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.836,547.16,"We... we are indeed... I mean, we do try to take up here path-breaking cases, and... and have not been a court of errors for many years, or at least primarily a court of errors."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,561.153,561.737,"--Sure, they do."
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.622,573.878,"You see, I think we're tending to look at this from the standpoint of... of... we have a rule that is not... not very dissimilar from the Illinois Supreme Court's rule."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,573.878,574.663,--I understand.
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.663,578.365,"And the way we apply it, we... we don't purport to be a court of errors."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,582.084,587.97,"I don't think their jurisprudence is quite like this Court's, however much the rules may read the same."
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.339,592.374,"Well, you gave... let's see if we can get down to specifics."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,602.514,608.801,I gave those two or three examples because they raise the precise issues that Darren Boerckel failed to raise.
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.801,609.318,Yes.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,609.318,612.436,And I limited myself to the discretionary docket of that court.
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,618.692,622.228,"Well, tell me, you know... and your... your best good faith is okay with me."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,622.228,623.394,This is not atypical at all for that court.
1998.97-2048,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,623.394,625.68,It's... so that there are... there are lots of these cases.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,625.68,631.334,There's another aspect I can tell you... and I can only tell you in a sort of anecdotal sense.
1998.97-2048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.157,694.407,May I ask on that point?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,723.343,724.543,I'm not sure that's the case.
1998.97-2048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.58,735.651,"Well, surely if everybody has to file... go to the Supreme Court of Illinois, more... more people would go than if they don't have to file."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,736.917,742.555,--I'm not sure that the State's rules were designed looking toward Federal habeas.
1998.97-2048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.555,743.155,"No, no."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,743.757,747.459,They're giving evidence of relief within the State system to petitioners.
1998.97-2048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.731,758.85,But that almost makes the point even more clear.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,787.786,792.738,"--I'm not... I'm not sure the Illinois Supreme Court would object to that, and I'm not sure that it would lead to either."
1998.97-2048,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.748,842.837,Would you say that there... there's no evidence that the Illinois Supreme Court affirmatively discourages prisoners from seeking discretionary review?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,842.837,843.706,--I would say that.
1998.97-2048,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,858.631,860.748,I take it... I take it most attorneys prefer two bites at the apple.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,860.748,861.75,What?
1998.97-2048,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.75,865.035,I take it most attorneys prefer two bites at the apple.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,865.035,869.754,"I think so, and I think habeas petitioners... this one in particular is going for four."
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.497,886.782,"Mr. Browers, I'm curious."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,891.936,893.019,I am too.
1998.97-2048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.019,894.821,Do you have any explanation for that?
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,907.296,908.981,I don't either.
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.247,978.292,"To go back to Justice Kennedy's question for a minute, what in your view would make a difference if... suppose the State had quite clearly said, as South Carolina has said, they said in a... they published something called In re Exhaustion of State Remedies."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,995.187,997.289,"I think that's an irrelevancy, Your Honor."
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,997.289,997.822,All right.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,997.822,999.405,Exhaustion is a Federal question.
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,999.405,1004.226,"So, in other words, your view is that even if the State of Illinois were to say, we've thought about this matter."
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,1032.292,1038.696,"I understand the lure of that, and in fact, Boerckel relies on Arizona precedent doing precisely that."
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1042.184,1044.767,I understand it's a Federal question.
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,1078.44,1080.207,"Well, I mean, this is the reverse."
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.14,1081.723,That's a different--
1998.97-2048,0,43906,william_l_browers,,1081.723,1082.373,--the Federal courts what to do?
1998.97-2048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.373,1084.223,--I come to that after the first one.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1486.796,1491.013,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2048,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.289,1532.907,That's 3 percent of criminal cases.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1532.907,1533.557,--Correct.
1998.97-2048,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.557,1536.609,Do you know what the percentage is across the board?
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1536.609,1538.311,Granted?
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.487,1555.421,Excuse me.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1576.067,1577.602,That is certainly--
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.602,1589.66,"Now, might not some State supreme courts and, for all I know, the Illinois Supreme Court do a... do a quick look and if it... if it has no reason... at least no reason to think that there was an error, deny it, but if it has reason to think there was an error, grant it?"
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1591.862,1592.396,--On that--
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.396,1595.398,--we don't know what they're doing just because they have a discretionary system.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1595.398,1599.016,"--On that, there is an Illinois opinion."
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.292,1614.592,"Well, Virginia had the same rule."
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1636.325,1669.362,"If... I... I think that Illinois Supreme Court rule 315 tells us that... that the Illinois Supreme Court, like this Court, is trying to set itself up as a body to resolve broad questions, and as in this Court, if... if a claim amounted to nothing more than the right standard was applied but the result was wrong, there's no indication in Illinois Supreme Court... in Illinois Supreme Court rule 315 that the Illinois Supreme Court wants to hear that kind of a claim."
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.362,1670.662,Supervisory authority.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1675.6,1696.346,I think that what that... what that would cover is... is allowing... I think it has been applied in cases involving allowing misconduct and in some... but that... that is the most general provision--
1998.97-2048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.346,1707.285,"Yes, I know, and we... we have the same, and we use it, you know, rarely I will admit, but occasionally we take a case just because we think it was wrongly decided, if the injustice is outrageous enough."
1998.97-2048,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.285,1719.01,"It's fair to say, isn't it, that there's nothing either in the rule or in the written opinions of the court where the court has ever said that claims such as these should not be submitted to it?"
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1719.01,1720.962,--That... that's fair to say.
1998.97-2048,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1720.962,1734.535,What about... I thought you were going to get down to a comment specifically on sort of the number of error correction cases that in one way or another the Supreme Court of... of the State does entertain.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1742.841,1746.376,Numerically I have not looked at all the cases.
1998.97-2048,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.581,1806.798,Okay.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1849.241,1849.86,"--Yes, I do."
1998.97-2048,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.338,1890.235,"Mr. Mote, do you think that the answer to the questions posed in the petition here should depend, to any substantial degree, on the likelihood of success in a petition to the Illinois Supreme Court as opposed to a likelihood of success in some other State supreme court and where there's an intermediate court of appeals?"
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1890.235,1902.626,"No, I don't... I don't think this Court should adopt a rule where... where they look at it and try to determine the likelihood of... of success a particular petition would... would have."
1998.97-2048,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.283,1967.485,You say override the view of the Illinois Supreme Court.
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,1970.287,1972.806,--Yes.
1998.97-2048,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.206,2009.645,"Not every potential habeas litigant is going to have a garden variety case, you know, with 15 errors and you hope one of them is... is found... finds favor with the court."
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,2020.203,2031.694,"I've not contended for a specific rule in this case, but I see the Court as having two alternatives."
1998.97-2048,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.341,2068.516,"That... that is going to leave habeas courts trying to decide what factors that are concededly not dispositive mean, which strikes me as introducing a great deal of subjectivity among the 700 district judges in the country."
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,2068.516,2077.123,The Federal habeas courts are already required to look at what State law requires and they have some familiarity with that.
1998.97-2048,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.303,2113.498,"If... if we're talking about ease of administration, which may not be the final criterion, certainly as... as easy a rule to administer as any is to say if you could have applied to the Supreme Court of Illinois, you... you had to."
1998.97-2048,1,21200,david_b_mote,,2113.498,2115.498,That... that would be--
