1968.343,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.736,"Number 343, United States versus an Article of Drug."
1968.343,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,28.479,32.808,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.343,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,176.129,178.013,Where is that 507?
1968.343,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,178.013,187.611,507 may appears on page 3 of our brief; that is the batch-testing requirement for antibiotic drugs.
1968.343,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,203.207,207.928,"As I see 507, it talks about batches and drugs."
1968.343,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,207.928,210.641,That refers to production batches of --
1968.343,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,210.641,213.443,Where the certification of batches of drug.
1968.343,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,213.443,214.651,That is correct.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1696.197,1707.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1778.691,1780.84,What do you mean if there is no danger?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1780.84,1794.616,I mean that there is no danger and I mean that the extent of antibiotic of the basing of antibiotic therapy upon the disc test is far more limited than the Government would have us believe.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.666,1936.086,They have to be?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1936.086,1939.213,I think they have to be in order to be reversed.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.195,1943.488,All the findings with consist of --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1943.488,1947.414,"I'm talking about the finding, yes sir."
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.414,1949.744,These all factual?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1949.744,1959.716,"No sir, it is not all the factual question."
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1982.807,1983.791,As a part of what?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,1983.791,2001.815,"A part of a batch which is to be tested by the Government, the term “batch” to me Mr. Chief Justice set and it mean something with some homogenetic to it, and here we have a whole different, an entirely different sort of an article."
1968.343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.811,2010.658,The Government said each of those eight came from a “batch” envelop?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2010.658,2021.588,"Yes sir, they came from a batch which was manufactured by a company which manufactures antibiotics which are tested by the Government on Section 507."
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.374,2057.292,"But if the only market for the manufacturer of the antibiotics were the maker of this Unidisk, then as I understand that 507 would not require batch-testing?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2057.292,2058.922,If the only market was --
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.922,2061.559,"That's a complicated question, and perhaps I haven't thought."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2071.929,2072.904,That is correct.
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.904,2074.792,From another manufacturer.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2091.442,2091.536,"Well, the Government --"
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2091.536,2094.668,"The manufacturer of antibiotics, it sells only to the makers of discs."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2094.668,2100.0,"The Government said it would require it because they consider this a drug, and since the antibiotic --"
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2100.0,2102.906,"Well, no, no, as I understand, if they consider this a drug?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2102.906,2113.05,"Yes sir, but they also would consider the antibiotic going into it a drug because it would be a component of the drug under the statute."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.076,2122.446,I wonder if you answer him now.
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.446,2145.611,"Well, I think your answer make accepts you start it to say that you answer to another question, whether or not these had already been batch-tested before they were sold to the maker of the Unidisk and you said, well, you thought maybe or maybe not because probably a manufacturer would not differentiated his various antibiotics depending upon to whom he was going to sell them."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2145.611,2148.326,I can't conceive that he would.
1968.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.326,2149.866,"Well, what --"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2149.866,2153.29,I think they are check-tested by the Food and Drug Administration.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2153.29,2158.666,Can you tell me precisely what this thing does?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2158.666,2162.525,I can try Your Honor.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2167.411,2169.51,Sensitivity to a drug?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2169.51,2171.171,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2209.93,2210.326,What?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2210.326,2214.045,This is placed to this disc.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2233.077,2235.326,Can you put over divide it?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2235.326,2235.919,Sir?
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2235.919,2237.439,Why do you say this is put?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2237.439,2245.63,"It's put on an agar plate, glass or china plate in the laboratory."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2245.63,2248.917,"Well, what does it contact with reference to the human being?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2248.917,2249.761,It doesn't.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2257.88,2258.627,Let's take it from the --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2258.627,2260.97,-- of the human being; that is correct.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2262.948,2266.589,"Now, --"
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.589,2268.888,"Well, in layman's terms."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2271.489,2272.457,Yes.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.457,2275.081,"Apparently, it has some kind of infection in it."
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2284.434,2289.414,"Right, and so, they take the fluid whatever it is; they put it in the dish?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2289.414,2289.699,That is correct.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2289.699,2296.49,"Whatever you call a dish, they isolate from it whatever the particular infection in it?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2296.49,2298.461,"The first step is the isolation, --"
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2298.461,2298.541,Isolation?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2298.541,2300.168,-- I think some 18 hours.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2300.168,2303.451,And then you put this thing in the dish itself don't you this disc?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2303.451,2308.032,You strict the agar on the plate of dish -- with the islet.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2308.032,2310.583,"Don't strict me, will you?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2318.373,2322.209,I'm not sure we have never order that.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.209,2323.327,That's what I want to get straight.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2323.327,2329.382,"The agar goes on the disc, they isolate from the patient goes on the agar -- I mean, on the dish."
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2333.231,2333.653,What's the agar?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2333.653,2336.053,"It's a growing medium, to grow --"
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2336.053,2336.368,I see.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2336.368,2337.924,-- the bacteria --
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.924,2338.246,Right.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2338.246,2339.475,-- in the isolate.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.475,2339.941,Right.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2347.114,2348.092,Yes.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.092,2358.784,"And then there is some kind of attraction to the particular antibiotic which would be effective against this particular infection whatever it maybe, is that it?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2358.784,2364.33,If the infection or the infectious strain --
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.33,2365.103,Yes.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2365.103,2367.288,"-- is sensitive to the antibiotic, --"
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2367.288,2368.162,Right.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2368.162,2368.638,-- there will be --
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2368.638,2371.343,"Sensitive, meaning that the antibiotic might clear it up?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2371.343,2372.281,Might clear it up.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2372.281,2372.576,Right.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2372.576,2378.41,You don't know that it would because this is an in vitro-test and was transferred to the body it may act and how to do it.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2378.41,2384.528,"But nevertheless, this is then the tell whom of the laboratory technician or the doctor?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2394.361,2401.538,That is what the laboratory technician may tell the doctor.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2412.384,2414.151,"Right, and it may or may not work?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2414.151,2414.643,It may or may not.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.643,2419.379,But the point is this disc is out of a case after it has performed that function?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2419.379,2420.186,That is correct.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2420.186,2437.781,"All right, and as I understand it from what at least what Mr. Wallace suggested to us; the antibiotics used to impregnate these little things on this disc are not taken from batches which have been certified, is that right?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2437.781,2442.976,"Well, I would assume that they are from batches which have been tested by the Food and Drug Administration."
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2442.976,2446.143,"Well, I thought Mr. Wallace told us that's one of the problems here."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2446.143,2447.272,He did say that.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2447.272,2448.541,"Yes, but what's the record --"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2448.541,2449.927,I would assume differently.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2449.927,2450.815,"Well, what's the record show?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2450.815,2454.196,There's nothing in the record on that Your Honor.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.196,2456.881,"Well, what is Government want to test the antibiotics?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2456.881,2458.953,They want to test this disc.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.953,2469.895,So they want to -- they don't want just to test the batches of antibiotics that are used to impregnate this disc.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2473.628,2477.548,"That is correct, yes sir."
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2477.548,2490.641,"And that I take it with the idea, I think that's what Mr. Wallace said that except as whatever is that impregnate these discs have gone through the certification procedures."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2499.191,2500.726,That is the position.
1968.343,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2500.726,2517.495,"And at that then, may have a deleterious effect in consequence upon the patient who maybe treated by a result which because it's not been impregnated were certified batches might come up with the wrong answer or no answer."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2517.495,2518.96,That is the position of the Government.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.96,2527.204,But do they claimed that there's something else that needs testing besides the antibiotics that are used to impregnated these discs?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2527.204,2527.551,They claim --
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.551,2528.976,There's something else about disc --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2528.976,2530.254,-- should be tested.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.254,2541.803,I know but is there something that happens to the antibiotics because of contact with the disc which means that the discs themselves be impregnated this have to be tested?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2541.803,2543.078,The Government I think they should be tested --
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.078,2548.577,Or would they to be satisfied with having with testing the antibiotics used to impregnate the disc?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2548.577,2565.12,The Government thinks they should be -- the discs themselves should be tested because they have found that the public health in their mind will be endangered if they are not tested.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.333,2592.267,Have they been in circulation?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2592.267,2592.856,Sir?
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.856,2593.962,Have they been in circulation?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2593.962,2594.609,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.609,2596.254,Ever since the litigation --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2596.254,2596.641,Oh!
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.224,2601.342,That's a different question.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2601.342,2605.182,That -- I know but I'm going to -- if you permit me sir.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.839,2653.971,"Well, we suppose to second guess the agency on this kind of a judgment --"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2653.971,2654.73,"Sir, it is not --"
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.73,2660.007,"-- public health is in danger or not now, do you really suggest that we --"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2660.007,2668.49,"Well, Mr. Justice, they have made no -- this is not a finding made by the agency which is binding on the courts."
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.27,2716.244,"Well, what about diagnosis Mr. Williams?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2716.244,2721.683,"Well, diagnosis was practically abandoned by the Government in the lower court as a ground for its position."
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.123,2755.688,Did the agency make any -- as the agency at any time made any findings with respect to why this disc qualified either under the treatment or the diagnosis?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2755.688,2766.895,They made a legal conclusion in the proceeding which is been referred to when the -- in the course of which the regulations were adopted.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.275,2777.632,They didn't say whether it was because of the treatment or diagnosis?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2777.632,2779.249,I don't recall that they did.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2779.249,2780.574,Did they pass at all --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2780.574,2784.187,"But they have built in terms of diagnosis, excuse me sir."
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2784.187,2791.73,Did they pass it all of whether or not the device was -- the disc was a device?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2791.73,2797.744,"So far as I know, that was not considered by the agency, it didn't appear in the public proceeding."
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2797.744,2799.271,There's been no ruling on that?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2799.271,2800.449,No sir as far as I know.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.449,2808.622,I think the Government though all that concedes that the disc is also covered by the definition of device?
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2808.622,2811.776,The Government doesn't even mentioned device as I read this brief.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2811.776,2836.661,"Well, I think the Government's point was that the language of the device section and 201 (h) of its statute and the language of the disc of the drug Section 201 (g) of the statute are quite similar except in that 201 (g) excludes devices from a definition of drug."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2836.661,2838.605,Is subsiding being the drug?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2838.605,2840.202,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2840.202,2841.937,Antibiotic could go?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2841.937,2842.634,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2842.634,2847.612,"Well, in its advice you wouldn't have batch-testing if it was a device?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2847.612,2851.418,"No, you would not have batch-testing but you could have control as we point out --"
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2851.418,2852.125,Different kind?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2852.125,2853.72,-- in our brief of a different kind.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2853.72,2855.874,Misbranding or --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2855.874,2855.922,Yes.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2855.922,2856.998,-- possibly?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2856.998,2857.834,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2860.18,2870.161,"There is no -- that issue of device is not here, I don't find it in the Government's contentions or have I misread the brief?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2870.161,2873.494,It isn't before the Court in my opinion sir.
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2873.494,2875.211,Court below didn't pass on it.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2875.211,2888.495,"The court below said that if there was anything, it was probably a device because the only difference between a device and a drug is that a device is an apparatus or an instrument or a contragulants."
1968.343,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2888.495,2891.799,But the agency didn't rule that it was or was not a device?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2891.799,2896.068,"No, they rule it was a drug thereby excluding it from the definition of device."
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2896.068,2917.437,"Mr. Williams, suppose these discs were made so that it was to be applied to the human body or therapeutic purposes exactly the same disc not to be applied to the human body or therapeutic purposes, were that be any doubt that it was a drug?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2917.437,2919.275,"No sir, there would be no doubt it was drug."
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2919.275,2940.0,"Suppose, it were to be applied to the human body or diagnostic purposes, that is to say for the purpose let us say of finding out what sort of microorganism is causing the difficulty, is there any doubt that that would be a drug?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2940.0,2943.287,If it were applied to the human body for diagnostic purposes?
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2944.12,2949.769,So that the question here comes down to this as I understand it.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,2975.601,2991.428,"Yes sir, but I should like to stress Mr. Justice that treatment of a patient is the test of whether this is used in treatment and this there is no treatment of a patient by this device."
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3002.852,3003.675,"Well, in a sense it is viewed --"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3003.675,3005.593,Diagnosis is recognition of disease.
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3005.593,3006.125,Yes.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3026.778,3035.015,It is used very in a sense and to determine the antibiotic used in treatment on the certain circumstances.
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3035.015,3057.693,"May I ask you this sir if you happen to know the various substances, spanes and what not that are used in the laboratory for the purpose of -- for diagnostic purposes to determine what the microorganism is or what not."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3062.506,3063.791,No sir.
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3087.309,3092.946,"I suppose however, how about something like this if there is such thing."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3134.351,3139.275,I believe so under the statute Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3139.275,3141.116,You don't know of any case is?
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3153.989,3160.485,"Mr. Williams, I asked you a few moments ago if antibiotic is a drugs, you said yes."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3160.485,3161.007,Yes sir.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3161.007,3164.432,You said sulfur diagi drug.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3177.176,3180.734,I'll tell you why sir.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3197.552,3199.072,"Well, that drug is, isn't it?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3199.072,3200.357,This is not.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3200.357,3200.859,What?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3200.859,3201.11,No.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3201.11,3204.905,I'm talking about this disc come from what the drug is going to put on.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3204.905,3212.474,"Well, this drug could -- if this drug will use to wash a window, it certainly wouldn't be --"
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3212.474,3214.135,"Its still be a drug, wouldn't it?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3214.135,3215.474,"No sir, not under the statute."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3215.474,3216.318,Is it drug?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3216.318,3219.023,Not under the statute.
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3221.959,3225.547,"Well, did it used in diagnostic, diagnostic purposes?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3225.547,3234.859,"No sir, it is not because it does not identify the organism and without identification of the organism, there cannot be diagnosis."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3234.859,3249.055,"Do you know how much theory that when you do this, it does not give you a correct answer and you may give a man this drug on the false assumption that he does not sensitive to it."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3249.055,3269.304,"That is their contention and I obviously don't have time to go into my argument, but it is quite clear from the literature and from the trial that there are so many built-in protections against the sort of thing the Government apparently feared that this is simply not going to occur."
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3280.989,3286.696,"Whether it's a little or much, I would not go to around it at all what they say is case."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3286.696,3287.563,But what they say does --
1968.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3287.563,3288.989,Was involved here.
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3288.989,3292.031,"In my opinion, it isn't the case."
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3292.865,3295.871,"It was the opinion of Dr. Turin, wasn't it?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3295.871,3301.348,Yes and I asked Dr. Turin for some kind of specifics on that point.
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3302.938,3309.262,"Well, do we or should we wait until they know someone who has died from the use of this before?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3309.262,3311.688,"After 16 years Mr. Chief Justice, you would --"
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3311.688,3315.005,-- file a judgment for the Government?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3315.005,3323.225,After 16 years Mr. Chief Justice I should think that something would've occurred if that were going to.
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3323.225,3334.952,"Well, maybe you would think so, but the Government through its research might think differently and should we hazard to help for the public by saying this isn't necessary?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3334.952,3342.315,The Government through its research has come up with nothing.That's demonstrated in our brief.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.24,3358.084,Do you say that this disc is not a device either?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3358.084,3362.295,"I say that if it is anything, it's a device."
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.295,3367.179,Under the -- (Voice Overlap) does it have to be one or the other either a drug or a device?
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3367.179,3368.699,No sir.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.699,3371.45,But do you say it's neither or do you say its --
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3371.45,3374.713,"I say it's very realistically under the statute, is neither."
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.974,3388.084,"What to be a device under the statute, it has to be used for the diagnosis or treatment of a disease just like the drug."
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3388.084,3388.761,That is correct.
1968.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.153,3396.129,"But you said if used for that sort, it can't be either?"
1968.343,1,23367,edward_brown_williams,,3396.129,3401.946,"That's my position, yes sir."
1968.343,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3519.732,3523.166,"Very well, you have a minute or two Mr. Wallace."
1968.343,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3523.166,3524.361,Thank you.
1968.343,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3555.532,3557.695,(Inaudible)
1968.343,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3557.695,3577.998,"I don't believe I said in fact, but we have to assure that the proper amount is on each of these discs and that it will defuse properly for the test and that the labeling is correct on the disc that would not be accomplished by batch-testing of the powders themselves."
1968.343,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3577.998,3587.62,"I gather that the Government does not claim that whatever it was use to impregnate was not batch-tested, indeed they may well hold."
1968.343,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3587.62,3588.715,That maybe.
1968.343,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3588.715,3593.839,"But that the Government feels nevertheless these should be given other test, is that right?"
1968.343,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3593.839,3601.474,The discs themselves are drugs subject to the batch-testing requirement; that is correct.
1968.343,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3680.318,3682.828,Very well.
