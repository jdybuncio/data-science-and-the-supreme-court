1980.80-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.058,We will proceed to hear arguments in the related case of the Secretary v. Indiana.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,62.74,67.894,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.388,145.394,And it's your position that Congress under the Commerce Clause can freeze that classification?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,149.946,152.814,"That's not what the statute does, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.923,192.375,And to keep it that way for five years?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,192.375,199.795,There is the provision that there has to be revegetation and that revegetation has to exist for a period of five years.
1980.80-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,373.442,378.244,You mean that issue could be raised at a later point by another litigant.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,378.244,379.679,"--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.741,406.513,But that is interpreting a California statute where the California courts had held there was no such thing as inverse condemnation.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,412.483,421.839,"Well, the Tucker Act certainly does provide a monetary remedy for alleged violations of the Constitution."
1980.80-231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,471.189,473.256,"Well, let me see if I understand that, Mr. Buscemi."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,501.839,502.039,--That's right.
1980.80-231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.727,507.593,Is that true also in the other case?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,507.593,508.679,"--Yes, it is."
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.525,590.631,"Well, the statute requires a comparison with the same level of management as had heretofore been given."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,590.631,590.814,That's right.
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.997,599.237,"And if, in the past, that level had been a high level of management, then there's sense in what the district court said, isn't there?"
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,599.237,600.57,"That's certainly true, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.925,611.044,The equivalent level of management?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,611.044,611.794,--That's exactly right.
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.794,613.227,At the same level of management.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,613.227,614.329,All it's saying is that--
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,614.329,625.368,"But if the level anterior to the strip mining has been a high level of management, then one must compare what a high level of management would produce after the strip mining."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,625.618,625.784,--That's right.
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.438,634.74,With the same level of management?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,634.74,635.224,That's right.
1980.80-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.401,739.288,That goes to the taking argument and not to the Commerce Clause argument?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,739.288,740.288,"Yes, that's right."
1980.80-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.025,759.952,"I haven't read Mr. Conlon's letter in full, but when he states that the coal industry is quite capable, do you mean, is he saying it's physically possible or economically feasible or both?"
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,759.952,770.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, I thought he was saying both, and I could be corrected on that, but we did quote the sentence in his... on page 110 of the Appendix."
1980.80-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,770.807,772.859,"Yes, I have that before me."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,777.913,791.404,"Well, I think that the... you know, that letter is instructive for another reason as well, because if focuses on the debate that was in Congress with respect to the prime farmlands."
1980.80-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.429,836.202,"As to the specific illustration he's giving, it apparently... he regards it as economically feasible."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,841.337,845.391,"Well, but let me put it this way, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.7,897.007,"Mr. Buscemi, could you help me on your argument that the taking issue is raised prematurely and we'd be better off to wait till a specific case arose involving specific parcel."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,925.01,937.401,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I think that perhaps the word premature implies a timing element that's not the sole content of the argument."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.161,954.311,"Well, they're not, here."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,954.311,982.696,"--on the prime farms... I'm talking of the Virginia case... and if he's further investigated the possibility of restoring the land and he's concluded on the basis of all of that information that it is either impossible or impractical, and moreover he's concluded that there are no other beneficial uses of this land, then it may be appropriate for him to come and say that, well, my property has been taken."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.43,987.584,It seems to me all prospective operators would be in the same boat.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,991.369,995.321,"--Well, but I think the application of the statute may well vary from place to place."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.954,1001.824,"Well, the only variance I think of is where the postmining use might be, say, an airport, where you wouldn't want to farm on it."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1008.93,1019.703,"--Well, I think, Mr. Justice Stevens, that one of the critical inquiries that the Court engages in when it looks to see whether there has been a taking is to look at the other uses for the property."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.459,1034.981,But is it not true that by hypothesis every parcel we're talking about would be one that is being used for farming immediately before the mining occurred?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1034.981,1039.783,"--Well, at least that historically has had this intensive agricultural cultivation."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.52,1045.686,I see.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1045.686,1053.276,"Regardless of of what it's being used for at the time, there may be other beneficial uses that are available for that land."
1980.80-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.106,1093.151,"Following up on Justice Stevens' question, how do you treat a case such as Mahon v. Pennsylvania Coal Company, in which Justice Holmes' opinion says the regulation is unconstitutional because you've crossed the boundary between regulation and taking?"
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1105.661,1111.046,"Well, but, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that that's a very good example of the point that I'm trying to make."
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.636,1409.886,"It is direct, though."
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1412.021,1417.408,You have to pay the penalty only if you wish to seek review of the amount of penalty.
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.408,1419.86,This is the procedural due process issue?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1419.86,1420.377,That is correct.
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.377,1424.162,Is there any precedent for that particular procedure?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1424.162,1434.703,"Well, I don't know if there's precedent for the particular procedure of paying a civil penalty under, you know, one of these--"
1980.80-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.703,1435.386,Before you get here.
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1435.386,1438.405,--but there's certainly a deprivation of property before a hearing.
1980.80-231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.405,1441.357,Seizing property?
1980.80-231,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1441.357,1441.59,Yes.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,1650.741,1655.562,"Mr. Justice Powell, I will do that at the end."
1980.80-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.459,1869.601,"National League of Cities depended upon the fact that the subjects of the regulation were themselves states, did it not?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,1878.622,1889.93,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, far be it from me to say precisely what was said in there, but I think there were two things that were important to the Court in NLC."
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.386,2133.338,"Mr. Kelly, let me push you with a question on it."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2151.465,2165.29,"Well, I would certainly think that to the extent that nuclear waste had a potential for an interstate spillover effect, from one state to another, that this might be an area where the federal interest might indeed be permanent."
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.29,2172.879,"Well, supposing Congress found in the coal area that there's an interstate spillover?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2189.156,2203.232,"Well, I think even if there is a compelling national interest here, at least under the Fourteenth Amendment cases where you have a suspect class, there is still the next level of inquiry, and that is, is there a less intrusive means of doing this?"
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.806,2227.8,"In other words, your land use planning exception, or land use control, is something that the Federal Government can invade only when there is no less intrusive means of doing it?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2229.25,2232.418,"I think so, Mr. Justice; yes."
1980.80-231,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2412.152,2418.473,"Well, in past years there's been a good deal of surface mining in the State of Illinois."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2418.473,2419.973,"There certainly has, Your Honor."
1980.80-231,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2431.464,2434.316,"Well, of course, statistically that doesn't mean anything."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2437.101,2446.456,"I use that for the split, Your Honor, in terms of the fact that 50 percent of their present production is mined by underground coal, the underground method."
1980.80-231,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2451.027,2458.264,And I say those statistics don't really mean very much unless they're taken in the context of the total production in each state.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2460.133,2475.143,I think also attention needs to be focused upon Section 522 and the attempt by the Federal Government to force the states to zone land as unsuitable for surface mining.
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.435,2746.601,"Mr. Kelly, would you help me a little more on the taking issue?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2759.695,2763.647,--Only insofar as prohibiting mining in the Indiana case.
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.143,2795.118,"Does that apply to all of the surface mining, or just the certain parcels of land, or how widespread is this defect in the statute?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2795.118,2813.829,"Insofar as surface mining in Indiana is concerned, we have... and I think it's in Exhibit Three, Mr. Justice Stevens, sets forth the nature of the surface mineable reserves and the extent of the prime farmland."
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.733,2822.368,Is all the darkened part of that exhibit prime farmland?
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2822.368,2830.291,All of the dark green is 75 percent prime farmland and the yellow is 25 percent prime farmland.
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.291,2834.909,"In the balance of the state that's not shaded at all, is there no coal there?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2836.195,2836.678,There is no coal.
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.678,2837.228,There's no coal.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2837.228,2842.782,And I think that is something that's quite obvious in terms of the lack of the land use concept in Indiana.
1980.80-231,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2917.58,2937.41,"It may be as adequate as anybody can inform me today, but I really don't understand what opportunities property owners will have if they can prove later, assuming the Government wins, that they can prove that they have no beneficial interest left in their proper as a result of this Act."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2937.41,2939.928,I think that issue will--
1980.80-231,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2939.928,2944.214,Maybe the Solicitor General should address that in the few minutes remaining to him.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,2944.214,2956.974,"--I think I can only make one statement in that regard, and that is that most coal companies in Indiana own or lease only the coal."
1980.80-231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.48,3014.576,"And I suppose, if a plaintiff claims that his property has been taken by the government without compensation, and if the government is the Federal Government, as it is here, he can under the Tucker Act go into the Court of Claims and make that claim, and claim for compensation for the taking of his property, can't he, at any time?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3014.576,3017.278,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, if the Federal Government is doing it."
1980.80-231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.078,3019.38,"Well, that becomes an issue in the case."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3019.38,3020.197,--It could be.
1980.80-231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.349,3035.224,"Well, certainly, you have a constitutional right to be compensated for property that is taken from you by the Federal Government."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3035.224,3038.276,"Well, that's certainly true, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.276,3042.58,And I would think that it wouldn't take too ingenious a lawyer to file such a complaint.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3042.58,3043.78,"No, that's true."
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.809,3104.367,"I suppose if you presume the statute is constitutional, you shouldn't buy the land unless you think you can make some money mining it, bearing the cost of restoring it to its original condition."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3107.653,3119.644,"My only answer to that would be, Your Honor, if nine Members of this Court sometimes don't agree on what is a taking, how can our clients as businessmen really have--"
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.644,3124.03,"But you're complaining if, even if there's no taking, you say it should be unconstitutional, which is a little different argument than that--"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3124.03,3128.149,"--No, I don't think it ought to be unconstitutional, even if there's no taking, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.742,3150.932,"--Well, supposing that with respect to 90 percent of the mineable land in Indiana, it can be restored and maybe five or ten percent cannot be."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3156.336,3170.576,I guess that's... I guess I would state it at this point that the statute would be unconstitutional because the states at this point need to know that.
1980.80-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.576,3178.415,"Well, don't you have to... before you mine, you want to get, you have to have a permit to open up a bond."
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3181.784,0.0,"The technological capability, yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.736,0.0,--Yes.
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3204.4,3205.149,That's true.
1980.80-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.149,3210.469,"At least at that point you've been deprived of your mineral interest, you would say, I guess?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3210.469,3210.869,Right.
1980.80-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.069,3217.807,Have you done this with any particular piece of property?
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3217.807,3226.163,"Insofar as the property is concerned, at this point, our clients have not and in all probability that is due to the grandfather clause that is present."
1980.80-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.317,3236.269,"Well, you're doing the mining... so far you've been able to mine under the grandfather clause?"
1980.80-231,1,25594,g_daniel_kelly_jr,,3236.269,3253.98,"--That's true, and there's a lot of litigation over the extent and the meaning of the grandfather clause, so that there is some type of preexisting property right that is protected, but it's coming to a head very quickly."
1980.80-231,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3256.58,3267.954,"Mr. Buscemi, do you agree that the Tucker Act will be available to a private landowner who claims a taking?"
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3267.954,3276.493,"I certainly agree, Mr. Justice Powell, that a private landowner who claims a taking can bring a Tucker Act suit in the Court of Claims."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.335,3347.156,"Or he does his best to prove to the Government and the Government says, you've failed to prove it, no permit."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3347.156,3349.589,--Or he does his best and the Government says he failed.
1980.80-231,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3349.589,3362.249,"But in deciding this case, should we assume that there may be an opportunity to litigate in the event a private owner thinks his property has been taken?"
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3362.249,3391.166,"I think, Mr. Justice Powell, that you can certainly assume that one of two things available to a private owner, if he can establish that his property has been taken: you can assume either that there is a Court of Claims remedy under the Tucker Act for money damages, or that at least with respect to a particular piece of property, that there is a district court equitable remedy available in the form of an injunction under the statute as applied to that statute, and that's the problem that we encounter in this case."
1980.80-231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3391.166,3393.935,"Well, what happens in that case if he doesn't want an injunction, he wants damages?"
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3393.935,3403.243,"Well, I think that right now, at least, we're confronted with plaintiffs who would be very happy with an injunction."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.243,3405.426,Because then they can mine the coal?
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3405.426,3405.893,That's right.
1980.80-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.813,3422.569,"Do you concede that if there are, say, in 95 percent of the cases the statute works fine, but five percent of the cases they can prove they couldn't restore the land to the original condition."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3425.205,3426.055,Absolutely not.
1980.80-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3427.406,3429.306,"But... so you'd say, they don't have a remedy either?"
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3429.306,3436.428,"--Well, I would say that they would not win on the merits, but Mr. Justice Powell's question, I thought, was what do they do and how do they go about it."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.428,3443.649,"Why wouldn't they win on the merits, if they could prove that in five percent of the cases it would just be impossible to restore this land."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3451.088,3455.807,"Well, I think that that statement is correct under this Court's decisions."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.426,3458.409,And why wouldn't it be?
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3458.409,3464.396,"Well, because I think that part of Mr. Justice Powell's hypothetical was that no other beneficial use would be available."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.781,3468.966,"Well, then it can go on being used as farmland."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3468.966,3472.668,"--Well, under those circumstances I would think that the Court would not find a taking."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.668,3477.239,"Well, it makes their mineral interest unusable."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3477.239,3484.893,"Well, the New York Landmark statute made the thirty-foot house above Grand Central Station unusable too, but the Court sustained that."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.582,3511.81,"Well, I take it, then, you would say that if the Federal Government had just passed a law that said, there will be no more strip mining in Indiana... well, there will be no more strip mining under any prime farmlands no matter what, with just a flat prohibition, the land remains quite usable as prime farmland."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3513.578,3515.797,--I think that that would not be a taking; yes.
1980.80-231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3515.797,3520.265,Even if it's justifiable under the Commerce Clause?
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3520.265,3533.759,"The Commerce Clause question, as I say, I will give essentially the same answer that I gave you earlier, and that is that Congress would have to find that that was a reasonable measure under the Commerce Clause."
1980.80-231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3572.05,3576.585,But some of these coal companies don't own the farmland as farmland.
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3589.576,3593.796,"That's true, and that's the situation that was presented to the Court in Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon."
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.175,3614.043,And avoid an injunction issue if there were an adequate remedy at law?
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3614.043,3617.745,That would depend on the adequacy of the remedy at law.
1980.80-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.745,3619.281,"Well, compensation would be adequate, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3619.281,3621.181,In that event compensation would be adequate.
1980.80-231,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3636.056,3663.726,"Mr. Buscemi, in Virginia, in southwest Virginia where there are only steep hills but no farmland or very little farmland, the district judge in the Virginia case found that in many instances the land had no value whatever under the administration of this Act, so that could conceivably be different from land in another state where an individual or a company owned both the surface and the mineral rights."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3665.543,3666.512,That's correct.
1980.80-231,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3667.612,3673.416,In Virginia you could own a mountainside that had no utility in the world other than to strip mine.
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3673.416,3674.781,--That's correct.
1980.80-231,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3690.377,3693.245,"I've seen a few mountaintops taken off, but not many."
1980.80-231,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3693.245,3695.078,Thank you.
1980.80-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3695.078,3695.645,"Thank you, gentlemen."
