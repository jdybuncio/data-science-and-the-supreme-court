2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,"We will hear argument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United States."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,8.387,41.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This case is framed by two major facts: Jimmy Puckett pled guilty and waived his fundamental right to trial in exchange for a promise by the government that they agreed he was qualified for a three-level reduction in his offense level; and the government of the United States breached this promise."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.683,54.235,"Mr. Isaacson, you said there were two facts."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,68.042,71.244,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.881,80.868,"Well, I used to teach contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a breach of contract."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,161.404,177.08,"--The government in this case drafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements -- I've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite often, and virtually every plea agreement has a provision in it that says if the defendant does some type of criminal activity, thus it will render it void."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.532,180.282,Oh.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,180.282,182.401,So it's different than most plea agreements.
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.401,193.375,So you want to us make the inference that the impermissible or criminal activity was permitted by the absence of this specific clause.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,198.593,205.599,"Well, I'm not -- what we are saying is the government needs to obey the promise in the plea agreement."
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.149,217.991,"Well, the questions so far indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful behavior."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,233.416,240.606,"--It is -- well, it is up to the judge to determine whether or not the defendant gets the acceptance points or not."
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.026,252.164,And there is nothing theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you can feel remorse.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,259.834,264.304,"Yes, 3E1.1."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.314,285.099,But this judge said -- and he was open in his thinking.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,297.506,299.375,That is what Judge--
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.375,300.341,The judge did say that.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,320.939,322.891,--That is what Judge Sanders did say.
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,322.891,326.676,Your point is not that he should have gotten the reduction.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,330.128,331.83,"Well, the position--"
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.83,332.43,Isn't it?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,333.247,334.047,--Yes.
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.047,337.032,The agreement called for them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,340.603,347.356,The plea agreement did not say the government had to get up there and make a statement at sentencing that he was supposed to get his points.
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.805,375.24,"Where is that in the record, do you know offhand?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,377.692,391.785,"It's page 54a of the Joint Appendix volume 1, paragraphs 8 and 9."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.785,392.668,Thank you.
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.668,397.189,"I suppose Justice Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of prejudice."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,407.128,424.357,"Well -- I believe he has been prejudiced by the government's breach, because once the government violates the plea agreement on the first level, as we know under the prior precedents of this case, it makes the actual plea agreement void."
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,442.532,447.686,"Well, the judge would have known about what happened anyway from -- from the presentence investigation, wouldn't he?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,447.686,448.638,Correct.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.296,473.336,"But he could have, if he felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was taken, right?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,473.336,474.253,"I'm sorry, ma'am."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.753,476.121,When the plea was taken--
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,476.121,476.755,--Yes.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.755,478.671,"--it was the same judge, wasn't it?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,478.671,479.588,"Yes, Judge Sanders."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.588,491.598,"And so they were all there and the defendant was asked all these questions, and the government -- and the judge knew about the government's side of the plea bargain."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,491.598,492.165,"Right, yes."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.165,501.204,So it was not a secret to anyone that the government said it would ask for the extra acceptance of responsibility credit.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,520.582,525.217,Mr. Puckett had made a motion prior to the sentencing to withdraw his plea on his own.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.486,529.219,But--
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,529.219,529.604,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.604,536.025,--Before the judge there was no plea to withdraw the plea.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,536.025,537.625,"During the sentencing, no, there was not."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.625,546.63,"And so that's why we are -- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have a different case."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,550.267,555.719,Our point is that we suggest plain error shouldn't be applied to this case.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.242,565.777,But Santobello was a case where there was a timely objection.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,565.777,574.633,"That is correct, but the principles of whether or not when the government breaches a plea agreement that renders the underlying conviction void raises it to a different level."
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,574.633,575.767,Why should that be the case?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,607.521,610.723,I would suggest it goes to the very heart of whether or not he actually pled.
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,631.703,636.54,But you can say that in every case in which parties enter into a contract and later there is a breach.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,654.852,664.54,"--I would suggest this Court's precedent is that it has to be a knowing waiver of his rights, that promises that are unfulfilled or unfulfillable render the plea itself void."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.296,674.582,What relief are you seeking now?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,682.819,686.39,We request -- what relief do I want?
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.39,686.923,Right.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,686.923,691.358,Mr. Puckett would like the plea agreement to be set aside and be allowed to take this case to trial.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.358,695.829,Which would expose him to a considerably greater penalty.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,695.829,696.862,"Potentially, yes."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.862,718.342,Why wouldn't it suffice to give your client everything that he was entitled to if the case were remanded to a different judge and the government were required to go before that judge and make the commitment that it undertook in the plea agreement?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,718.342,719.061,We believe--
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.061,722.496,Why wouldn't that be a perfectly satisfactory remedy?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,722.496,729.55,"--We believe that the action of the government, again, rendered the plea agreement itself void, without value, and he would -- Mr. Puckett--"
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.55,731.602,"Well, you have to say that."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,758.069,762.288,--Certainly that is a remedy some circuits have used.
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.727,774.262,May I ask essentially two questions.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,811.287,815.775,I certainly can't put myself on the sides back then.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,823.262,827.063,"It did include it in the motion, didn't they?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,827.063,827.582,It was--
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.582,828.465,Wasn't there a motion--
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,828.465,828.965,--Yes.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.965,836.438,"--for credit for acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition that the defendant be law-abiding?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,836.438,841.14,"Yes, that was included in the motion filed the next day for the additional point, that is correct."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.14,855.0,"So isn't it odd that the -- that these documents both meant to serve the same purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct in the future and the other doesn't?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,855.0,863.839,"Well, one is a plea agreement that is entered in open court with the defendant present with his attorney and the second is a motion filed by the United States attorney the day after."
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.909,879.265,"But going back to my question, isn't it a likely explanation for the defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal provision in it?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,879.265,881.8,I -- I can't.
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.704,889.137,Right.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,889.137,895.56,"But I would suggest to you also that it was not included in this agreement, and since the government drafted it I don't think we can just assume it should be there."
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.56,896.677,"No, I understand that."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,908.534,921.192,"Well, if it is -- I think the language of -- of Brady -- certainly a plea must stand unless it is induced by misrepresentation, unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises."
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.531,939.57,"But those are cases that say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,939.57,946.843,"--Well, again, I am -- citing from Machibroda: A guilty plea, if induced by promises or threats which would deprive it of a private or voluntary act are void."
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.843,953.579,"Yes, but those -- that goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether or not the underlying contract became void, I think."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,955.015,960.502,"Well, I -- I think what we are saying is once the government takes its action, it deprives the plea of its voluntary character."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.502,965.804,It doesn't -- it doesn't retroactively render the government's promise a misrepresentation.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,982.749,997.008,"No, but I would suggest that Santobello again talks about the intent, whether or not -- in that case there were two prosecutors who didn't know what one -- the other one was doing, and this Court said that's not important; it is the integrity of the plea that's important and the government's breach thereof."
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.008,1005.781,Under the law of contracts I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't rescind for a nonmaterial breach.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1023.076,1024.46,Well--
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1024.46,1030.914,"So it seems to me an immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and correct me if I am wrong."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1039.185,1042.471,--I'm sorry -- I am missing -- what are you talking about?
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.471,1053.195,"There are some instances in which the -- the prosecution must make the recommendation before the district judge has the authority to depart downward, am I correct?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1053.195,1054.062,I -- I -- I am sorry.
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.785,1061.285,That's right.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1069.272,1071.306,"Well, the government filed a motion."
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.064,1089.035,"Even as to the third level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume that they have made the argument."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1102.278,1112.983,"Well, in terms of materiality of the breach, in Santobello there are those exact words: The government is in a very poor position to talk materiality after they've breached the agreement."
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1112.983,1118.621,"My reading of Santobello is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult for me to understand."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1118.621,1122.858,There was part of this agreement that was honored.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1141.653,1142.77,That's correct.
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.77,1162.166,"So if you say what you want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in this case that the judge ordered to be served concurrently rather than consecutively?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1162.166,1169.82,"Yes, there were three underlying Federal charges that he was on supervisory release for that the judge ran concurrently with the sentence in this case."
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1169.82,1177.326,What would counsel say about a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1231.228,1236.531,"I think there are two parts to your question, Your Honor, if I could address them."
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1290.099,1292.551,I'm not sure that really answers my question.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1292.551,1293.035,Well--
2008.07-9712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1293.035,1300.955,"Are you saying as to some errors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches there is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1300.955,1301.574,--No.
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.974,1353.507,"So you are saying, if -- if I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1365.231,1365.897,--Yes.
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.897,1369.468,"So no objection need to be made or can be made, right?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1369.468,1372.087,"Well, certainly, we -- we'd never suggest--"
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.087,1373.087,Wow.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1373.087,1381.359,"--Well, Your Honor, it -- it seems harsh and perhaps it is harsh, but the government has to abide by the contracts they make."
2008.07-9712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1381.359,1384.978,"Well, but I take it -- you never really answered Justice Alito's question."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1400.087,1403.606,"For it to be reversible, yes."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.606,1406.058,"Well, that's inconsistent with the answer you gave me."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1406.058,1406.841,I'm sorry.
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.841,1412.645,The answer you gave me is that automatically the guilty plea is washed out -- automatically.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1412.645,1419.132,"We -- if the government breaches the plea agreement, yes."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.132,1421.151,It is automatically washed out?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1421.151,1422.201,"Well, I would suggest--"
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.201,1426.388,"And, therefore, he cannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what happens."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1433.142,1437.029,"--I would suggest that the word ""void"" may also be ""voidable""."
2008.07-9712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.029,1439.645,Voidable -- then your answer to me would be different.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1452.372,1456.324,"Your Honor, these are not easy issues."
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.549,1478.821,"It would not be cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as much as you would have gotten anyway."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1482.356,1483.558,It's absolutely -- Mr. Puckett--
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1483.558,1484.524,"Well, but let's put it this way."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1504.222,1504.988,--It has been breached.
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1504.988,1508.674,"So in that situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1508.674,1511.792,I would suggest that it would be at the defendant's option to do so.
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.328,1514.794,Well--
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1514.794,1523.933,But why -- why should the defendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement when he got everything under the best possible circumstances that he could have expected?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1523.933,1528.337,"--Because the government -- well, we don't know that, what the sentence would have been by the sentencing judge."
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1528.337,1532.122,"No, but we are talking about the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1547.965,1554.571,Because the jurisprudence teaches that the result of the effect on the sentencing judge is simply irrelevant.
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1556.371,1586.007,"In other words, your position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong words here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as he could possibly have expected had the agreement been kept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the words he can walk away from the plea?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1587.292,1589.292,"--I believe so, yes."
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.17,1616.895,"Yes, but usually -- I mean, the theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief from something."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1646.162,1651.382,I -- I'm not suggesting it would be metaphysical.
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.318,1653.301,"Well, I think you are."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1666.809,1672.88,"--I think that suggests that the result on the judge has to do with the breach, what the government does."
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1681.219,1693.276,"What I'm getting at -- I think what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to have a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually look for a good reason to have that rule."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1718.011,1719.711,Because it doesn't occur.
2008.07-9712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1723.33,1725.53,Never mind what the government can cite.
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1731.251,1740.59,--There is an absolute -- the good reason is the defendant should get the promises the government has elicited for his giving up of his fundamental constitutional rights.
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.386,1759.004,May I ask this kind of conceptual question?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1765.491,1767.526,--Harmless error?
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1776.28,1779.917,"I'm trying to get rid of the labels like ""plain error"" and ""structural""."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1787.988,1789.107,"Yes, I believe so."
2008.07-9712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.107,1793.909,"So, there could never be harmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1793.909,1794.777,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.777,1827.398,"Why wouldn't someone read what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still sentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the sentences run concurrently, so I think -- why, if he doesn't try to withdraw the plea, why isn't it the logical assumption that he says I didn't get the whole promise but I got part of it, and I'll take it?"
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1827.398,1830.766,"Well, I think sometimes the defendant might well do that."
2008.07-9712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1831.816,1833.083,How do we know this one didn't?
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1833.083,1838.337,"--Well, by certainly the appeal that we raised."
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.11,1849.977,"--Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-9712,0,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,1851.613,1852.313,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-9712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.313,1855.898,Ms. Schertler.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1855.898,1869.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government breaches a plea agreement, an objection made in the district court serves important purposes that relate to the functioning of Federal courts."
2008.07-9712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.237,1952.962,"Just to explore the issue of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired and objected to in the district court."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1952.962,1953.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-9712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1953.978,1963.401,"The defense attorney says, well, now, if you look at paragraph 8 and so forth, and the government says, well, Your Honor, well, he committed another crime."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1981.279,1984.997,"Well, I think the result there is controlled by Santobello."
2008.07-9712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1984.997,1987.283,Is it?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1998.841,2001.776,I would -- I would -- I would seek to distinguish Santobello.
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2035.014,2040.151,"Excuse me, were you -- Justice Kennedy, were you through?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2114.199,2124.607,"Well, there -- certainly I agree, Justice Souter, that -- and although there is distinguishable facts in Santobello, that that theme is present in Santobello as well."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2190.616,2199.222,"I -- I think I would agree with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant has gotten everything the defendant bargained for."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2199.222,2200.105,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2200.105,2203.626,"It may have come by a more circuitous route, but he got it all."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2203.626,2204.226,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2204.226,2226.222,"But in the case when, unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the -- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars, neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal that he made?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2226.222,2232.026,I agree that is -- that is the strong suggestion of Santobello when there has been an objection made.
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2239.815,2254.224,"Doesn't -- whether we accept that proposition or not that the analysis must differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value we place on the importance of the proposition that I started with?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2294.534,2311.828,The high value that the Court placed on the liberty interest in that situation would also have to be to the exclusion of other very important interests that are served by making sure that objections are raised in the district court.
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2311.828,2313.763,"You are right, there is no question about it."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2331.575,2345.199,"I -- and -- but I also would add on to that that I don't think it is only efficiency, that that is the sole interest that would be sacrificed by an -- by an absolutist approach, really, that Your Honor has suggested."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2354.59,2356.24,Will you give me an example?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2356.24,2357.126,"--Yes, yes."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.507,2389.145,"No -- no question, but it seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an incentive that would never come into play if the government kept its word."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2389.145,2389.93,Well--
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2389.93,2394.399,So why -- why should -- why is the government really in a position to object to that?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2394.399,2408.059,"--Because this Court has the -- what it permits is manipulation of the system by -- by counsel, really."
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.059,2411.011,You're talking about manipulation of the system.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2420.032,2421.299,"Oh, we did acquiesce, yes."
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.568,2430.388,"And are you taking the position that -- that every case, that the absence of objection would always be controlling?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2430.388,2431.674,The--
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.674,2450.386,"For example, in this particular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you had an objection and if the judge had agreed with the objection and said I will set aside the plea because of adopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the government would have appealed, and said that that decision is so wrong and it's because it's really harmless error."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2458.824,2466.347,"--Well, but this -- this is the question on which the circuits had divided, and which is why we acquiesced in this case to sort through that question."
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.347,2473.334,"But in talking about the division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of -- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely the same standard?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2475.619,2502.353,"Well, I think that the analysis of a breach in each case will differ and it first and it will in the -- first and foremost depend upon what the standard of appellate review is and whether an objection has preserved, in which case it would be the government's burden to show that a breach is harmless, or in the plain-error sentencings the -- the burdens are reversed; and we think the -- the ordinary rules codified in rule 52(a) and (b) apply in this context equally."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.353,2508.424,"It's clear, isn't it, that the defendant in this case was in fact prejudiced?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2517.713,2519.096,So rare as to be unknown.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.096,2524.35,"--So rare -- I thought he said ""rare to unknown"", ""to be unknown"" -- you are right."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2524.35,2524.9,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.9,2530.338,But I suspect it's probably rarer still for the government to recommend that.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2542.895,2547.132,The -- let me respond to that immediate point.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.831,2574.2,"Yeah, but none of us can know what the judge would have done."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2588.042,2597.398,--And here under the plain error standard it was the defendant's burden to show a reasonable probability that something different would have happened.
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.671,2610.373,"Looking at this, why can't we say the following?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2692.908,2698.395,"Well, the -- the government has conceded, and I don't--"
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.395,2702.263,"Well, I mean, the government would like a whole lot of questions answered."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2728.164,2746.542,"--That is a possible outcome, Justice Breyer, and clarification for -- from this Court that the plain-error standard does apply to this type of error as it does to others would certainly help to resolve the conflict that does exist out there in the courts of appeal."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.542,2748.578,I may have gotten lost in the dialogue.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2757.599,2758.149,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.816,2760.199,So you are happy to go along that.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2760.199,2760.968,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.757,2772.276,"But that's a big difference, right?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2781.299,2782.565,"Well, yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.532,2821.424,"It seems to me that the government has tried to pick a case in which it has the strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in this case."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2821.424,2836.349,"--Well, Justice Stevens, what one finds when one looks through a lot of these -- when these cases are brought, there often is a dispute and a real -- and a genuine dispute as to whether a breach has occurred or not."
2008.07-9712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.122,2851.443,"But don't you think it would have been open to the government to make the argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant breach that should be ignored?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2851.443,2860.382,"As we acknowledge in our brief, there might be arguments out there that there were implicit terms to this plea agreement that were breached by the defendant."
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.369,2874.742,They can only get -- they can only get your breach if they find an implicit agreement.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2959.413,2969.686,"--Well, I mean -- as I've -- as I've already indicated, having the Court state that the -- Rule 52(b) applies here is a -- is a -- I think, a helpful--"
2008.07-9712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.686,2970.219,I think it's plain.
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.938,2975.523,"You fulfilled paragraph 9, didn't you?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2975.523,2985.113,--The -- paragraph 9 indicates that the government agrees to request that Puckett's sentence placed at the lowest end of the guideline levels deemed applicable by the court.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.359,3007.728,I think it's very clear that there has been a breach here.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3020.988,3035.498,"Well, I -- I guess that it's a matter of some disagreement, but -- I mean, we have -- we have taken the position that this was a breach of the government's agreement that he qualified for a three-level reduction in his offense level."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3035.898,3036.981,And you can put that before the judge.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3048.221,3060.696,"--Well, we breached the agreement by not doing what we said we would do, and the question we would submit to the Court is whether, given the absence of an objection, Petitioner carried his burden of showing that we did prejudice him."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.429,3067.783,"No, but isn't it the fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would have done if the government had what it said it would do."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3074.039,3094.25,"--Because in the plain-error setting, this Court has made clear that the burdens shift and that, under the third component of that standard, it is the defendant's burden, if he did not object, to show an effect on the outcome of the proceeding, that his substantial rights were violated."
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.808,3115.7,"Can you say just for me, because I am changing a little bit here in light of that question, but what is it precisely that the government said it would do that it did not do?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3115.7,3123.436,The -- paragraph 8 of the plea agreement indicates that the government--
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3123.436,3124.221,What does it say?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3126.905,3134.911,"--Well, we indicated to the district court that Petitioner did not qualify for acceptance of responsibility."
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.415,3141.348,So he did agree.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3151.206,3151.823,That's correct.
2008.07-9712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.677,3194.45,"As a matter of practice among U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at stake here, right?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3224.921,3237.479,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and if there had been an objection based on that provision of the plea agreement, that may have been very well what would have happened."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.571,3254.023,"Well, could the breach have been cured?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3326.219,3336.475,"Well, there would be more than one way to cure a breach such as this, if an objection had been raised in the district court."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3343.081,3344.281,Which would have been silly.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3344.281,3349.402,"--But if the defendant -- and if the defendant said that, that would be a silly way to correct it."
2008.07-9712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3358.341,3362.31,"It was sent to another judge, that judge would still have the presentence report."
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3390.729,3392.345,The probation officer said that.
2008.07-9712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3392.345,3392.779,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3392.779,3393.279,Yes.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.2,3435.758,"Maybe Judge Sanders would look at this kind of the way that we have been discussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's -- it's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you recommend that I depart?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3451.767,3461.389,"Well -- and again, I guess I would give the same response, that it -- it is Petitioner's burden to show a likelihood, a reasonable likelihood that it would have been different."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3461.389,3464.241,"With respect, that is not what Olano says, is it?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3473.966,3475.016,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2008.07-9712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3475.016,3483.322,And one way that you could show a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a demonstration that the outcome would have been different.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3513.591,3515.293,"It could, Justice Souter."
2008.07-9712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3525.316,3528.183,I know you want to -- as I point out one other thing to you.
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3568.427,3576.164,"--It was not correct, as a matter of fact, and the defense attorney made that correction, and the -- and the judge accepted that."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.2,3579.652,He wasn't -- was he convicted of this new crime?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3579.652,3585.104,--He -- not at the time of these proceedings.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3585.104,3585.722,"It was just an allegation, right?"
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3585.722,3586.222,That's right.
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3595.912,3597.78,Why did we assume anything anyway?
2008.07-9712,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3599.88,3606.034,"--He admitted the allegations to the probation officer, and that is what was reflected in the presentence report."
2008.07-9712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3656.1,3657.068,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-9712,2,34630,lars_r_isaacson,,3659.854,3666.924,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-9712,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3761.385,3762.42,"Thank you, counsel."
