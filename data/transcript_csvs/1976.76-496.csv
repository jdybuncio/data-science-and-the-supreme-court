1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2253.419,2283.56,"Mr. Chief Justice and the members of the court, I believe I would like to start by commenting that perhaps one of the saddest things with respect to this case is the possibility that if the true character of this Legislation would be obliterated by either a failure on our part to properly explain how it works or on the basis of assumed abuses in administration or assumed illegal applications."
1976.76-496,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.269,2457.454,"I think you ran over, by the Stewart point, take that map home with him?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2457.454,2459.46,"May it please the Court, certainly."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.46,2460.541,He takes the map home?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2460.541,2462.696,There is absolutely no reason in the world why he wouldn't take the map home.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.696,2463.355,Is that the..?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2463.355,2464.489,"Well, surely."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.489,2467.178,One of the wall maps.
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2467.178,2469.385,Justice Marshall I am not talking about a wall map.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.385,2470.677,"Well, that's what I am talking about."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2470.677,2473.748,That's why I am suggesting to the Court that the maps.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.748,2475.143,Is that the map we are talking about?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2475.143,2476.402,"No, I am not talking to Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.402,2479.504,Then what is the map we are talking about in the record?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2479.504,2496.308,"The record, Mr. Justice Marshall has a stipulation of the materials that were lent under the prior program and then it says that with respect to this new program, the materials are limited in two respects, over the prior program."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.318,2507.734,"Well, that it says that specifically that he takes the wall map home?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2507.734,2512.126,Mr. Justice Marshall I don't believe the wall maps are lent to pupils under this program.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.669,2514.953,Is that in the record?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2514.953,2517.239,It's not in the record one way or the Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.239,2523.067,"Well, it was in' wall maps were included before, weren't they?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2523.067,2527.073,"There's absolutely no question because under the prior program, we lent to the school."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2527.073,2532.006,Is that anything in the record that says that wall maps are not included now?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2532.006,2538.667,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the record points out that they must, the only thing that can be lent now, is that which is lendable to a pupil for individual use."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.667,2541.897,"My question, yes or no."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2548.188,2552.207,"Yes, I have to say Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say yes, but it depend on you how would you interpret it."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.47,2555.206,"When you say yes, I am going to ask you where in the record?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2555.206,2565.165,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I would suggest to you that it is in the record where it is indicated that the only materials are lent under this program are materials lent to pupils and can be used by pupils."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2565.165,2569.421,"Did you bring this lawsuit, or did the appellants bring it?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2569.421,2571.837,"Mr. Justice Burger, the appellants brought the lawsuit."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2571.837,2579.204,"So, but, whatever may be the state of the record with reference to that proof, is responsibility of the appellants, is it not?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2579.204,2582.065,"I would submit to the Court that, that is the case."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.065,2586.464,"Well, are you ready to back up anything and say here now?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2586.464,2588.687,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I wouldn;t say it, if I weren't."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.687,2596.165,"Well, where is it in the record, you said that wall maps are no longer taken home?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2596.165,2596.757,Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.757,2598.322,Did you say that?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2598.322,2599.135,Yes.
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.135,2601.332,"Well, where in the record is that stated."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2601.332,2610.805,"Mr. Justice Marshall, what I tried to point out is that what we have is a list of things that were used when they were lent to the schools under the old program."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.08,2633.795,"Without taking any more of your time, I do not imagine this case is on which side --"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2633.795,2636.983,"May it please the Court, I hope so, I feel very comfortable if that is the case."
1976.76-496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.221,2792.991,"Mr. Young, in your point about no direct contact between the school board and the religious institution and the loan being to the child, is it not correct that all the paper work and processing and the contact is between the school and the school board, they handle these loans on a collective basis and there is no direct contact with the pupil and the school board."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2792.991,2798.653,"Mr. Justice Stevens, that is partially correct, there is less contact than there would be in text book case."
1976.76-496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.653,2800.983,"It is not in the text books, it is there in the statute."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2800.983,2815.234,"Mr. Justice Stevens, in the text book case, it has been approved by this Court, both in Allen and in Meek, there was collective summaries prepared by the religious schools and they pass these summaries on to the public schools so that occurred in both Allen and in Meek."
1976.76-496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.064,2882.777,"Where does the child get it, from his own school or at the inventories of these equipment kit."
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2882.777,2888.129,"The statute permits of two different situations, depending on how close the public school is."
1976.76-496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.084,2942.817,Ths is the same thing true with the speed reading or the reading improvement equipment.
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,2942.817,2945.068,"Very definitely, Your Honor, the same thing is true."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.793,3008.668,"Mr. Young, is this material actually delivered to the school and not to the child?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,3010.497,3012.203,"Justice Marshall, it would initially ?"
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.203,3014.524,Is it not what the statute says?
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,3014.524,3023.35,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it would delivered either to the non public school or the public school and then the child must go to the clerk library and check it out and check it back in."
1976.76-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.35,3026.977,"So, it's given to the private school?"
1976.76-496,2,21724,david_j_young,,3026.977,3032.68,"Mr. Justice Marshall, very definitely not, it would be given to a public clerk librarian ?"
1976.76-496,3,31228,joshua_j_kancelbaum,,3506.312,3516.11,"Thank Your Honor, it appears to me that adverse counsel, has proved too much with that map example."
