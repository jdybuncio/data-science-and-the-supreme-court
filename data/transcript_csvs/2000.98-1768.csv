2000.98-1768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.454,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-1768, the Buckman Company v. the Plaintiffs' Legal Committee."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,10.486,15.111,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,110.341,135.938,"Do they really have to get into all of those issues, because I thought at least one theory of the plaintiffs' case was simply representation as determined on an objective basis and the only thing the jury would have to decide was whether, on an objective basis, the representation that the devices were intended for, what was it, long bone surgery, something other than spinal surgery, was true or false?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,137.628,142.913,"Justice Souter, they would have to do that because there's a fraud claim and if you look at the complaint--"
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.913,146.833,"Well, that would be a question of intent on the part of the company, but it--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,146.833,148.319,--It would--
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,148.319,149.434,"--I'm sorry, go ahead."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,149.434,151.457,"--It would be more than that, Justice Souter."
2000.98-1768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.148,203.304,"Mr. Geller, why wouldn't it be adequate to show that, that there had been two prior applications that were rejected for use of this device for spinal surgery?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,203.304,219.734,"Your Honor, the... what the manufacturer has to show in seeking 510(k) is, in addition to showing that the device has the physical technological characteristics of the predicate device the manufacturer also has to put down what the intended use of the device is."
2000.98-1768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.926,270.964,But my point was simply that we do have two applications that said the intended use is for spinal surgery and both of those applications were turned down.
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,276.62,278.683,"Well, I think the opposite, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.543,309.769,So you're saying in effect that there would be an issue of whether the FDA was complicit in the deception itself?
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,309.769,317.487,"--Absolutely, what did the FDA actually know about the use of these devices, and that's in our view not an inquiry that should be made under State law."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,318.314,350.886,"We know... I mean, as Justice Ginsburg's question suggests it would be fairly easy to prove what the FDA knew about possible applications, but I think, if I understand your answer to her, your answer is, well, that still doesn't simplify the case, because the issue then would become, even on that assumption, did the FDA understand perfectly well that this fraud was nothing but a fraud, and they winked at it and said, sure, this is an easy way of letting them do what they want to do even though we've said before that we won't let them do it."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,352.865,362.691,"--In effect, although whether it was even a fraud at all... you see, I think one of the problems here is in viewing the intended use statement under 510(k) as a factual representation at all."
2000.98-1768,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.958,392.784,"--It's really a misnomer, then, if you're going to use it the way you say they have been and ought to use it, they shouldn't call it intended use."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,398.235,398.557,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.601,519.844,"Mr. Geller, I'm sorry, may I ask you just to go back one step, and that is to the issue of whether the plaintiffs' cause of action really is an attack, at least on its face, on an FDA decision, because the FDA decision, as I understand it, is a decision to allow the devices to be marketed for the long bone use, and their cause of action, as I understand it, is that in fact, as a result of this lie, this fraud on the FDA, it was, in fact, allowed to be used, or it was possible to use it, I guess is the neutral word, on the spine."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,519.844,520.381,Yes.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,520.381,531.361,"But that is not attacking a decision of the FDA because, in the sense that the FDA, as I understand it, says yeah, we'll permit it for the purposes of long bone use."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,531.361,532.065,"No, I think--"
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.065,534.499,"And that's as far as the FDA decision went, wasn't it?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,534.499,535.985,--That's a mis... I think that's a misunderstanding--
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.985,536.44,Okay.
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,536.44,537.061,"--Justice Souter, of the process."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.332,555.759,"Oh, it's true, and the surgeons are not liable to the FDA--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,555.759,556.13,--That's--
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,556.13,562.446,--but is it fair to characterize the FDA decision as being a decision to permit it's use for the spine--
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,562.446,563.272,--The FDA.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,563.272,565.707,--as opposed to permit its use for the intended purpose?
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,565.707,570.62,"--The FDA decided that these devices were entitled to be on the market, labeled for long bone use."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,575.921,585.276,"And labeled for long bone use means, doesn't it, that the... or implies, doesn't it, that the FDA's approval was for long bone use--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,585.276,585.698,Yes.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.698,587.421,--and only for long bone use?
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,587.421,587.71,No.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.741,596.998,"It may not have had a right to go after the doctor who used it for some other purpose, but the extent of the FDA approval didn't go beyond long bones, did it?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,596.998,597.658,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.247,611.754,"Well, to the extent that it's used for more than long bones, hasn't the FDA in effect washed its hands of it?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,611.754,615.098,--But it is not inconsistent in any way with the FDA's decision.
2000.98-1768,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.431,646.76,"Mr. Geller, is it... explain to us, if you would, the practice of the FDA with regard to authorized drugs and devices."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,653.058,654.34,--Yes.
2000.98-1768,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,654.34,655.166,--by the FDA?
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,655.166,655.538,Yes.
2000.98-1768,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.076,657.767,"In fact, it's rather common?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,657.767,659.253,--Absolutely.
2000.98-1768,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.565,673.177,"For instance, the use of, what is it, the cholesterol reducing drugs for memory enhancement and that sort of thing is perfectly okay, even though it's authorized only for the cholesterol?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,673.177,673.549,--Absolutely.
2000.98-1768,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.991,698.844,"Now, I assume these plaintiffs would have a cause of action against the physicians who made the judgment that it's okay to use them for the spine?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,698.844,699.504,--If that failed--
2000.98-1768,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.504,701.09,"If, indeed, they're not safe for the spine?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,701.09,702.644,--If that fails to satisfy some State law duty of care.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.653,751.935,"No, I think... I mean, I think I--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,751.935,752.511,--Okay.
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,752.511,753.171,--get your point.
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,776.66,777.298,It is consistent--
2000.98-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,777.298,779.715,--That characterization might have an effect on the way we view--
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,779.715,786.336,"--My view, Your Honor, it... what happened here was perfectly consistent with the FDA... with the scheme and the FDA's decision here."
2000.98-1768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.886,842.247,"--And the marketing, you can't market it for use B.--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,842.247,843.261,--You cannot market it.
2000.98-1768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.261,845.036,--That's part of which statute?
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,845.036,846.772,That's part of the food and drug laws.
2000.98-1768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.525,863.695,"If it helps bring you to the argument on implied preemption, which I'm anxious to hear--"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,863.695,864.066,Yes.
2000.98-1768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.066,866.462,--let me just ask you this question.
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,893.705,894.448,No.
2000.98-1768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,894.902,895.895,Or there is implied preemption--
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,895.895,896.638,--Our position--
2000.98-1768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.638,898.124,"--and if so, why should that be?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,898.124,918.436,"--I think it should be, Justice Kennedy, because Congress ultimately made a decision that there is not to be a private right of action for violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that all violations of the act or suspected violations are to be enforced by the Food & Drug Administration in its ultimate discretion."
2000.98-1768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.619,966.667,"Mr. Geller, suppose the case was one in which the FDA decided that the misrepresentation, assuming there was one, was sufficient to justify taking it off the market."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,972.389,974.923,"Well, obviously it's not this case, but--"
2000.98-1768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.923,975.772,"No, I understand that."
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,975.772,983.285,--I would say no because of the Congress' decision not to provide... you cannot bring a cause of action that enforces the Federal Food & Drug laws.
2000.98-1768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.969,989.025,"Even though the Federal agency might have found there was, in fact, exactly the violation?"
2000.98-1768,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,989.025,1000.664,"--Absolutely, because there's too great a danger I think, Justice Stevens, that a State court might impose a remedy that is completely inconsistent with the remedy that the FDA itself would have decided was appropriate in that situation."
2000.98-1768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.616,1053.663,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1055.709,1067.764,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.98-1768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.297,1137.609,And would you give the same answer Mr. Geller did?
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1147.557,1154.783,"--The people who were... there would not be an injury for the fraud, but there would be whatever other claims--"
2000.98-1768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.783,1155.692,"You mean, there would not be a remedy for the fraud?"
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1155.692,1160.81,--For the... there would not be private damage actions for the fraud on the FDA.
2000.98-1768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.81,1168.052,"So the category of people who might exist... I'm not suggesting that's this case, but who might have been injured by that fraud would have absolutely no remedy?"
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1168.052,1174.268,The only remedies they would have are the other remedies that State laws affords if the product was--
2000.98-1768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.268,1175.467,But I... they're preempted.
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1175.467,1177.529,"--Well, let me just continue."
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.903,1201.201,What happens if the--
2000.98-1768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.201,1203.247,--What's the Federal provision on fraud on the FDA?
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1203.868,1213.528,"331(q)(2) is the prohibition against fraud, 21 U.S.C. 331 (q)(2), which I don't think is included in any of the materials here."
2000.98-1768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.528,1213.899,That's--
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1213.899,1225.045,"And the exclusive enforcement is 21 U.S.C. 337(a), which with certain limited exceptions gives the Federal Government exclusive authority to enforce the act's prohibitions."
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1225.045,1256.957,"--What would happen if an expert gave fraudulent or negligent, two different hypotheticals, information to an attorney, and the attorney then made a submission to the court, and the court makes a ruling, and the ruling is against the adversary party, can the adversary party then sue the expert just under State law, and does this happen all the time, or would the courts have in... throughout the States the same argument that you're making here, oh, we don't want a lot of satellite litigation, we don't want to be deluged?"
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1260.05,1274.251,"I'm not aware of cases, but we think the same general principle, if a court is defrauded and its judgment permits certain conduct, then the method to go about getting relief from that is to go back to the court and say that that judgment has been secured by fraud, and the same thing is true here."
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1274.251,1276.48,--This theory hasn't been tried?
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1276.48,1279.33,"I have not seen that theory tried, Justice Kennedy."
2000.98-1768,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1292.084,1293.737,The what?
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1293.737,1336.423,"--The FDA's decision clearing the devices at issue for marketing, and the reason that it does is that an essential element of this claim is that the devices never should have come to market under Federal law, whereas the FDA has determined that they should, and the fact that there is an allegation here that that decision was secured through fraud does not avert the conflict, because the FDA can reconsider its decisions and withdraw them if it determines they've been secured by fraud, but unless and until it does that, those decisions remain binding and authoritative, and they preempt any conflicting State law claims."
2000.98-1768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.423,1336.589,But you're going further.
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1340.593,1345.051,"Yes, Justice Stevens, but that's under my first argument and not under my second argument."
2000.98-1768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.051,1354.422,"Well, you'd say there would be preemption up to the point when the FDA reviews the matter and concludes that it has been defrauded."
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1370.769,1374.568,"You probably do, Justice Scalia, and there may not be a perfect analogy here, because--"
2000.98-1768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.568,1379.414,"Because you don't think there would be a private lawsuit, even after the FDA came to the conclusion that indeed--"
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1379.414,1394.069,"--That's correct, because the second theory of preemption would be gone, but our first theory of preemption, which is that this is a matter of exclusive Federal control over the decision as to whether there's fraud and what the remedies for that should be, would still be in effect."
2000.98-1768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1394.069,1396.587,--In other words... I'm sorry.
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1402.82,1403.357,It can.
2000.98-1768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1403.357,1405.215,"I mean, those are the reasons."
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1405.215,1405.958,That's correct.
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.448,1411.986,Excuse me.
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1415.701,1416.239,--No.
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.816,1418.013,Under--
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1418.013,1419.749,--There would still be a--
2000.98-1768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1419.749,1421.357,--Under the implied preemption theory.
2000.98-1768,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1421.357,1443.814,"--On the second implied preemption that I've given, which is that an outstanding Federal clearance decision, there would not be preemption, but... because that would have been withdrawn, but on the first theory preemption I'm giving, which is that the decision about whether there is fraud and what the remedies for that should be, there would still be preemption of that claim."
2000.98-1768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.237,1516.837,"Very well, Mr. Gornstein."
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1521.09,1526.253,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.98-1768,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.8,1619.254,May I just--
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.254,1623.712,--But that's an extraordinary... this is an extraordinary application of that principle.
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1623.712,1628.542,"--I don't believe so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I say that for this reason."
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.985,1650.811,From whom?
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1650.811,1651.183,That is true--
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.183,1652.092,From whom?
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1652.092,1658.863,"--You're entitled to recover damages from the maker of the misrepresentation, because that is where the culpable conduct lies."
2000.98-1768,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.869,1687.925,"It is, but in ordinary tort law the third party who has been defrauded does not have the power to say authoritatively in any sense, I have not been defrauded."
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1700.845,1711.581,"I agree with that statement, Justice Scalia, and I think that one of the important distinctions here is that this agency never said one way or the other whether they had been defrauded."
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.879,1724.434,If the FDA--
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1724.434,1725.26,--I would agree with you.
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.26,1732.507,"--If... supposing the FDA had opened the matter up, said we find we weren't defrauded, would you then have no claim?"
2000.98-1768,2,35805,michael_d_fishbein,,1732.507,1735.868,I think that that presents a more difficult question to--
2000.98-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.868,1739.073,"Well, I'm asking you to fish or cut bait, so to speak."
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3320.312,3322.707,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.98-1768,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.333,3431.191,"Mr. Geller, I don't understand one thing about your case."
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3431.191,3431.729,Yes.
2000.98-1768,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3431.729,3440.274,"I don't want to eat up your time, but do you contend that your client must... that a bona fide intended use is at least an intended use that you intend to market?"
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3440.728,3441.1,No.
2000.98-1768,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3441.1,3441.926,--What is bona fide--
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3441.926,3443.041,"No, there's absolutely no requirement."
2000.98-1768,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.041,3443.784,--You don't even have to intend to market it?
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3443.784,3444.155,You do not have to--
2000.98-1768,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.155,3445.847,"What does bona fide mean, then?"
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3445.847,3448.409,"--It's not our... it's not our word, it's the plaintiff's word."
2000.98-1768,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3460.23,3471.936,"Then why do we have a fraud cause of action, as opposed to a cause... on the part of the agency, as opposed to a cause of action for failing to abide by the terms of your regulatory applications?"
2000.98-1768,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3471.936,3474.454,"--Well, Justice... if I may answer the question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.98-1768,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.051,3491.544,Thank you.
