1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.848,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-50, Ellis P. Gregory and Anthony P. Nugent v. John D. Ashcroft."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,46.723,50.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.749,127.977,"The district court... the court of appeals accepted the district court's finding that the judges were not elected officials in Missouri, did it not?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,127.977,140.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Eighth Circuit accepted that proposition, but I must say in fairness there was a sentence which indicated if that issue had been briefed in the Eighth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit might have disagreed with that finding."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.325,140.693,Come out differently.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,140.693,148.099,"But the district court did find that the appointed judges were not elected to office, they are appointed to office."
1990.90-50,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.331,162.958,Why... why do you suppose Congress would have wanted to exclude from the ADEA elected judges but not appointed judges?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,162.958,180.63,"--Because I don't believe that Congress wanted to be looking over the shoulder of the voters to determine the motive or [inaudible] intention of the elected... the voters as to what motives they may have had in voting for elected officials, whether those elected officials were judges or Governors or legislators."
1990.90-50,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.63,186.944,"Well, now, Missouri selects its judges pursuant to constitutional provisions in the State of Missouri?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,186.944,189.235,The... that is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.235,190.795,State constitutional provisions.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,190.795,191.736,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor, but--"
1990.90-50,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.736,203.615,And you think it's sufficiently clear that Congress intended to override these State constitutional provisions without ever making clear that intent?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,203.615,213.342,--I think it is clear that the Congress intended that the ADA be construed broadly and that the exceptions be narrowly construed.
1990.90-50,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.927,262.072,"Well, don't you think that when we are dealing here with a preemption of a State constitutional provision of this significance to the State, that we should look for a clear expression of intent by Congress, not something that just appears never to have even been considered?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,262.072,279.035,"I believe, Justice O'Connor, there has been such clear intent or expression by the Congress, because when the act was amended in 1974 it was amended to specifically apply to States and political subdivisions as employers."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.735,314.508,"I thought Justice O'Connor's question was addressed not to whether the State was covered as an employer, which it obviously is under, certainly we upheld that in EEOC against Wyoming, but whether the statute, in view of the proviso, should be found to reach State court judges."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,314.508,319.041,"I believe, Your Honor, that it should be read to reach State court judges."
1990.90-50,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,383.343,387.877,"Why is that distinction made, do you think, Mr. Shoemake?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,387.877,403.537,"The... the language when the Missouri Plan was adopted initially applied to only the supreme court and the appellate judges, and the purpose was to remove partisan politics from the selection of judges."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.93,472.683,"Well, in order to have another term he has to get the votes, doesn't he?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,472.683,475.924,"He has to get the votes, or he has to be voted out of office."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.625,481.109,"I know, but he is out of office if... I mean, his term is over."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,481.109,483.069,"His term and over, and--"
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.069,485.43,How does he manage to get another term?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,485.43,490.673,"--If, if he's not voted to be retained, you mean, Your Honor?"
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.673,492.286,"Well, how does he get another term?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,494.115,494.536,He's on the ballot.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.651,503.793,"--So in effect the voters who vote to retain him say yes, he should have another term."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,503.793,504.494,That is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.065,505.814,Why isn't he elected?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,505.814,513.688,"--The reason he is not elected is the foundation for the Missouri Plan is that... first of all, he's not elected when he gets his office."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.37,514.859,That's right.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,514.859,519.413,A merit selection commission appoints... submits three names to the Governor.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.402,521.424,But the Governor can't give him another term.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,521.424,523.885,"No, the Governor cannot give him another term."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.885,525.137,The electorate has to give him another term.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,525.137,533.892,"But the process, we submit, as we have in our briefs, of retention or nonretention is like a question on the ballot, and not like one for--"
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.892,535.333,"Well, anyway, that issue isn't here, I guess."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,535.333,540.097,"--We submit that issue is not here, although the State has argued that."
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,540.097,546.302,"Mr. Shoemake, are all three of the judges involved here, have they been retained or has any of them been appointed?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,546.302,546.723,One has--
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.723,550.262,One has just been appointed and not stood for retention yet.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,550.262,550.933,"--Oh, these judges?"
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.805,553.224,They all have?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,556.777,557.628,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.628,559.899,But the issue would clearly apply to them in any event?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,559.899,560.78,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.153,647.226,I was intrigued by that theory.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,669.862,671.181,I... that's--
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.181,677.285,"--They have to be not only appointed by the elected official, but they have to be subject to his direction and command."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,677.285,679.008,--They have to be serving that officer.
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.388,682.229,"Now why, why would they make that kind of a distinction?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,683.39,699.191,"--Well, because they wanted that elected official to be able to have those persons who were going to serve him and generate the policy that he stands for, or attempt to, for which he was elected, to be able to serve him and be exempt from the act."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.581,810.582,"Well, Mr. Shoemake, you said a moment ago that it covers... the exemption exempts elected officials and then it goes on to say any person chosen by such officer to be on such officer's personal staff, and then it goes on to say or an appointee on the policy-making level."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,817.198,822.981,"Well, what I said on the elected official's staff, if I limited it to that I misspoke, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.679,857.195,"But you do agree that the phrase ""appointee on the policy-making level"" is independent of the phrase"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,861.847,866.659,"It's disjunctive, so I think it would be independent of that phrase, yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.11,902.934,"Well, I know, but I suppose... is there still a common law element in Missouri, isn't there?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,902.934,904.336,"--Yes, there is, Justice White."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.336,909.338,Judges keep developing the common law in Missouri?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,909.338,912.651,They do keep developing the common law in Missouri.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.651,917.272,"And they have to, they have to decide what the rule is to decide a case?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,917.272,918.944,They do.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.944,922.865,And you think that is... that isn't making any kind of policy?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,922.865,925.577,"I don't mean to suggest that, Justice White."
1990.90-50,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,951.396,956.339,"Well, I assume the Governor of the State of Missouri has to obey the State constitution and the common law, too, doesn't he?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,956.339,957.491,That is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.491,964.112,No official is completely unrestrained from certain minimal rudiments of discretion.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,964.112,965.744,I don't mean to suggest he is.
1990.90-50,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.495,968.957,"Well, then I don't see how your distinction is persuasive."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,968.957,985.087,"--Well, the distinction is the judges in Missouri don't make policy, for example, that... the policy will be that we're only going to allow public service companies to come for rate increases every 3 years."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.92,990.971,So you would say that... I suppose you have administrative agencies in the State?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,990.971,991.501,We do.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.501,994.915,And they are authorized by the legislature to issue regulations--
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,994.915,995.866,Rules and regulations.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.866,996.895,--implementing the statute?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,996.895,997.696,That is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.696,999.188,And those people are appointed?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,999.188,1000.506,Those people are appointed.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.506,1006.651,Therefore unprotected by the AD... by the Age Discrimination Act?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1006.651,1013.566,"It would be our view that those who are the head of those agencies, such as the Public Service Commission who may generate policy, could well be unprotected."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.566,1015.658,"Well, they're members of the agency that issue the regulations."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1015.658,1023.212,"If their appointments are for a number of years, 3 years, 4, then I would have to say yes, that they are unprotected."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.212,1027.866,Although the judges who review their issuance of the regulations are not?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1027.866,1028.867,Those judges who are appointed.
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.568,1035.69,"Yes, but Mr. Shoemake, it doesn't say or an appointee who is a policy maker."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1039.583,1040.644,That is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.644,1048.669,"Does that not mean comparable responsibility or comparable salary or something of that kind, rather than that the person must be a policy maker himself or herself?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1048.669,1055.525,"Well, the plain language of what Congress meant, as we read it, is they meant on the policy-making level."
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.525,1056.083,Right.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1056.083,1056.553,And--
1990.90-50,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.553,1069.082,"For example in salary way judges are paid at executive lever... level 2, 3, or 4, I don't know what it is, but they often have defined judges by the level of... for certain purposes is what I'm trying to say."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1072.746,1074.576,--I think that is the critical word.
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.963,1139.749,"Did Missouri at one time have an exemption from tort liability for charitable institutions, charities?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1139.749,1140.45,"Yes, it did."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.45,1141.228,And it... does it still have it?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1141.228,1145.202,"It does not... under certain circumstances it does, but generally it does not."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.202,1147.283,Was that result changed by the Supreme Court of Missouri?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1147.283,1147.793,It was.
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.494,1150.434,You wouldn't think that was policy making?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1150.434,1160.793,"--I think that would be... the tougher question of whether that's policy making, I'd have to say it is, but within the context of a matter of a dispute that comes before it."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.277,1199.25,"So... well, you would say that if an administrative agency in your State is authorized to issue regulations interpreting a statute and to... and to adjudicate cases based on that regulation, those regulators are not protected, as you said a minute ago?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1199.25,1201.211,That would say that those who are appointed--
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.211,1208.406,"Well, what if they, what if the agency decides well, regulations are fine but we're going to operate by adjudication."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1217.72,1218.621,--Um-hum.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.621,1223.726,I suppose you would say that those regulators are protected or unprotected?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1223.726,1228.218,"I would have to say in my mind, in my example, they're still unprotected."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.218,1229.09,Unprotected?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1229.09,1229.538,Unprotected.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.538,1230.078,Because they--
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1230.078,1231.621,Because they make that judgment.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.925,1247.439,"--But common law, the... when they announced the rule in the case they were announcing one that they were going to apply in all future cases."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1247.439,1248.551,That is correct.
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.807,1349.488,"Well, maybe the people who vote for other officials have a better knowledge of whether they are doing a good or bad job, and maybe it's a lot harder for the voter to know whether a judge is doing a good or bad job because it depends upon interpretation of a lot of dusty old statutes."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1360.725,1365.57,I would not... that was never an articulated rational basis for Missouri--
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.57,1366.381,Does it have to be an articulated one?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1366.381,1370.781,"--I would... I don't think we can guess, Justice Scalia, as to what the rational--"
1990.90-50,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.781,1371.493,"Oh, I think we have guessed all the time."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1371.493,1376.816,"--as to what... well, Missouri has articulated in the supreme court case as to what the rational bases were."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.515,1414.49,"But now, are those circuit judges, do you contend they are covered by the ADEA?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1414.49,1415.802,"No, I do not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.381,1437.696,"Yeah, but how about your response to Justice Scalia's question with respect to the judges who would be covered by the ADEA, and so... the appellate judges in Missouri?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1437.696,1438.257,--Well--
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.257,1440.697,Are those elections hotly contested?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1440.697,1443.569,"--It seems to me... no, they're not contested at all."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.395,1459.851,"Yes, but there may be terrific campaigns going to, on both sides of the issue, should this fellow be or this lady be retained or not."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1459.851,1461.113,There are those--
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.113,1464.062,There may be a lot of money spent on both sides of the case.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1464.062,1467.465,"--As existed in California, I recognize those cases."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.139,1475.88,"Haven't there been some votes, some numbers of votes against retention on certain people?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1475.88,1478.214,--There have been substantial votes.
1990.90-50,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1491.861,1492.652,Is that in the record?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1492.652,1493.892,--I beg your pardon?
1990.90-50,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.892,1494.823,Is that in the record?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1494.823,1497.515,"That is not in the record, Justice Marshall."
1990.90-50,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.515,1499.755,"It's public information though, I think."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1499.755,1501.117,It's public in... I probably should have.
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.942,1556.736,"Well, isn't there something to be said, though, for public office, high public office turning over every so often?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1565.561,1569.321,"With the circuit judges it's a 6-year election in Missouri, for those who are elected."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.068,1579.299,How about the appellate judges?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1579.299,1580.992,"--8 and 12, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.053,1604.485,"Well, except they are, they have shorter terms, certainly, than the appellate judges."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1604.485,1606.138,Shorter terms than the appellate judges.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.11,1618.675,"Well, would you say that, would you say the Age Discrimination Act is unconstitutional in exempting elected officials?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1618.675,1620.096,--No.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.087,1627.361,"Well, couldn't you argue there is no rational basis for exempting them?"
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1627.361,1629.913,"Well, I don't think so, because I think that--"
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.913,1631.112,"Well, you just did."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1631.112,1634.274,--I don't recall doing it.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.274,1639.948,"Well, you... you said there is no rational basis for not protecting these elected judges."
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1639.948,1642.632,"Under the equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, yes."
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.632,1643.44,Yes.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1643.44,1648.864,"The ADA is a specific... you mean is it, would I argue it's unconstitutional for the, that the ADA exempted elected officials?"
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.864,1649.716,Yeah.
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1649.716,1650.487,I would not argue that.
1990.90-50,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.487,1652.116,Not even as applied to judges?
1990.90-50,0,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,1652.116,1652.767,I would not.
1990.90-50,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.688,1656.69,"Thank you, Mr. Shoemake."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,1658.03,1661.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.086,1927.256,xxx normally call them law makers.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,1927.256,1937.254,"--That was one of the terms that were ascribed to them, and I think that the understanding that should be made if in fact the Congress had the... any knowledge--"
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.254,1939.364,"You would describe them as making the common law, wouldn't you?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,1939.364,1939.805,--Certainly.
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.848,1945.34,You don't find it under some rock?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,1945.34,1947.721,"--Well, we sometimes wonder, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.401,2045.946,"Mr. Deutsch, you know, we have to make the best we can of the language that Congress wrote for us."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2056.063,2056.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.982,2061.955,And then any person chosen by such officer to be on such officer's personal staff.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2064.369,2066.719,There are four separate exemptions.
1990.90-50,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.719,2069.67,Or an appointee on the policy level.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2071.913,2078.016,"Well, it... from the way that the statute was formed, it clearly was by itself."
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.911,2085.043,"Well, not if it's disjunctive."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2085.043,2103.886,"--It is disjunctive, and that was one of the things pointed out by the First Circuit in EEOC v. Massachusetts, is that it's perhaps not the most easily understood statute to be read, but clearly the House added that last provision, really the third exemption, in a conference."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.674,2152.329,Just refresh my recollection.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2157.02,2161.465,The Missouri Plan judges are appointees of the Governor according to the Missouri Plan.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.465,2163.195,--Who is an elected official.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2163.195,2164.687,He is an elected official.
1990.90-50,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.121,2226.067,"In the last clause of the first sentence of the statute, do you interpret the phrase"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2233.581,2236.863,I think that that was the intention.
1990.90-50,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.37,2268.154,"Your interpretation would be more sustainable if there was a comma after the word ""level"", I take it?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2268.154,2272.516,"I again will apologize for the lack of clarity of the statute, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2272.516,2289.137,"Well, sometimes the elimination of a comma is designed to aid us in the construction, and in this case it would indicate that the final clause applies and modifies both appointee and advisor."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2289.137,2291.967,That is an available reading.
1990.90-50,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.305,2321.457,We should try not to err at all.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2324.529,2325.931,"I know you do, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2401.54,2405.964,"The problem is the word ""elected to office""."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2411.838,2420.343,"That's correct, and that was... in a short footnote, the disposition made of it by the U.S. district court was that these are not elected to office."
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.744,2464.671,"But the... but even these judges who are appointed initially, their terms expire and in order to have a subsequent term they have to be voted on."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2464.671,2465.342,That's correct.
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.933,2503.478,Why would it... why would the State... why would your State have an occasion to decide that question?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2503.478,2508.019,We had a request for an attorney general's opinion back in 1973.
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.019,2508.43,Why?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2508.43,2509.601,Pardon me?
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.601,2510.3,Why?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2511.642,2519.306,Because the... our constitution prohibits a member of the general assembly from succeeding to an appointed--
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.306,2519.897,--I see.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2519.897,2522.068,"--office for which he raised the emoluments, and that occurred."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.615,2640.125,"May I ask you a question about the policy-making point, going back to the earlier argument?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2640.125,2640.465,Certainly.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.465,2648.313,I understand your argument about changing sovereign immunity and major changes in the law that are worked by the supreme court of the State.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2661.82,2667.954,I think any criminal defendant that has ever stood in front of one of our trial judges for sentencing probably regards him as a policy maker.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.858,2692.261,"Well supposing... I don't know, maybe you don't have something like our sentencing guidelines in the Federal system."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2702.586,2708.801,"--Well, of course they participate in the policy-making judgments for the judicial branch through their budget, and so forth."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.214,2734.159,What is the lowest level of jurisdiction that the judges covered in this category have?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2735.278,2736.139,--Associate circuit judge.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.69,2739.321,Associate circuit.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2742.333,2746.326,"They have, I believe it's a $15,000 dollar limit."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.326,2747.796,Do they have criminal court jurisdiction?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2747.796,2748.758,They have criminal court jurisdiction.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.87,2754.241,Felony?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2755.152,2764.376,"--Yes... well, particularly because in our State depending upon the circuit and its caseload the presiding judge may appoint an associate circuit judge to sit as a circuit judge."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.899,2783.53,And it is a full time job for them?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2783.53,2784.091,It certainly is.
1990.90-50,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2787.373,2793.447,"Mr. Deutsch, with respect to the associate circuit judges, they have $15,000 civil jurisdiction?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2793.915,2794.737,I believe that's the number.
1990.90-50,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2795.918,2801.912,"Well, within that jurisdiction they could be asked to recognize a new common law cause of action, couldn't they?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2801.912,2802.373,"Oh, certainly."
1990.90-50,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.523,2807.626,"And if requested they would have the option to do so, subject to appeal, wouldn't they?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2807.626,2808.087,--That's correct.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.836,2919.989,"On that argument I guess you could justify a 50-year retirement age, couldn't you?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2919.989,2921.829,--I think we probably could.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.882,2925.263,35?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2925.744,2926.505,Most of the judges--
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.505,2928.074,--You could justify a 35-year retirement.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2928.074,2929.056,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.056,2930.215,Why not?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2931.256,2933.899,"Well, that might be a little too fast."
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.481,2937.761,"Well, you certainly could say that judges could only serve one term."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2937.761,2944.326,--We have... term limitation is one of the fears that we have that come out of this case if the petitioners are agreed to.
1990.90-50,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.8,2958.614,"But you could say judges, whether they are elected or appointed, can only serve one term."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2958.614,2965.12,"--We could... we could do that constitutionally, and I don't think that the ADEA would certainly prohibit it."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.97,2971.023,Because that would not be discrimination on account of age.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2971.023,2973.315,--I would hope not.
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.315,2975.886,Right.
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,2975.886,2999.981,"To conclude with what I was saying before, the main feature that I think that comes out of the Missouri Plan, at least in the last 20 years since the mandatory retirement age has been in effect, is the fact that we have done a very good job, I think, of being able to promote more women, more minorities, into the judiciary, a place where it was lacking in the past."
1990.90-50,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.31,3016.773,"If your 70-year-old age limit causes this turnover, you've had that a long time."
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,3018.706,3025.71,"--I believe that perhaps some of the predecessors were not trying hard enough, Your Honor."
1990.90-50,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.71,3037.656,"Mr. Deutsch, was the... do you know whether the ADEA was based exclusively on the Commerce Clause, or was it also based on the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,3037.656,3048.766,"Well, the only thing that jumps out at me is that in the statement of purposes it says that a finding that the age discrimination in employment is a burden on interstate commerce."
1990.90-50,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.87,3124.344,Can we decide this case in your favor without saying that the Missouri Plan is great?
1990.90-50,1,30093,james_b_deutsch,,3126.374,3134.502,"--I would prefer, of course, that you say that, Your Honor, but I think we would accept that conclusion without those precise terms."
1990.90-50,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.894,3139.194,"Thank you, Mr. Deutsch."
1990.90-50,2,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,3142.817,3143.856,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-50,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.617,3177.97,"How is that significant in determining what Congress meant, though?"
1990.90-50,2,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,3177.97,3188.655,--I think it's significant in that... it's not... it goes to the issue of whether or not these appointed judges are elective and hence exempt from the coverage under the ADEA.
1990.90-50,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3188.655,3195.149,"I mean, it shows they don't fall into sort of one paradigm for the selection of people to run for office, but that's as far as it goes."
1990.90-50,2,32840,jim_j_shoemake,,3195.149,3206.617,"Well, Justice Souter, I submit it goes a little farther in that it shows that those who have... how they're dressed as elected officials, these appointed judges do not wear that clothing."
