1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.801,"We will hear arguments first this morning in number 74-1151 and 1419, Planned Parenthood against Danforth, and Danforth against Planned Parenthood."
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,20.208,23.361,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,648.492,660.192,"What is the traditional, the traditional obligation of the physician with respect to a patient independent of abortion is just patience?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,660.192,660.557,The obligation --
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,660.557,678.313,"Under his obligation with respect to the measures he must take, even if he thinks the patient maybe, probably dead, but possibly may have life that can be preserved."
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,682.063,690.299,"I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to normal patients or fetus’ surviving birth."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.571,693.441,"No, I am talking about people?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,693.441,693.807,I believe the --
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,693.807,712.137,"A man, a man rundown by an automobile and the physician happens to come and all of the vital signs appear to be negative, but he sees some that might indicate the possibility of survival, what is his obligation?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,712.137,717.287,"Legally, I do not -- if we are trying to -- I do not think we are getting into the Good Samaritan type of a problem."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,717.287,719.612,"The Doctor, Doctor is not just a Good Samaritan?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,719.612,720.433,I think he has an obligation --
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,720.433,721.598,(Voice Overlap) first --
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,721.598,738.896,"Under the normal Manslaughter-type Statutes, to use the ordinary means to preserve life, I do not believe that he has the obligation and most religious groups would agree that there is no obligation to use extraordinary methods of continuing heartbeat or respiration."
1975.74-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.132,813.974,"Well, would you have any objection to a simple requirement that the consent be informed, freely given and so forth, if it were not required to be in writing?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,813.974,820.782,"If the requirement were to single out abortion from all the hundreds and thousands of other medical and surgical procedures, I would."
1975.74-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.541,829.342,I thought you have said this was the general standard by which consent was judged for any sort of an operation?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,829.342,837.722,"I believe it is, but if abortion again is to be singled out for -- at the risk of criminal peril, I do not think it can be sustained."
1975.74-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.475,860.809,"Well, what if the legislature had determined or had some basis for deciding that in a particular type of operation there was more reason to question the consents that were given than in another type, would it not be permitted to address that problem?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,860.809,869.402,"I believe it would, but I do not believe that this particular statute addresses that problem because it does not in any way define what constitutes informed."
1975.74-1151,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.905,898.299,And why is this invalid?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,898.299,906.875,This particular -- because patient consent clause we believe is invalid; number one because it applies to all trimesters contrary to the Court’s decision in Roe.
1975.74-1151,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.516,909.756,But the court did not deal with this in Roe?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,909.756,918.985,"It did not deal specifically with the consents, but we believe that the Court stated that there was to be no regulation during the first trimester."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.41,934.822,"But would you include in that no-regulation language you are referring to, that the State could not require a medical report to be filed with the health department?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,934.822,937.594,Yes we would and that is part of it.
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.594,941.458,The State cannot demand a report?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,941.458,948.387,"If abortion is being singled out, the reporting and record keeping considerations we do not believe that it can be."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,948.387,952.846,"What provision, what provision of the constitution do you rely on there?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,952.846,961.294,"Well, I think all of these rights have to go back to the Fourteenth Amendment, the right of privacy upon which the Court based its decision in Roe."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.84,1080.238,Does the State of Missouri could lawfully require consent of the spouse to any major surgical procedure on the other spouse?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1080.238,1081.951,"No, I do not."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.31,1091.815,"I am not worried whether they did. Can they do so constitutionally, you say they can?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1091.815,1099.34,I think it is less -- I think it would be harder to void such statutes than they would in this area.
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.888,1356.935,Does the State of Missouri recognize the doctrine of emancipation of person by marriage?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1356.935,1364.014,"Once the minor would be married, the only -- the parental consent clause only applies to unmarried minors under 18."
1975.74-1151,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.471,1375.681,"Your point is then if she became widowed and was still under 18, the parental consents clause --?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1375.681,1376.698,Even if she already had children.
1975.74-1151,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.698,1377.598,Come back into operation?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1377.598,1379.831,"That is correct, which bring back --"
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.831,1385.528,Does the death of the husband cancels off the emancipation?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1385.528,1387.544,"Yes, particularly in light of this specific stature --"
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1387.544,1390.478,The Supreme Court of Missouri ever held that?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1390.478,1393.832,"Well, the Supreme Court of Missouri of course has never ruled on this statute."
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.257,1395.769,It might come up in other areas.
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1399.914,1403.292,"We have no real, to my knowledge, no real emancipation case."
1975.74-1151,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.033,1532.882,"Mr. Susman, do you disagree with Judge Webster’s view on the parental consent, namely that depends on the ability of the mother to give consent rather than a specific age or do you say no consent at all?"
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1532.882,1538.929,"I do, I think every inform, consent. Doctors face the same question when treating an adult."
1975.74-1151,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.579,1572.939,Your view just to be sure I understand is that the parental consent should neither be required for any age or any state of mentality or anything else for that matter?
1975.74-1151,0,24566,frank_susman,,1572.939,1573.811,That is not correct.
1975.74-1151,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.092,1614.823,Very well Mr. Susman.
1975.74-1151,1,30074,john_c_danforth,,1617.789,1621.925,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-1151,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.387,1911.231,"Attorney General, is there any statute in Missouri that require the consent of the spouse to a medical procedure?"
1975.74-1151,1,30074,john_c_danforth,,1911.231,1912.113,"No, Sir."
1975.74-1151,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.113,1913.05,This is the only one?
1975.74-1151,1,30074,john_c_danforth,,1913.05,1916.734,That is right.
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3324.867,3350.045,"While realizing that marriage, voting, are also fundamental rights upon which the State has imposed certain age limits, I cannot put those personally in the same class as an abortion, because those rights to marriage and those rights to vote are only postponed for a limited and a small number of years, they are rights that are postponed and the damage for postponing, excuse me?"
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3350.045,3356.868,Your answer is that the statutory rape age limits will survive and --?
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3356.868,3357.391,That is correct.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.883,3381.306,"You put the statutory rape age limit in the same category, if that is a valid?"
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3381.306,3382.821,Yes I do.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3382.821,3413.778,"What do you have -- do you have any comment on the problem of a malpractice suit against a doctor based on the claim that the state by statute has said that a minor at the age of twelve or thirteen cannot legally consent in a rape case, therefore, it should follow, would that be the argument, it cannot consent to abortion, and therefore, rendered the doctor, the aborting doctor liable of malpractice?"
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3413.778,3431.56,"I think the malpractice, civil liability of problems in regard to giving abortions to minors is no more nor no less than those of deciding on whether or not any patient, regardless of age is giving an informed consent based on the procedure at hand."
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.56,3436.305,What you are saying is a twelve-year-old girl is capable of giving an informed consent?
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3436.305,3437.111,I think certainly --
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3437.111,3438.072,To an abortion?
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3438.072,3449.511,"-- the number of twelve-year-old girls is much less than the number of thirteen-year-old girls, but I would not be willing a blanket statement that there are no twelve-year-old girls who are capable of giving consent to an abortion."
1975.74-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.511,3458.189,And you say the legislature cannot draw any line on the basis that there are a lot more thirteen-year-olds who are capable than there are twelve-year-olds who are capable?
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3458.189,3474.527,"I do not believe that they can, particularly in light of in this particular statute, the parents can say no for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, even the difference in religious beliefs is for -- there are no guidelines under which their consent can be withheld, it is completely arbitrary."
1975.74-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3474.527,3479.539,Can you tell that without the state courts ever having construed the statute?
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3479.539,3483.416,I think you can because I think the statute is so literal that it cannot be read in any other way.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3492.186,3493.797,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3493.797,3494.037,Thank you.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.691,3501.329,You may have another two-minutes --
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3501.329,3501.868,--Thank you.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.868,3502.802,-- at this time.
1975.74-1151,2,24566,frank_susman,,3502.802,3509.078,First of all the testimony was unequivocal that saline is the procedure of choice for post first-trimester.
1975.74-1151,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.546,3593.236,Thank you gentleman.
