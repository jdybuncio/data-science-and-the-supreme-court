1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,54.142,57.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.354,174.851,"And it's wholly unreviewable, is it not?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,174.851,178.815,Wholly unreviewable held by a number of courts to that effect.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,473.111,476.436,And the Appeals Memorandum is sent back to the Regional?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,476.436,477.745,To the Regional Director.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.745,479.174,And to nobody else?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,479.174,482.404,"To nobody else, that's what they -- these are the two things they want to see."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,482.404,483.375,"Yes, I know that."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,483.375,494.629,This is -- now this is an internal document in which the General Counsel explains to the Regional Director why he thinks the case should go forward.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,529.36,537.14,There is an appeal only in the event the Regional Director decides not to.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,537.14,539.11,That is correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.11,541.373,And how -- what are the mechanics to that appeal?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,542.87,543.17,Oh!
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.068,551.242,"First of all the Regional Director, I suppose, has to advise the charging party --"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,551.242,551.709,He advises --
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.709,552.547,Or if he decided not to.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,552.547,554.344,He advises the charging party.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.991,566.752,And then how is that appeal --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,566.752,577.172,That is a written piece of paper that is sent to the General Counsel indicating why the charging party believes that a complaint should issue in this case.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.723,589.723,"But it's just -- it's an ex parte appeal, the potential chargee is not defined."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,589.723,591.005,"No, no."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,601.389,601.627,He is --
1974.73-1233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.627,602.753,Not simultaneous?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,602.753,603.22,"No, no."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,606.454,606.741,Right.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,606.741,608.538,It's heard ex parte by each side.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.538,612.061,How does the charging -- potential chargee know about it?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,612.061,612.169,Oh!
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.031,627.38,Is that first notice he gets?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,627.38,628.145,Of the appeal.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,631.199,632.085,With the General Counsel -- with the --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,632.085,636.157,"With the Regional Director, he informs the party charged?"
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,636.157,637.175,Who is he?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,637.175,638.433,The Regional Director.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.308,649.536,The chargee.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,649.536,663.536,"So he is put on notice and normally in this situation, not normally but frequently, the Board or the Regional Director's representatives may interrogate the and go on and talk to the charged party to see what his side of the case is."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,663.536,663.596,Now.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,663.596,670.111,"Because you get one side from the charging party, the charged party may have a wholly different point of view."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.111,681.297,"Then the Regional Director, if and only if he decides with or without having sought it by Washington not to file a complaint --"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,681.297,681.405,Yes.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.405,683.01,Then and then only is there an appeal.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,683.01,684.016,That's correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.016,686.699,And it's preliminarily an ex parte appeal.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,686.699,687.049,Yes.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,687.049,693.456,"Later, there may be or is an opportunity by the potential chargee to be heard also in Washington."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,693.456,693.576,Yes.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.576,698.965,And is all -- and it's done on the papers but sometimes also on an oral hearing.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,698.965,708.486,Sometimes on an oral hearing with extensive review of the case in the Office of Appeals because that is assigned to a lawyer who studies it than a group of people study the case.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.163,712.319,And how long it processes this?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,712.319,712.906,"Oh, it might be --"
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.906,713.792,In any given case?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,713.792,715.589,A week or two weeks.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.679,740.476,"Well, just before you finish."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,741.003,741.949,"Alright, let me try it."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,741.949,746.141,Because I didn't know anything about that until I read these briefs in this case.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,754.153,754.8,Issue a choice.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.8,756.704,File a complaint then what?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,756.704,763.77,Then a notice to that effect is sent to the charging party and to the Regional Director and that's the end of it.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.77,766.773,That's the end of it and there's no memo and there's nothing --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,766.773,767.671,There's no -- there's no --
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,767.671,770.306,There are no papers there in that kind of situation that are involve in this case.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,770.306,770.593,That's correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,770.593,771.428,Because there are none.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,771.428,774.47,There are none other than the letter which is a public document because sent to the parties.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.47,774.937,Just a notice?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,774.937,775.596,Yes.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.362,782.143,"So, it's only in the event that the tentative decision or the decision of the Regional Director is reversed."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,782.143,782.563,That is correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.563,784.527,That papers are produced that is --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,784.527,786.024,That's right.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.024,787.401,Among others of this lawsuit.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,787.401,787.88,That's right.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.138,804.659,"And it is under the statute, his ultimate non-reviewable decision that is of the General Counsel."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,804.659,804.887,That is --
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.887,811.863,"It is just something that this is just delegated as a matter within the bureaucracy this portion of it to the Regional Director, right?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,811.863,813.36,The General Counsel has --
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.36,814.955,Has a statutory --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,814.955,815.302,Authority and he is --
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.302,815.781,Authority --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,815.781,816.38,Delegated to the Regional Director.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,816.38,818.356,To decide whether or not to file a complaint if --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,818.356,818.715,That is right.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.715,819.901,The charge has been filed.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,819.901,823.302,That is right and he is delegated to the Regional Director the initial processes in this complaint.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.302,824.859,Part of this decision.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,824.859,825.697,That is correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.697,826.955,Thank you very much.
1974.73-1233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,826.955,832.212,Is he -- the General Counsel has a tenure of office that's fixed by statute --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,832.212,834.217,Four years Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,834.385,837.607,"So he can only be removed for cause, is that not so?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,837.607,840.769,"I believe so, yes."
1974.73-1233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.138,1255.204,Are you saying that the District Court required the General Counsel to prepare material that wasn't in existence in order to --
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1255.204,1256.162,It may.
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.47,1277.831,What page is this?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1277.831,1310.214,Page 10 (a) of the petition for certiorari where the District Court's opinion defend its produced explanatory material including existing documents and those instances were Advice or Appeals Memoranda rely upon the circumstances of the case or some other vague and imprecise reference without delineating what those circumstances are except where they can demonstrate that these documents are exempt under the Act which seems to us just leaves the thing very far-reaching.
1974.73-1233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.214,1315.663,"When they say including existing documents, the inference is perhaps that more than existing document."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1315.663,1317.699,It may well be.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.438,1476.145,"Well, I take it."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1483.087,1484.157,We conceded that.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.66,1487.666,Still do?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1487.666,1491.726,"We -- if I may say, we don't concede it but we don't contest it."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.726,1495.307,"So, we treat the General Counsel separately from the Board for purposes of this case."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1495.307,1502.162,"For this purposes of this case, although if we didn't raise anything because we conceded in the District Court."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.216,1511.015,"So, is your argument just simply on the exemptions rather than on the earlier part of the Act."
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1511.015,1511.781,No.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.401,1567.485,"Mr. Friedman, I gather any question whether the General Counsel is an agency would have been resolved in any of this by the amendment of 1974?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1567.485,1569.334,It may or may not have been.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.802,1573.701,They keep going.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1576.188,1583.314,"Well, that there some legislative history suggesting that perhaps Congress did not intend to deal with subcategories."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.314,1597.585,"Well, let's -- suppose none of the exemptions apply, under what category specified in the early part of the Act would these memoranda -- would Advice or Appeals Memoranda fall?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1597.585,1607.047,"Well, it would certainly be identifiable records under page -- on page 55 of our brief subparagraph 3."
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1607.047,1608.345,At 522.
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1608.345,1614.154,"At 522 (a) (3), they'd be identifiable records."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.561,1626.901,And do you -- do you say that they are not?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1626.901,1628.805,We say they are not any of those three.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.164,1629.943,Any of those three?
1974.73-1233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1629.943,1631.967,But you can see that they are identifiable records?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1631.967,1632.374,Yes.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.033,1635.356,But -- and you say they're not opinions?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1640.446,1641.284,That's correct.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.856,1652.128,Why isn't there a rejection of a complaint and adjudication?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1652.128,1661.757,"Well, because we think that as used in the Freedom of Information Act, what Congress was referring to was a determination of the legal issue."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.014,1670.443,Was it an adjudication under the Administrative Procedure Act?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1670.443,1671.03,It might be.
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.413,1675.329,"Well, is it or isn't it?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1681.916,1683.174,"I think, I think it has."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.417,1695.219,"So your answer is, no it doesn't have the meaning that it does?"
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1695.219,1698.026,I -- I would say not in all cases.
1974.73-1233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.73,1883.035,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
1974.73-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.814,1888.239,I suppose you agree Mr. Friedman that the statute is not a very well drawn statute?
1974.73-1233,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1888.239,1891.772,"Well, it's a [Laughter Attempt] unfortunately, it's a difficult subject."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,1925.531,1929.058,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1995.941,2008.653,Do you think that the Freedom of Information Act could reach the communications between the division of the Department of Justice or the Labor Board and the Solicitor General's Office?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2008.653,2012.51,"Your Honor, in answer to that question."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.772,2138.509,"What if United States Attorney say in the District Court of Missouri, writes back to the criminal division of Justice Department and gives them a set of facts and wants to know whether you go ahead and maintain a prosecution?"
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2154.566,2163.683,I would submit that those are the very types of consultative functions that would be exempt under exemption of b (5).
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.683,2166.568,Even though their discussion strictly of legal points.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2166.568,2175.973,"Well, because the very nature of the hypothetical you gave me Your Honor is one that deals with instructions which are not involved in this case."
1974.73-1233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.563,2215.47,"I understood your position was just generally on the law that if a document falls under the definition of 552 (a) (b) or (c), then it is producible, you don't even get to the exception."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2215.47,2217.087,That's correct.
1974.73-1233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.333,2220.357,"Well, and yet -- well, let me just follow that up."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2247.366,2260.511,"For this reason, Your Honor, I think we read (a) (b) and (c) as being -- as referring to that portion of a document that is the final opinion or the substantive law."
1974.73-1233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.25,2285.492,Is that what the law is available to you as it is to the criminal division if you're only talking about published opinions of Courts of Appeals.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2285.492,2295.48,"What we are talking about here Your Honor as opposed to published opinions, are the secret law if you will of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board."
1974.73-1233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.48,2296.378,Right.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2296.378,2303.923,And I call Your Honor's attention in that regard particularly to the quarterly report of the General Counsel.
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.949,2366.27,"Well, if he proceeds, it got to be made to the Board, I take it."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2366.27,2367.947,"Well, but it is a separate agency."
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.546,2369.792,I didn't -- that isn't what I asked you.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2375.109,2375.217,"Yes, there's no question."
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.217,2377.132,"By the Board, not by the counsel."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2377.132,2377.551,No question.
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.384,2389.336,"Well, that's really say when he turns down, something you say makes the law but he may reasons for turning them down, no doubt he does."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2391.372,2391.991,That's correct.
1974.73-1233,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2439.52,2448.654,Do you think it's a -- do you think the General Counsel's review or adjudicated?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2448.654,2449.221,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.701,2471.517,"Well, they ought to be reviewable then I take it."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2471.517,2473.182,"Well, that's not the before this Court today."
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2476.823,2478.967,But that is unreviewable did they not?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2478.967,2495.362,"The statute makes them unreviewable however there was a statement in Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in the Lockridge case that indicates this Court has never pass upon that and there are decision of the DC Circuit and other circuits that indicate, that they might be reviewable on an abusive discretion basis."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.362,2500.572,"Well, if there are adjudications under the ABA you don't need the Freedom of Information Act to require that are made public."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2504.253,2510.934,"Well, Your Honor the fact is that they haven't been and in fact we are one of the very few people who've gotten here and to make them public."
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.042,2527.078,"For you to win under 2 (a), you have to arrive at the conclusion that these are adjudication?"
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2527.078,2528.084,"No, Your Honor I do not."
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.449,2530.288,"That's what I say, under --"
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2530.288,2530.575,Yes.
1974.73-1233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.575,2532.06,"2 (a), you must say there are adjudication."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2532.06,2533.138,That's right.
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.366,2534.492,We'll resume at that point in an hour.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2534.492,2544.48,Thank you.
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.48,2548.851,"Mr. Smetana, you may proceed."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2548.851,2552.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.691,2592.02,"You're talking about both the Advice Memorandum and the Appeals Memorandum, you're lumping them together?"
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2592.02,2592.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.883,2907.851,What page again?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2907.851,2910.681,At page 3 (a) of the respondent's appendix Your Honor.
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.681,2910.96,Yes.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,2910.96,2918.912,And this is from the admitted statement as to how the office works by the General Counsel to the House of Congress.
1974.73-1233,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3073.898,3084.238,"Would you tell me again, how the record shows that an Advice Memo is always followed?"
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3084.238,3085.73,How it shows it's always followed.
1974.73-1233,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3085.73,3088.821,I take it that's your position here.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3088.821,3092.402,"Yes, I think it is shown in a number of ways."
1974.73-1233,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3140.995,3142.545,Is that page 6 Mr. Smetana?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3142.545,3145.467,Of the petitioner's brief.
1974.73-1233,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3145.467,3147.205,The brown covered --
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3147.205,3148.81,Government brief.
1974.73-1233,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3149.816,3150.484,Yes.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3152.888,3158.996,"Now, let me -- if I may come back to the Section 2 (a) and why it's a final opinion."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3213.445,3226.367,"Well, but you're reading 2 (a) as if there was a final opinion within the meaning of 2 (a) in every single instance of adjudication under the Administrative Procedure Act."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3228.556,3242.615,"Well, Your Honor, I must say first of all it is we -- our argument is that it is an agency and this agency has the responsibility for making best decisions with respect to the development of the law and this is how it speaks."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3261.145,3271.447,Does this -- does this sound to you as if it were addressed to this type of prosecutorial decision final opinions including concurring and dissenting opinions?
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3274.583,3277.026,"Well, you do in the nature -- you do in the nature of this agency."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3448.07,3454.884,"MR. Smetana, this memorandum you're talking about on pages 83, 84, 85 of the appendix."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3464.166,3464.932,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.741,3476.633,"Well, take a look at the thing on page 83 through 85."
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3484.957,3485.544,Right.
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.704,3513.317,I forgot what term you used that you said you need to know or you almost implied that it was impaired for you to know.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3521.389,3521.557,"No, --"
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.557,3532.264,This statute contemplates that you should know his thought processes any more than people can find out the thought processes or reasons why certiorari is denied in this Court sometimes.
1974.73-1233,1,26157,gerald_c_smetana,,3532.264,3538.599,"I think the test Your Honor is that there's no question this is the law of this agency, that's how he proceeds."
1974.73-1233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3641.534,3644.707,I think your time is used up Mr. Friedman.
