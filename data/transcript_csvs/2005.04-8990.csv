2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,2.938,We'll hear argument next in House v. Bell.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,4.282,7.886,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.04-8990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,9.824,13.773,Why don't you raise the level of the podium a little so we can hear you?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,13.773,17.889,"--Is that better, Your Honor?"
2005.04-8990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,17.889,19.733,Not much.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,19.733,28.391,One more sound check.
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,28.975,30.485,Thank you.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,30.485,30.913,--Thank you.
2005.04-8990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.34,56.272,Was that because there was no such analysis at the time?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,56.272,57.794,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-8990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,57.794,60.732,How many years ago was this trial?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,60.732,64.93,"The trial, Your Honor, was approximately 20 years ago."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.946,89.957,"The district court heard that, though, didn't it?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,89.957,91.728,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.728,92.078,And didn't believe it.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,99.875,113.399,"Justice Scalia, the court made a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from the tube had spilt after... after the blood had been tested."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.359,122.891,That... is that a conclusion of law?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,122.891,124.152,"It is, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.132,133.893,I don't care what part it put it in.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,153.387,181.185,"--Your Honor, what the district... what the district court concluded as a matter of law was that it... that notwithstanding Dr. Blake's testimony regarding the source of the blood found on Mr. House's jeans, that that did not eliminate the... eliminate the testimony of Agent Scott who said that he saw blood on the jeans when he first... excuse me."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.426,213.209,"On that point... on that one point, do you contend that the district court was clearly erroneous?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,213.209,214.703,Your Honor--
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.703,222.35,"On that one point of the blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on... or the victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,226.215,228.903,"--Justice Scalia, we actually make two claims regarding that."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.562,236.173,What's your... what's your second point?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,236.967,243.009,"--Second, Justice Scalia, if indeed it was a finding of fact, yes, that finding of fact was clearly erroneous."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.009,246.792,--On the basis solely of the testimony of... of this expert.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,246.792,256.617,"Your Honor, on the basis of the entirety of the record, which is what this Court instructed the district court to examine when it conducts the Schlup inquiry."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.617,264.348,"Including the contrary testimony that said if it had been the result of a spill, it would not have been splattered all over, as it was here."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,277.195,311.39,"Your Honor, including not only that testimony, but the testimony of the same expert who made the statements which the Court just cited, who said that she was unable... that she was excluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of blood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony that the transfer stains which she observed, the type of stains which she observed could, in fact, have been... that she had no opinion as to the cause of those, only that it was the result of one object wiping against another object."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.016,317.693,Excuse me.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,354.665,356.159,--Justice Scalia--
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.159,361.119,"And on... just on the blood thing alone, I... I find that a hard burden to bear."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,361.119,366.761,"--Justice Scalia, there... there are two things which come into the... into the Court's analysis."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,415.297,417.152,What did it rest on?
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,428.904,438.063,"Your Honor, quite frankly, we can't determine that... that statement rests on anything."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.074,504.682,"It also contained the testimony of an expert who said that if the tube spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind of spatterings that... that were incriminating in this case."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,511.985,517.693,"Your Honor, two... two things to... two things to point out there."
2005.04-8990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.334,592.211,"I have two questions on the blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I won't take too much of your time."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,611.36,628.489,"Justice Kennedy, in terms of the... the size of... of the bloodstains, it was significant to the extent that it bears upon the probative value of the testimony of Charles Scott when he says... when he said he saw what he thought might be stains."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.035,715.767,"That... that would be an important point if, in fact, it conclusively established that the blood was not the blood of the victim, but I don't think it does conclusively establish that, and if it doesn't, the... the less than perfect performance of counsel is... is no basis for setting aside the conviction."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,715.767,717.789,"Your Honor, two matters on that."
2005.04-8990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.961,795.915,Justice Scalia said blood of the victim.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,804.307,805.817,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-8990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.817,810.35,There's no question about it being someone else's blood.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,810.35,812.872,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.269,821.619,Right.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,849.661,854.787,"Justice Scalia, I... I would disagree with... with the Court's analysis there."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.668,884.522,It's much more than that.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,884.522,888.138,"--Let me rephrase that, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.18,899.224,Any reasonable juror would have had to have a reasonable doubt.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,899.224,901.168,"--Yes, thank you, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,901.168,901.501,All right.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,907.044,909.232,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,909.232,916.452,"So the... so the... we would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled in your favor, that we think the trial judge is unreasonable."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,916.452,921.662,"Your Honor, that's actually not correct either."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.516,947.115,"Oh, but surely he's supposed to make factual determinations."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,984.999,991.219,"Your Honor, first, we... we believe we have... have shown that it's clearly erroneous."
2005.04-8990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1034.81,1041.781,"Are you going to mention any of the other, or are we going to just deal with the blood today?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1041.781,1047.752,"Justice O'Connor, we... we would like to move on to... to some of the other evidence because it... it is substantial."
2005.04-8990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.295,1067.001,"Will you also cover, because your time is short, if you get through the gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are your constitutional claims that lie behind it?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1075.976,1084.124,"Justice Ginsburg, as... as I mentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.433,1196.429,But... but the... the injuries on the body are simply not consonant with... with that manner of her... of her death.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1212.558,1215.757,"Justice Scalia, there... there are two issues there."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1273.718,1280.354,"You've mentioned... in response to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention... and perhaps it was inadvertent."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1300.931,1302.692,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.692,1304.286,So you're going to make that Brady claim.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1304.286,1306.308,We... we are going to also make the Brady claim.
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1336.126,1340.326,"Counsel, could I step... step back a little bit to get... to get back to the standard of review?"
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1349.933,1352.255,"That is correct, Justice Roberts."
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.255,1363.341,"We are supposed to look at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the old evidence, and determine simply whether or not it would be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict on the basis of all of that evidence."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1363.768,1375.27,"Your Honor, what Schlup says is that we are to step back and see whether it is more likely than not that no... that any reasonable juror would vote to convict."
2005.04-8990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.27,1378.292,Any reasonable juror would have to have a reasonable doubt.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1378.292,1379.896,"Would have... would have... that's correct, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.896,1386.022,"So, in other words, no reasonable juror... no... no juror could reasonably vote to convict."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1401.307,1404.411,"Chief Justice Roberts, I--"
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1404.411,1408.11,Under my hypothetical there are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1408.11,1419.873,"--Chief Justice Roberts, the danger in that hypothetical is that we are approaching an area where the definition of the reasonable juror becomes something subjective."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.672,1446.504,"Well, Schlup shouldn't... shouldn't have expressed it that way then."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1460.528,1471.863,"--Your Honor, I believe the Court in... I believe the Court in Schlup took the word reasonable to encompass the point which I have just made."
2005.04-8990,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1471.863,1481.355,"Well, didn't... you... you have accepted Justice Scalia's formulation, but my understanding is that Schlup did not say no reasonable juror could."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1485.481,1487.491,"And that's correct, Justice Souter."
2005.04-8990,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1487.491,1488.352,"But I mean, it's would, not could."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1488.352,1489.102,It... it is would.
2005.04-8990,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.102,1499.005,"Could would imply a sufficiency of evidence possibility of analyzing it, but the would language excludes a sufficiency of evidence."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1510.757,1511.268,"That is, Justice Souter."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.268,1515.716,"Or more precisely, what would all reasonable jurors have done."
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1515.716,1518.588,"What would any reasonable juror, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-8990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.588,1519.498,All reasonable jurors.
2005.04-8990,0,41624,stephen_m_kissinger,,1519.498,1523.365,I believe the language is any.
2005.04-8990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.085,1531.345,"Thank you, Mr. Kissinger."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1533.356,1543.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.4,1592.161,How was... how was that?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1633.992,1638.358,--That was specifically discredited by the... by the testimony of Agent Bigbee.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.358,1639.035,Who said?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1639.035,1649.276,"Dr. Blake's specific opinion was that his interpretation of the enzyme marker study, specifically the GLO1 enzyme on the jeans and on the vial--"
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.276,1649.787,Right.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1649.787,1650.882,--showed inc... inc--
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1650.882,1651.399,Yes.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1651.399,1654.653,--which he took to mean incomplete penetrance.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.653,1655.281,Yes.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1655.281,1661.717,"Agent Bigbee specifically disputed not only the literal interpretation of that, in that it doesn't mean incomplete penetrance."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.886,1673.303,Which meant what?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1673.303,1675.924,Which Dr. Blake concluded that--
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.924,1678.262,"Was incomplete, and what did the FBI man say it was?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1678.262,1685.566,"--Agent Bigbee testified... or Dr. Blake testified that the inc meant that the enzyme was not present, that it had dropped out."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1685.566,1686.744,He... he says it meant incomplete.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1688.765,1690.526,Dr. Blake said it was not present.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.82,1698.44,"--Now... I... Dr. Blake, you just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1698.44,1699.35,--That's correct.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.35,1704.132,"And you say Dr. Bigbee discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.132,1704.643,It's Agent Bigbee.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.393,1705.776,It meant something else.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1706.653,1709.425,Agent Bigbee testified that inc means--
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.425,1709.825,Means.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1709.825,1710.519,--inclusive--
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1710.519,1711.446,Fine.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1712.113,1713.123,--which means that the enzyme is present--
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.123,1713.623,"--Fine, okay."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1713.623,1714.623,--but that he could not subtype it.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1714.623,1715.05,They don't know how much.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1738.732,1745.202,But the... the dispute goes beyond the literal interpretation of the inc.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.083,1791.91,"But it would have been the easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you think that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX, contrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated in the blood spot, do a test."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1821.386,1822.897,"--Your Honor, that--"
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.897,1823.657,The blood did not deteriorate.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1834.743,1837.431,--Dr. Blake was not reading his own report.
2005.04-8990,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1850.777,1854.81,So Bigbee... Bigbee was explaining what he meant when he wrote inc.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1854.81,1855.76,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.76,1857.32,And it was different than what Dr. Blake said it meant.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1857.32,1858.081,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.051,1871.021,"The district court heard all of this, didn't it, all this evidence, and... and didn't the district court make a factual finding?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1871.021,1871.954,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.365,1880.168,"I mean, we... we can call in these witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all again, but we usually accept the factual findings of the trier of fact."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1880.168,1881.012,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.379,1891.099,But does that finding rest on the conclusion that Dr. Blake was not credible and Agent Bigbee was credible?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1891.099,1900.079,--I think that that conclusion implicitly includes a finding that Agent Bigbee was... was credible and Dr. Blake was not credible.
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.079,1901.673,And that Dr. Blake was not credible.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1901.673,1902.617,There were additional--
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.617,1904.539,And who... what was Dr. Blake's background?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1904.539,1908.571,--Dr. Blake's background is... is that he was a forensic pathologist.
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.571,1910.931,Employed often by the State?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1910.931,1913.019,He was often employed by the State.
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.296,1940.0,So you're... you're basically arguing he was not a credible witness.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1940.0,1942.078,"--He was not a credible witness, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.078,1943.838,What... what is the answer to my question?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2018.428,2021.377,"Your Honor, Agent Bigbee specifically testified that the enzyme was there."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.377,2021.877,He did?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2022.377,2029.263,He specifically testified on page 282 of the joint appendix.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.473,2034.9,Let's--
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2034.9,2035.733,--and said it wasn't.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.733,2041.953,"--It doesn't mean it isn't present isn't quite the same thing, is it?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2041.953,2047.264,Agent Bigbee specifically testified that the enzyme was present.
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.542,2085.563,"Ms. Smith, would... could you focusing on this, what's called a finding, although the district judge himself puts it under conclusions of law, just... the court concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI crime laboratory received and tested the evidence."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2099.253,2115.626,"--The specific basis identified explicitly in the opinion was that Special Agent Scott, when he removed the... the blue jeans from the hamper in Donna Turner's trailer, saw what appeared to be bloodstains on the jeans."
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.071,2177.619,"Yes, but then there was also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene of the crime."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2177.619,2181.901,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure that the evidence is undisputed that it was a dry day."
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2202.905,2203.588,I thought that was--
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2203.588,2204.332,--and it showed up.
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.332,2213.246,"--that it was agreed that there... that the site where the body was found, that that was dry, that that was dry ground."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2216.084,2222.221,I'm not sure that... that it's clear where Mr. House got the mud on his jeans.
2005.04-8990,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.391,2293.194,But... but isn't there also evidence that the spillage in the styrofoam container seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood that was missing from the vial?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2293.194,2297.143,--I think there was testimony that... that the appearance of it seemed to be inadequate.
2005.04-8990,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2311.844,2312.688,"Well, but that's important for this whole question."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2315.043,2317.554,"Your Honor, I think what's important is the point of the spillage."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.315,2346.889,"Another blood question because I... the... you make a point of the... the sheriff having said, well, I... I saw blood on the jeans."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2373.587,2381.068,"--Well, I do think you're wrong, Your Honor, because I... I think that if you look in the record, there are at least four witnesses who indicated that they saw the blood."
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.745,2383.278,How could you have?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2384.089,2390.642,"Well, Your Honor, the... the photographs that you have are photographs that are taken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and sent for testing."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.056,2476.915,"Ms. Smith, could... could you go on to some of the other elements that are contested here?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2484.814,2496.41,"Your Honor, I... I think of all the evidence presented below, I think that the confession evidence is... is perhaps the least reliable in terms of... of the Schlup analysis."
2005.04-8990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2496.41,2500.525,What did the jury hear about Muncey's confession?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2500.525,2503.88,The jury was never informed of Muncey's confession because the--
2005.04-8990,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.88,2504.363,I thought not.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2504.363,2510.35,--the fact of Muncey's confession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the trial had already been concluded.
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2516.737,2519.342,But wasn't the district court incorrect in that?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2541.679,2544.023,"--Well, that's what the witness testified to, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2544.023,2552.253,"Well, is there any reason not... did the... did the district court explain that it was rejecting that element of the witnesses' testimonies?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2552.253,2555.119,The district court did not specifically address that element of the witnesses' testimony.
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2561.679,2573.264,"I know, but without getting to that point, it sounds as though the district court simply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the evidence that the witness didn't wait at all."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2573.264,2579.734,"--Your Honor, regardless of whether the witness waited or not, the Court examined the credibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't credible."
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2579.734,2587.048,"Well, but one of the reasons for the finding of... of incredibility was the decade or more of silence."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2587.048,2596.874,"That was one of the reasons, but the primary reason that the... that the confession itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and that was what the court specifically pointed to in his opinion."
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2596.874,2599.812,"Well, the... tell... help me out here."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2613.335,2615.012,"There were several disparities, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2631.985,2636.184,"Well, as far as that's concerned, she did testify that there was a car out there."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2636.184,2636.95,That's correct.
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2636.95,2647.186,And the rest of the story doesn't... doesn't put the defendant House at the time of the crime in a car.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2648.33,2653.062,"Your Honor, the... the testimony at trial was ambiguous about the... about the car."
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.862,2692.473,"But they happened at the same time, didn't they?"
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2693.217,2694.478,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.111,2705.396,"--the child testified to what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with that someone."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2705.396,2706.657,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.974,2779.818,"Well, it did have corroboration."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2786.038,2789.561,There was a... a wound to the victim's left forehead.
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.561,2792.165,Was that not consistent with the confession?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2792.165,2797.458,The confession was that Mr. Muncey hit her and she fell and hit her head.
2005.04-8990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.458,2797.858,You tell me yes or no.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2799.896,2803.084,It... it could be consistent with the confession.
2005.04-8990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.201,2825.366,"So overall, if... looking at this... and that's why I think the question about the weight to give to the fact finding is important."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2929.923,2944.291,"Well, Your Honor, to answer your question is if you are at that mental state where you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe that... that evidence is right, maybe I can go one way or another, then I think the respondent prevails in this case--"
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.291,2952.606,"Well, but that... that says if the... it seems to me you're simply saying there would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather than the other."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2958.659,2961.93,"--I think it goes beyond just having sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.723,2978.736,"Justice Breyer has not heard these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know whether... whether, for example, these... this testimony about the confession was credible or not."
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2978.736,2979.919,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-8990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.919,2982.191,And the hearer of... at the trial did have that opportunity.
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2982.191,2985.623,The district court heard both of the... both of the sisters regarding the confession.
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2988.811,2990.239,But... but may I interrupt you?
2005.04-8990,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,3114.391,3115.912,My comment... sorry.
2005.04-8990,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3115.912,3116.445,--analysis?

2005.04-8990,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3162.015,3166.891,"Well, then at... at a minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is... is in question by that."
