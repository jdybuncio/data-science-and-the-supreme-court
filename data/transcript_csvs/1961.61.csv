1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,127.542,132.052,Equivalent or part of which?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,132.052,137.462,"I suppose, Your Honor, a part of the inseparable from commerce."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,158.751,162.107,(Voice Overlap) would you just (Inaudible) for a minute.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,162.107,162.585,Yes sir.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,162.585,167.355,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,167.355,170.304,"The names of the industry -- yes, sir."
1961.61,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,230.414,233.282,That in the ninth replacement?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,233.282,239.86,Alabama Power and International Paper were the two -- were already involved at that time Your Honor.
1961.61,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,304.833,309.639,Did Mobile -- was Mobile taxed in that earlier period under the same statute?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,309.639,310.067,No sir.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,424.974,432.984,Was the -- the local taxation by the local -- prior local distributor contested in the Court Mr. Beggs?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,432.984,435.05,I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,507.675,518.846,Was there -- was there any change in any aspect of the physical transactions in the change of direct sale now by Union Gas against --
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,518.846,522.857,"United Gas, no sir, no physical change at all, but there's only a paper change."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,532.484,535.604,The same continuity of passage of the gas.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,535.604,540.34,Exactly and the same source all gas for the Mobile area comes from the United Gas Pipeline Company.
1961.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.841,544.173,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,544.173,544.974,So far is that --
1961.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.974,547.636,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,547.636,552.105,"Well, I don't need mean to -- suggest that it's not a perfectly legitimate change but as far --"
1961.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,552.105,564.129,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,564.129,569.018,"They contracted with United and said, “We'll do the same servicing as your agent, we formerly did when we're going to sell it.”"
1961.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.018,571.842,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,571.842,573.242,"Yes, sir."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,601.831,610.488,"What was prior -- prior to this, just for you to make an arrangement, what was the inter-corporate relation, if any, between Mobile and United, I'm not (Voice Overlap)"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,610.488,611.688,"None, whatsoever, Your Honor."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,611.688,612.064,What?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,612.064,612.705,None whatsoever.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,612.705,613.218,None.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,613.218,613.667,None at all.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,618.799,638.865,"Mr. Beggs, at that time, was there some point to which you can slip in where the interstate commerce ended and intrastate commerce began as respect to the gas distributed in Mobile?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,638.865,645.934,"Your Honor, the tax here levied is not on the gas or movement of the gas, but it is on the local privilege of selling."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,684.74,706.687,"In all those -- in those cases on which -- which -- on which you rely, were those cases where there were ownership of the commodity sold, the physical transfer from out-of-state directly through the out-of-state seller into the hands of local the buyer?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,706.687,709.73,Yes sir the transfer of possession was the answer in support in the tax.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,711.494,730.038,"I understand -- I know that case, but what -- that was not a case where the whole transaction from the beginning of the commercial transactions to the end was in the control of, in the direction of, in the ownership of the interstate business enterprise."
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,730.038,731.02,I was under the impression that until --
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,731.02,735.2,There was -- there was break in -- in McGoldrick and Berwind-White.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,769.71,786.867,"It depends on what the tax -- taxable entities Your Honor and may I read from the ordinance, “Each person --” this is page 84 of the record and I think the Court of Appeals misconstrued the tax ordinance and -- and felt that it was a tax on the privilege of delivery that thing and speaks always of delivering."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,821.072,828.149,Well I know but the fact that the sale takes place there doesn't answer the Commerce Clause question?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,828.149,828.913,If the tax Your Honor --
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,828.913,829.784,It may answer.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,847.662,863.202,"Well, if time permits, I would like to discuss some of the brief -- some of the cases that are in the brief where I believe just that has been held that the state where the transaction comes to fruition is conferred the benefits and he's entitled to tax whether it'd be a gross receipts tax or other form of tax."
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,951.546,971.708,"Mr. Beggs, (Inaudible), would you contend that this transportation by United Gas was interstate in character, all the away to Ideal Burners?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,971.708,972.872,Your Honor I think so.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,982.435,983.712,That's what I want to know.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,996.574,998.145,I agree with that.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,998.145,998.522,Do you?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,998.522,1000.648,I agree that it was -- its movement was interstate.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1000.648,1003.362,"Well, that's what Judge Rives held, wasn't it?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1003.362,1005.723,He held it that -- that the tax was on the movement Your Honor.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1006.76,1009.035,(Inaudible)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1009.035,1012.0,"The movement, but Your Honor it's the movement that is taxed."
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1014.042,1015.795,Do you agree it was all interstate commerce --
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1015.795,1016.771,"The movement Your Honor, yes, sir."
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1016.771,1017.326,-- movement?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1017.326,1020.625,I agree that the movement was but I agree if that is not the event that was taxed.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1020.625,1029.698,"Well then, how can it tax, the privilege or that the city tax privilege of doing interstate business?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1029.698,1032.511,They taxed the privilege of making a local sale Your Honor.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1053.517,1055.165,"Yes, but why?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1055.165,1060.859,Because the Court said that the delivery of possession to the consumer was at its plant site which was is in New York City.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1060.859,1067.753,"And the interstate carried from the commerce had ended at the plant site, hasn't it, where local commerce began?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1068.498,1070.917,"But there was no further transportation, Your Honor."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1127.895,1153.096,"Mr. Beggs may I suggest if you'll permit me, that I think you have to make -- mean the last sentence in per curiam opinion on rehearing on page 128, I say that was written by Judge Rives, but last sentence I think summarizes the conflict and controversy in this case."
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1153.096,1157.239,Yes sir and it points the -- what we conceive to be the error of the Court of Appeals.
1961.61,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1157.239,1157.917,What page?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1157.917,1160.264,That's on page 128 sir.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1178.715,1187.292,We held that the taxes on the act of privilege of delivering the gas in the City of Mobile that -- this on the page 5.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1187.292,1187.921,Yes sir.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.921,1194.09,"This is the incidence of the tax or incident, I take it means that was the tax goes on --"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1194.09,1194.44,Yes.
1961.61,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1213.229,1225.478,What I can't understand I think Mr. Beggs on this is the power of Mobile to levy even a sales tax under the privilege of commerce.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1225.478,1236.233,"I agree Your Honor they do not have the right to levied on the privilege of commerce, but the commerce umbrella does not give to the out-of-state seller, the right to come within the city and complete a local sale."
1961.61,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1254.232,1276.389,"The difference between this I gather and in sale a coal, is that the coal is a tangible thing, if it were to come there and the company held it in its place and some local broker acted as salesman, you would say that the city could collect the tax for the sale of the coal and as I gather, you're arguing the same thing about this gas?"
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1276.389,1280.96,The dis -- difference of the physical property is ought not to produce a different result and has not in this Court.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1290.533,1294.447,But -- that is not the case as I understood that Justice Black gave you.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1297.421,1298.391,"Oh sir, a local."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1298.391,1299.402,About this case?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1299.402,1300.769,"No sir, no."
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1303.638,1303.903,(Voice Overlap)
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1303.903,1306.067,I would like if I may to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.
1961.61,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1306.067,1308.806,What is the local dealer knew?
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1308.806,1311.993,He sells to his -- all the other customers in the city except these seven.
1961.61,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1318.94,1321.42,To be convenient (Voice Overlap).
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.42,1324.441,There might be business reasons why you can't do it.
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1324.441,1325.469,That's true.
1961.61,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1325.469,1341.024,"-- in the domain of taxation, in the domain of commerce, business arrangements are made which may carry undesirable consequences and you can hypothetically say you wouldn't -- you wouldn't encounter all hypothetically (Voice Overlap)."
1961.61,0,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,1342.1,1343.049,Yes sir.
1961.61,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1343.049,1343.975,Mr. Rhyne.
1961.61,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1343.975,1346.188,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1379.576,1382.266,Maybe it wouldn't -- maybe it wouldn't Mr. Rhyne.
1961.61,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1389.078,1389.643,"Well, that --"
1961.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1389.643,1391.883,"It's sometimes are, it's sometimes can't be."
1961.61,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1391.883,1410.321,"It would be an identical situation because this gas comes to city gate and it's commingled with all the other gas and until -- and it goes trough the same lines as all the other domestic gas handled by mo -- Mobile Gas service, it reduces the pressure and all of that kind of thing and so some of the gas goes into this plant and some other goes to Joe Dox next door."
1961.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1410.321,1418.388,But -- but then it'd be all of the difference in the world between dealing with six big commercial consumers and dealing with thousands local consumers?
1961.61,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1418.388,1418.458,I -- I'd like --
1961.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1418.458,1419.754,All the difference in the world?
1961.61,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1419.754,1432.251,I grant you just a matter of convenience only because they could have a contract with Joe Dox who uses this -- a tiny little bit of gas as much as they can have a contract with that -- tremendous use or such as involved here.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2277.822,2280.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2436.418,2449.6,"May I ask you if the City of Mobile had attempted to make any of the gas companies delivering gas in the Mobile like United, get a license as a prerequisite to doing the interstate business?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2449.6,2456.587,"Mr. Justice Black, insofar as I know there's been no compulsion in the sense that processes had been issued or anything else."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2456.711,2457.723,Was there any effort or do you know?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2460.375,2463.681,I am not familiar with Alabama law and all of its detail sir.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2492.615,2500.948,"Well, I suppose, wouldn't we, we would have that question before us not in theory but in fact that Mobile had tried to do that?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2500.948,2508.774,I think that you have that in fact why -- this case -- you could make short trip to this case about any question at all Mr. Justice Black.
1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2570.6,2576.197,Do you think Section 16 has got nothing to do with your argument which in the ordinance?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2576.197,2579.088,"Well, I think it does --"
1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2579.088,2587.989,Or it provides that no provision of this clause should be applied (a) so as to impose any unlawful tax or unlawful burden on the interstate commerce and so forth?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2587.989,2589.38,Yes.
1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2600.777,2604.791,(Voice Overlap) I was thinking it would have a bearing on the construction of the statute.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2604.791,2611.502,And -- and Justice Rives so treated it sir -- Judge Rives in the court below so treated it as having an important bearing on it.
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2611.502,2620.962,"Well, how does Section 16 help us to determine this by itself what is or what is not in any unlawful tax on interstate commerce?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2620.962,2623.956,"Well, it is -- it is a self-executing completion Justice."
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2623.956,2628.949,Well it doesn't -- it doesn't -- it helped us to ascertain when it is and when it isn't.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2628.949,2629.26,But it --
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2629.26,2632.206,If it is then it -- and it's not included.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2632.206,2633.081,That is correct.
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2633.081,2635.315,"But the whole question is, is it or isn't?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2635.315,2637.359,Well let me go by -- oh excuse me sir.
1961.61,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2637.359,2641.863,We'll recess now.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2642.551,2645.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2697.559,2704.427,"(Inaudible), I thought that you were (Inaudible) the statute as a whole or (Inaudible)"

1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2705.984,2709.203,(Inaudible)
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2709.203,2737.008,"Now, treating a further with the statute as a whole, I say that this is a licensing ordinance because not only does it so state and requires outright in so many words, a license to conduct any business of any nature and you need to make deliveries and to enter the city to do business."
1961.61,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2760.534,2764.004,(Inaudible)
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2764.004,2769.555,"Yes, Mr. Justice, I guess I have the wrong page reference to Section 18."

1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2778.918,2780.147,"Oh, 15, I am sorry."
1961.61,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2780.147,2780.628,15.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2780.628,2782.218,It is Section 15.
1961.61,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.218,2783.049,(Inaudible)?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2783.049,2786.166,Yes.
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2915.066,2917.604,Before you move on --
1961.61,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2917.604,2928.498,Is it your understanding this license of the -- that the pipeline company is required to pay the license before it starts to operate in the --
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2928.498,2940.261,"If it had not operated previously, Mr. Chief Justice, that would be the case and for it to continue to operate the thrust of the license -- the ordinance is such that it must pay it."
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2940.261,2969.268,"May I ask if since you evidently -- inadvertently referred to the Section 15, before you directed me, I looked at it and that it has the comprehensive description of whether amount of the license is making the trend or so on and so on or amount of sales, this ordinance except where otherwise specified."
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,2985.562,3002.101,"I can answer as to gas companies, there's no other thing specified otherwise specified as to whether the ordinance in all of its at least more than 193 sub-provisions as to separate businesses so specified Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I cannot say."
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3002.101,3009.794,"Then I -- perhaps I would ask Mr. Beggs when he gets on his feet again, I assume he will."
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3042.285,3045.756,"Well I think it was argued, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3045.756,3047.246,Was there any -- were you in the argument?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3047.246,3049.323,"No, I was not sir."
1961.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3049.323,3050.861,Well I'll ask him --
1961.61,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3050.861,3062.666,"Section 193, standing by itself (Inaudible)?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3062.666,3078.78,"If we have a standing by itself, Mr. Justice Harlan, my position would be the same that even as construed by appellant that this is not a gross receipts tax, but it is a license tax on sales measured by gross receipts."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3115.939,3135.228,(Voice Overlap) may I ask you how you can rely on the provision which says that the tax must be paid as a prerequisite for doing business at the same time rely on 193 which allows the company to do business a whole year in order to determine how much to pay the next year.
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3135.228,3150.763,"Well that is -- as I understand it Mr. Justice Black, that is the situation of what is owed by a company that has have the past experience that they can assess the license tax for the current year on the basis of what they have done the previous year."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3150.763,3154.424,"But suppose it's started the first of this year, then it never been done business there, what --"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3154.424,3159.345,"Then, as I understand that they have a two months period during which a --"
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3159.345,3160.146,Where is that?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3160.146,3171.824,To pick up the -- I believe that is Section 15 of the ordinance on page 84 and 85 Mr. Justice Black.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3171.824,3172.907,"Section what, 15?"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3172.907,3174.969,15.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3208.631,3212.162,What is the minimum for a gas company?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3212.162,3214.023,"That sir, I do not know off hand."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3214.023,3215.241,"Not in their business, not in their --"
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3215.241,3219.155,I do not believe that there is a specified minimum not to my recollection.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3219.155,3224.21,No way to access there -- their (Inaudible) except to find out what business they did in preceding years (Voice Overlap)
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3224.21,3228.672,That -- That made through an omission be the case sir.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3228.672,3229.294,Through what?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3229.294,3231.019,I say that may through an omission be the case.
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3231.019,3232.394,Why was it an omission?
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3232.394,3233.593,"Well, I can't say."
1961.61,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3235.391,3253.146,"(Voice Overlap) the law which prescribes that company that's going to do business to gas company for a year and the next year, it's based on the gross tax, which certainly is not consistent with saying that the law at the same time means that they got to pay the tax as a prerequisite for doing business."
1961.61,2,33620,james_lawrence_white,,3253.146,3263.417,"I think that certainly in that event Mr. Justice Black, they would have to pay it the next year to continue doing the business and it would be every business much a license for that purpose sir."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,4934.962,4937.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.61,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5022.952,5028.675,Whether that to say then that an interstate carrier may not make a sale?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5028.675,5029.263,"No, no."
1961.61,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5029.263,5031.982,-- locally if he makes the sale?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5031.982,5034.481,The interstate carrier may sell his own commodity.
1961.61,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5040.238,5046.362,It then became interstate commerce -- interstate commerce all the way up to the consumers' burners?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5046.362,5046.775,Yes sir.
1961.61,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5046.775,5049.277,"And right at that point, it became local in character."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5049.277,5050.681,May I make this distinction Your Honor?
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5102.445,5109.689,"Mr. Beggs, may I ask you this, as I understand it, there were seven large commercial consumers, is that right?"
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5109.689,5110.336,Yes sir.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5110.336,5111.944,Only two are before this Court?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5111.944,5112.971,Yes sir.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5112.971,5118.058,Did the other five in the vernacular pulled up or is that -- or that case pending.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5118.058,5119.269,They paid out Your Honor.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5119.269,5119.561,Pardon me?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5119.561,5120.111,They paid out.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5120.111,5121.985,There is no -- that controversy is out --
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5121.985,5123.386,"It's out, yes sir."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5123.386,5129.13,"In any event, I want to ask this question."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5140.127,5141.598,"I believe you follow the state decision, yes sir."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5141.598,5142.286,Yeah.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5160.382,5161.305,"No sir, I'd like --"
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5161.305,5165.141,Because -- because it's -- I'll tell you why there's such (Inaudible).
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5173.236,5174.944,"Yes, sir."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5174.944,5177.121,The Alabama Supreme Court wouldn't be bound by it.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5177.121,5177.986,No sir.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5177.986,5183.827,"The Alabama Supreme Court makes next year may find, they conclude the Judge Rives is right in construing that ordinance."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5183.827,5184.836,May I make two answers?
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5194.481,5194.967,That's right.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5194.967,5195.534,He construed it.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5199.221,5203.161,I'm not giving -- my question isn't implied any weight either way.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5203.161,5215.602,"Now, the second answering it another way, what has been overlooked so far by Mr. White hasn't been called to the Court's attention in this construction of the statute is the backing up state statute which authorizes city ordinance."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5218.092,5223.007,"But doesn't tell me at least, maybe it tells it to others what the ordinance means?"
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5223.007,5245.857,"It does make clear though Your Honor that the tax is limited to sales and it's not on transportation and it's also makes clear that the tax is only on the sales of the previous year and that -- that state enabling act has been before the Alabama Supreme Court and the Alabama Supreme Court held that where an utility was purchased by a new purchaser, it cannot be taxed on the sales of the seller in the previous year."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5245.857,5246.346,But --
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5246.346,5250.584,"But to remedy that, the legislation then added a cause that's in here now but it wasn't there at that time."
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5250.584,5258.288,"But Mr. Beggs, It wouldn't be the first ordinance that held by a state court to have exceeded the enabling act."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5258.288,5260.962,I agree that this precise point is not the best part.
1961.61,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5286.77,5289.242,"Alright, that may mean that for the first year you go free."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5289.242,5289.491,Yes.
1961.61,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5292.773,5297.586,What is the economics of this? What's the dollar amount of the taxes involved?
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5297.586,5305.695,"Last year that we paid in 1958 was something over a hundred thousand dollars on these two industries, alone I believe."
1961.61,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5314.354,5316.535,Judge Thomas is a Mobile lawyer.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5316.535,5319.433,Yes sir and former state secretary.
1961.61,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5319.433,5324.414,This is -- this is rather curious from litigation.
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5332.389,5334.487,I'm sure their heart is any more than rest of us.
1961.61,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5338.614,5340.426,"Oh, I understand that (Voice Overlap)."
1961.61,3,21901,e_dixie_beggs,,5340.426,5342.669,Yes sir.
