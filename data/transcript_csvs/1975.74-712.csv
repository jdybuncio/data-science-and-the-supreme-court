1975.74-712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.936,"We will hear arguments next in 74-712, United States against Bornstein."
1975.74-712,0,28752,jones,,50.346,53.793,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-712,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,366.867,371.929,"Did Model paid it or did they, was it withheld from the Government payment to Model?"
1975.74-712,0,28752,jones,,371.929,385.159,"Well I think that the Government owed Model monies in connection with some other contract and that the $16,000.00 odd here was withheld from that other payment."
1975.74-712,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,385.159,394.807,"In this connection, is, are the respondents responsible, liable to Model?"
1975.74-712,0,28752,jones,,399.651,419.175,"Well, that raises two questions, one of contract law that I cannot answer because these respondents are individuals and I do not know whether they would be liable in contact to Model Engineering, it was their corporation, United National Labs that actually was in the privative contract relation with Model."
1975.74-712,1,45940,william_rossmoore,,1695.132,1698.696,"Yes Sir, may I—Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1975.74-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.92,1891.806,Where in your brief is that?
1975.74-712,1,45940,william_rossmoore,,1891.806,1900.117,"That is on pages four and five of my brief, Sir."
1975.74-712,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1996.742,2005.071,"Well as applied to this case, do you think that operates as much of a deterrence for this kind of corrupt conduct on the part of the contractors?"
1975.74-712,1,45940,william_rossmoore,,2005.071,2015.269,"Well, the deterrent effect as it works out in this case may, certainly is not as great as if you impose 35 forfeitures."
1975.74-712,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.402,2064.56,There is nothing uncommon about having civil penalties in a situation like this be a vastly more of them criminal in terms of--
1975.74-712,1,45940,william_rossmoore,,2064.56,2067.231,"Nothing at all, and in many cases it so works out."
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,2667.286,2670.252,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-712,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2865.143,2876.075,Does Congress’ numerous statutes provided these kinds of deterrent civil penalties in very large amounts?
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,2876.075,2877.734,"I think you are right, Sir."
1975.74-712,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2878.524,2883.785,"Very well, from the civil penalty being much-much greater than the criminal penalty."
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,2883.785,2896.941,"Well, we are dealing with this statute and how it has been interpreted, the Government -- the petitioner has relied heavily on Marcus and Hess, which is the only Supreme Court decision to deal with the question of multiple forfeitures."
1975.74-712,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.855,2973.808,"Well supposing, I am hurt in an automobile accident and I incurred $2,000.00 hospital bills, and as approximate result of the negligence of the driver at the other car."
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,2986.712,2990.976,"No, I would not say that, I would agree with the implication of your question."
1975.74-712,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3017.877,3026.802,"Well as a matter of principle, I would think you would extend proximate cause further when you are dealing with someone who defrauds than with someone who is merely negligent."
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,3026.802,3039.347,"Well Sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in this case our problem is that the upper limits of that are totally beyond our control and do result in very unfair consequences."
1975.74-712,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3086.061,3093.008,"Okay, that is an argument on the forfeitures point, but you are making an argument on the double-damages point."
1975.74-712,2,29077,jack_ballan,,3093.008,3115.267,"Well on that, I making a statutory argument, Sir, and I am referring to the rationale of the client case, which is the only Circuit Court decision on this matter, and in that case, they read the statute, which does not provide for when the doubling takes place."
1975.74-712,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.286,3171.565,Mr. Jones.
1975.74-712,3,28752,jones,,3171.565,3186.294,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, I just wanted to address myself to the argument that there is some difference between the revised statutes and the False Claims Act, as codified in the 31 USC."
1975.74-712,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3211.242,3228.199,"What if you should just look though to the act of the subcontractors as your opponents are suggesting, and say that what is forbidden by RS 3490 is the doing or committing of the act, the subcontractor's act is single in submitting the thing to the prime."
1975.74-712,3,28752,jones,,3228.199,3243.898,"The reason I think that that is inappropriate analysis is that the doing or committing such act refers to the act described in 5438, and the acts described in the 5438 are the causing of false claim to be submitted."
1975.74-712,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.898,3249.087,"Okay, how many times do the subcontractor in this case cause a false claim to be submitted?"
1975.74-712,3,28752,jones,,3249.087,3250.703,35.
1975.74-712,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.703,3253.954,I would think you could argue equally well that it did it once.
1975.74-712,3,28752,jones,,3253.954,3265.022,"Well, he argues that his fraudulent course of the conduct constituted a single causative act or that is that essence as I take it of that argument."
1975.74-712,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3316.896,3317.622,Thank you gentlemen.
