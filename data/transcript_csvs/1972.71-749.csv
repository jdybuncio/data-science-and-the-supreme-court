1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.169,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 71-749, United States against Kras."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,38.141,41.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,289.329,291.486,"This man was on welfare, right?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,291.486,293.066,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,293.066,297.023,"And if I understand welfare correctly, you get enough money to live on, do you?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,297.023,298.338,That is correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,298.338,300.26,But why does he not get the $60.00?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,300.26,319.332,"Well, if he doesn't -- what I am saying Justice Marshall, if he doesn't as he says, expect to get any income, his welfare benefits are exempt from his creditors, so that what he is saying is, I want the discharge, the reason a person wants a discharge is so that any future earnings, nonexempt earnings --"
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.332,321.487,Sometime after six months?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,321.487,340.651,"Well, what in effect Congress is saying is that when you need it, come and we will let you file your petition, and when those earnings that you expect and you want to immunize become a reality, as those earnings come in, you can pay us out this $40.00 over a period of six to nine months."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,354.763,359.162,"Well, why is -- why not look the other way, why is the reasoning can't get?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,359.162,360.797,"Well, because Congress has decided --"
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,360.797,363.268,Because he doesn't have $50.00?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,363.268,363.901,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.901,365.675,That's the only reason.
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,365.675,366.298,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,366.298,367.269,That's the only reason.
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,367.269,368.87,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,395.765,399.635,"The deficit is around a million dollars a year, that's a great big deficit, isn't it?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,399.635,400.455,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,400.455,401.372,It's a big one.
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,401.372,402.962,It is.
1972.71-749,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,402.962,405.101,But for many years it did --
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,405.101,410.226,"It did operate up until I believe 1968, it operated at a substantial surplus."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.067,570.087,"Did you say that the district court, and I just reread it, sorry, glanced over its decision again, I can't find it in here, that the district court held that the $50.00 fee was not itself dis-chargeable in bankruptcy and will remain liability of the debtor?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,570.087,572.148,"That's correct, that's correct."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.148,573.983,I just didn't see that in its opinion.
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,573.983,578.617,I think it's near the last page or two in this opinion in which the district court said that.
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.051,598.75,"Well, it's just a question then of when the discharge occurs, before or after the payment?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,598.75,599.088,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.088,601.221,But sooner or later he is going to have to pay?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,601.221,606.853,"That's correct, although I don't know where the district court thought he had the power to so provide."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,606.853,624.376,"I wonder since you've now been interrupted, since Congress has left it up to this Court in this general order in bankruptcy to deal with the problem of the installment payments, whether or not an amended general order, it's the new general order that has to deal with the problems in this case or at least go far toward it?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,624.376,633.657,"I don't think that's the case, because I believe the statute provides that you don't get the discharge until you actually pay the fees out in installments."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.657,641.686,I thought the -- we are talking about the statute enacted in what year?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,641.686,659.662,"The 1946 statute, which I believe appears at Page 30 of our brief, which provides that the court shall grant a discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has failed to pay the filing fees required to be paid by this time in full."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.662,663.389,Provided however that in cases of voluntary bankruptcy?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,663.389,669.645,"No, I was -- provided then the fees may be paid in installments, but first --"
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.645,672.505,If so authorized by general orders by the Supreme Court of the United States?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,672.505,673.18,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.228,682.87,Could make it $00.10 a year I suppose?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,682.87,684.24,"Well, I suppose that's so."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.636,703.105,But you don't think the power -- that the Court would have power under the statute by general order to say that there is going to be discharged prior to the payment of the whole $50.00?M
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,703.105,713.474,"No, I wouldn't think so, and the particular portion of the statute that I referred to is Section 14 (c) (8), which appears right at the top of Page 30."
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.474,722.493,"Well, if you string out the time for paying the installments and keep the injunction in force you really in effect have a discharge?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,722.493,739.0,"That's correct, in effect what Congress, as I tried to point out earlier, in effect, Congress is giving the indigent asset-less debtor the benefits of the discharge while he pays out the money that's involved here, rather small sum."
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.0,742.015,"In this case, (Inaudible)?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,742.015,743.094,"Well, I think there is -- it's different --"
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.094,758.084,"I mean, you can collect the fees sometime, or if you can extend the time and in effect get a discharge, you will give him two years at $00.10 a week before he gets the discharge?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,758.084,764.246,"Well, I think what we're arguing about here is whether or not the Congress is going to be struck down as unconstitutional."
1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.505,839.57,"Well, as practical matter, laying aside these constitutional questions, when and if, as Justice White has suggested, the creditors are offered this man’s bag, is it economically feasible to pursue $50.00 item on behalf of the government?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,839.57,844.524,"Well, I think at the moment that's precisely what Congress is studying, whether that is economically feasible."
1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.283,871.764,"If you know, would you refresh my recollection on either policies or regulations of the Department of Justice with respect to claims under certain amounts."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,882.507,886.888,"That may be, but I am just uncertain."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.826,946.603,No state has constitutionally required to have statutes permitting divorce I suppose?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,946.603,956.454,"Well, I would qualify that by saying that at the Boddie and perhaps Griswold versus Connecticut, a state might not be able to wholly arbitrarily deny a divorce."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.339,966.249,"I don't think there is anything, I don't remember anything in Boddie offhand that says that the state has to have provision for dissolution of marriage."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,987.126,988.123,I think that's true.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,993.264,995.629,"Yes, (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,995.629,998.798,-- it involves the dissolution of a rather fundamental human relationship.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.798,1005.265,"It does indeed, and the state might determine that it's not going to permit the dissolution of that fundamental human relationship."
1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.265,1014.248,The present is not central to Boddie that this was a relationship which could not be dissolved in any other way except by judicial action?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1014.248,1014.895,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1081.133,1084.421,But a debtor and creditor can (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1084.421,1085.237,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.511,1130.284,Would you assume that people on welfare aren't harassed by creditors?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1130.284,1148.811,"No, I am not assuming that people on welfare are not -- I am assuming that people who are asset-less and who have as little as this petitioner claims that he has, it would be somewhat foolish of a creditor to waste his money in an attempt to invoke the judicial process to obtain funds."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.811,1155.642,"I didn't say judicial process, I said harassment, telephone calls?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1155.642,1156.624,"That maybe true, but I don't think --"
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1156.624,1161.259,"Lawyers letters, everything you can name."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1167.738,1169.482,Yes.
1972.71-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.023,1333.369,"Mr. Korman, on Page 5 of the appendix is, as I read the respondent's affidavit, he does state that one of the reason he wants to be able to file a petition is to relieve creditor harassment."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1342.784,1348.483,"I think it's a diminishing factor, I think when read in context, when you look at the next sentence that follows that."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.554,1409.607,"Mr. Korman, on that point you said about, when he gets the money, that's when he could pay the $50.00, and he shouldn't file bankruptcy until he gets the money."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1409.607,1412.093,Until he anticipates getting it.
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.093,1429.952,"Now, on this Metropolitan thing, assume it's not bought by the statute and assuming Metropolitan next year reduces that good judgment, what can he do about that 20 years later when he gets enough money to go into bankruptcy?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1429.952,1440.496,"Well, as soon as he gets a job or he is offered a job, he can come in and file his bankruptcy petition and that will in effect immunize his earnings after the petition is filed."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.496,1444.28,How can he get a job with a thousand dollar judgment on him?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1444.28,1453.264,"Well, I assume that -- I am thinking about as a practical matter, if an employer was offering him a job and said, well, you have this thousand dollar judgment against you, I am not going to hire you."
1972.71-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1458.597,1460.535,I see.
1972.71-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1460.535,1470.712,"Mr. Korman, the petition states that the petitioner was falsely discharged by the insurance company."
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1476.525,1479.204,"No, it doesn't."
1972.71-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1479.204,1483.904,"Contingent assets, list of assets in bankruptcy?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1483.904,1489.539,"Well, it was listed as a debt that he wanted to have discharged, that is --"
1972.71-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1489.539,1491.161,"It could have cut both ways, couldn't it?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1503.249,1508.455,"Well, I don't know Justice Powell that New York allows such course of action."
1972.71-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1508.455,1509.73,I don't know either.
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1509.73,1517.095,"And I am not familiar enough, quite frankly, with whether under the bankruptcy law such a contingency would be considered an asset."
1972.71-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1517.095,1518.515,There is nothing in the record on it I guess?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1518.515,1519.498,"No, there isn't."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1519.498,1522.887,And how he couldn't pay the filing fee is to bring some law suit --
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1522.887,1527.708,"Well, there is what we call is -- there is a general in forma pauperis statute."
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.32,1566.268,Was the issue here whether the district court could require a prepayment?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1566.268,1571.263,"The district court -- I am sorry, the district court said that the general in forma pauperis statute is --"
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.263,1575.48,You said in the argument that (Inaudible) was there a demand that he prepaid the fee?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1575.48,1576.05,Yes.
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.934,1586.062,"I know, but I thought the question was how could simply when he file it?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1586.062,1588.214,"No, when he filed -- right, and he said that --"
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.214,1596.077,So they had -- does the practice in the district court require prepayment to take the petition?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1596.077,1596.626,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.345,1605.482,He filed the petition saying he was an indigent?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1605.482,1606.306,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.306,1615.556,"And the district court demand -- would have demanded that, except for its owing one constitutionality would have demanded prepayment, wouldn't have taken the petition at all?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1615.556,1625.069,"No, it would have demanded prepayment or a statement of how he proposed to pay in installments, and he said that he could make no promise to pay in installments."
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.069,1632.579,"So the actual rule is, you may file and if you propose installments, you may file and the process will go forward (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1632.579,1637.135,"That's correct, that's correct, and you get all the advantages of the adjudication."
1972.71-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.135,1639.334,So you have the injunction?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1639.334,1639.752,That's correct.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1639.752,1649.539,"Mr. Korman, you haven't, unless I missed it, dealt with the argument under the statute, 28 U.S.C. 1915 (a)?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1649.539,1656.193,The reason I hadn't Mr. Justice Stewart is because I don't believe that the holding of the district court is contested.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1666.492,1669.034,And that law was enacted when?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1669.034,1670.734,1946 I believe.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1670.734,1676.025,"And when was 1915 (a) last addressed by Congress, do you know?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1676.025,1677.09,I don't know.
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.094,1715.794,"I know that has been the holding, but wouldn't you agree that the plain language of 1915 (a) covers this?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1715.794,1724.971,"Yes, I will have to agree that the plain language does seem to cover it, if you don't consider the particular legislative history involved here."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.971,1733.183,"Now generally or at least the old-fashioned way of statutory construction was that if the plain language was clear, that was the end of it, you didn't look at the legislative history?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1733.183,1733.831,"Well, but there is --"
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1733.831,1735.946,"I grant you, that's a little bit out of style?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1735.946,1744.692,"Well, but the language of the statute clearly indicates that Congress did not want the discharge to be granted till the filing fees were paid in the the legislative history."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.312,1760.263,And assumes the ability to pay?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1760.263,1761.354,"Well, it assumes that --"
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.354,1769.945,And the 1915 (a) assumes the existence of a pauper who is not able to pay?
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1769.945,1785.601,"The rules did not assume an ability to pay initially, that is on the show that you are a pauper in order to get this benefit of installment payments, and I think Congress clearly -- it would be somewhat silly for Congress to say you have to show you are a pauper before you could get --"
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.601,1790.217,"It's not a first time that Congress has done a silly thing, would it?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1790.217,1814.025,"No, it wouldn't, but it would in any event seem somewhat silly for Congress to say that you have to file a -- you have to make a statement of indigency before you can get benefit of an installment payment, and then on the other hand contemplate that a general in forma pauperis statute would apply, you wouldn't have to do anything except file the petition and the affidavit of indigency."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1814.025,1818.591,"How broadly has 1915 (a) been applied in the district courts, do you know?"
1972.71-749,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1825.113,1839.043,"I think it has been applied broadly except in this area where the -- all of the lower courts, almost -- I don't know the decision the other way, have held that the general in forma pauperis statute is inapplicable here."
1972.71-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.043,1840.657,Thank you.
1972.71-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.657,1848.332,Mr. Finkel.
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,1848.332,1852.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.779,1969.459,"Well, isn’t he emancipated when the injunction has entered, at the filing of the petition?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,1969.459,1970.154,"But, Your Honor --"
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1970.154,1973.551,For all on the pragmatic aspect that you’re now sending to us?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,1973.551,1991.363,"Well, as a practical manner perhaps, but I would like to point out at the outset that this individual would not have been allowed to file his petition, but for the district court declaring it unconstitutional, because there was no way for Mr. Kras to promise that he would be able to pay in six months, $40.00 or $50.00."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2001.73,2017.89,"Would you assume or do you know whether some bankruptcy petitioners file their petition and file a statement that they will pay $1.00 a week or some such thing, and then in fact not be able to live up to that?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2017.89,2032.428,"Yeah, there are situations where perhaps that has happened, but in this particular case and many other cases that we represent clients, they cannot make that promise, and there is an initial fees of $10.00 that they also do not have, that has to be paid immediately."
1972.71-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.428,2037.416,"But more accurately, I suppose what you mean is they can’t make the promise with any reasonable expectation of performing?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2037.416,2038.533,"Well, they don’t know."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.952,2091.815,And the discharge won’t decide whether or not he was a thief or has any bearing on it?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2091.815,2105.049,"Well, it will in one sense, because if the insurance company had any evidence whatsoever that he committed a fraud, that debt would survive the discharge and bankruptcy, and therefore had they come into the bankruptcy court and prove their claim, that debt would have survived."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2109.438,2112.623,How much was involved in the lost premiums?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2112.623,2115.732,$1016.00.
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2115.732,2126.126,And you suppose the Metropolitan Life is going to pursue a man after the injunction and treat him as an ordinary debtor in these circumstances?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2126.126,2130.104,"Well, I have no way of knowing what Metropolitan will do, but it wouldn’t be surprising --"
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2130.104,2136.906,"Well, the generality of creditors don’t waste their time on such claims with people of that kind, isn't that true?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2136.906,2152.601,"I would say no Your Honor, it's not because the majority of bankruptcies that we have today are individuals and that's the reason there is a huge financial deficit in the system, are individuals with income with less than $4,000.00 who are subjected to creditor harassment and creditors do go after them and to judgments."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.958,2288.763,What was the nature of his employment?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2288.763,2295.078,"He was a salesman for the insurance company, and after that he was only able to find odd jobs, equaling about $600.00."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2295.078,2300.299,"Except for this psychiatric overlay or his psychological overlay, is he able bodied?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2300.299,2301.9,Yes.
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2301.9,2304.199,Does the record show whether he has tried to get employment?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2304.199,2315.747,"Yes, the record indicates the petitioner -- that he has applied not only within New York City, but he has gone outside the city to seek employment, and the bad references of Metropolitan he claims has followed him outside New York City."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2315.747,2317.985,"That's going to follow him after bankruptcy anyway, isn't it?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2317.985,2334.226,"Yes, it probably will follow him, but once discharged, then I think he has a better chance of bringing a civil action against them and he has a better chance of explaining it to an employer that Metropolitan didn’t see fit to come into court and protect that interest and really prove their case that maybe it's a false accusation, I don't know."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2334.226,2337.447,Do you feel that an employer will be impressed with that approach?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2337.447,2349.424,"I think it may, I just don’t know, but I think it has -- I think personally his personal sense of vindication, that's very important, will have an impact on his ability to proceed and obtain employment."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2349.424,2351.786,"What you are arguing is psychology, isn't it?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2351.786,2362.922,"No, Your Honor, I am arguing that the individual is -- there is a procedural bar in an individual statutory discharge, and that procedural bar violates his constitutional right to be heard and has to be struck down."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2386.638,2390.54,"As I recall, the fee in Boddie was higher than the fee here?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2390.54,2391.375,It was a little higher.
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2392.786,2395.363,"You say if it’s reasonable in Boddie, then it is reasonable here?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2395.363,2395.993,"No, it’s not."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2430.737,2444.517,Have you given any though to whether or not this Court in a general order could solve this situation as authorized by Congress?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2444.517,2448.911,"I gave it a thought about 20 minutes ago, Your Honor, when you asked that question.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2474.574,2476.701,"While I interrupted you, I am curious."
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2479.537,2481.578,Yes.
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.578,2485.521,"I was just curious, you have a very nicely credit brief here and I wondered --"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2485.521,2485.755,Yes.
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2485.755,2487.568,-- where the money came to print that?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2487.568,2490.499,It comes with the United States Supreme Court.
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.367,2495.374,Alright.[Attempt to Laughter]
1972.71-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.374,2501.771,Do you attack the District Judge's indication that the fee may be collected later?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2501.771,2507.214,"No, Your Honor, we don’t know where his authority is, but we have no trouble with it, because as long as the --"
1972.71-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.214,2509.682,So he comes out of bankruptcy with this debt?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2509.682,2517.42,"He comes out with this debt and he comes out with the debt to the Federal Government of $150.00 in taxes and a few other debts, but he comes out with a complete discharge."
1972.71-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.42,2519.344,Whatever a discharge covers his debt?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2519.344,2519.596,Right.
1972.71-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.596,2523.332,But it doesn’t cover this debt?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2523.332,2533.785,"We didn’t object to that part of the order that was inserted, and we have no -- we didn’t object to it upon consideration, we might in the future, but as of now we have accepted that."
1972.71-749,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2536.945,2551.404,"Mr. Finkel, one another question, does your argument to carry us logically to the conclusion that there should be no fees, maybe no fees constitutionally imposed in every or any asset-less estate?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2551.404,2571.336,"Your Honor, I would say that taking Boddie, this case can be distinguished from all filing fee cases and come within Boddie, because this individual although it’s not an absolute monopoly, the state has interposed a statutory scheme and there are no realistic alternatives for Mr. Kras."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.34,2758.861,"Mr. Finkel, you have emphasized now in this last -- the recent observation, at least three or four times, the initial access, the barrier to initial access."
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2762.298,2762.865,"Yes, there is."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.978,2775.811,"But, he is in court, he is in court and has access when he signs that affidavit, isn’t he?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2775.811,2780.316,"He is in court, when he signs that affidavit, that will be totally meaningless on the empty promise --"
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.316,2784.104,"Now, that's meaningless, but you really haven’t denied in access."
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2800.512,2810.534,"Well, Your Honor I define access to mean that the individual is in court and the relief he seeks he can obtain without any financial barriers."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2829.893,2842.218,"Well, isn’t a history of it in fact though that most indigent applications petitioners in bankruptcy do sign the affidavit now, the overwhelming majority of them?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2842.218,2845.233,"No, Your Honor, we don’t know and I checked with our law offices."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2870.884,2879.617,"Well, isn’t there a fact that the deficit that has being incurred or resulted the non-payment about people who have promised to pay?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2879.617,2880.632,I would say no Your Honor.
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2889.388,2891.438,You do not think that factor contributes to that deficit?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2891.438,2896.772,"Contributes, but negligible and not to override the individual's right to be there."
1972.71-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.251,2928.748,Mr. Finkel?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2928.748,2929.199,Yes sir.
1972.71-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.199,2944.292,Would you agree that your client probably cannot force Metropolitan to come in and defend the merits of its acquisitions against him in a bankruptcy court.
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2960.027,2960.738,Absolutely not.
1972.71-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.839,2997.695,"But, it is not an adjudication on the merits?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,2997.695,3002.872,"No, it’s not an adjudication on merits, except that it has been discharged and they didn’t come into prove fraud."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.097,3010.944,"At least in your brief, there is any reliance at all of the statute."
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3010.944,3012.489,"Well, in the lower court, we did Your Honor."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.831,3016.676,And they turn the -- the lower court turned it out.
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3016.676,3020.043,We feel that 1915 is very broadly construed.
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3030.335,3041.14,"The statute came earlier, I know that forma pauperis statute goes away back, but -- there was a bankruptcy law back in the early 18th or 19th Century?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3041.14,3064.306,"But at the time they abolished forma pauperis for bankruptcy in 1946 or 1948, there already was 1915 on the books and they past what would the installing fees which all lower courts have considered it and we thought they were right, held that that covered the point and therefore bankruptcy is not within 1915."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3064.306,3068.409,You are in a better position and I know this.
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3075.204,3081.727,"Yes, other than the bankruptcy discharge, I know of no other federal filing fee that doesn’t come within 1915."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3081.727,3082.784,Both as a plaintiff as defendant?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3082.784,3087.684,"Both as plaintiff as defendant on appeal, both civil and criminally."
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.684,3088.789,In any kind of proceeding?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3088.789,3089.814,Any kins of --
1972.71-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3089.814,3091.058,And attainable in the federal court?
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3091.058,3092.142,Yes.
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.796,3126.393,"Have you referred in your brief Mr. Finkel to any of the studies made, comparative studies made of filing fees, generally tracing the development from the time when the filling fee was – and the filing fees and aggregate were really important of the support of the court system down to the present date where it's negligible chiefly because the fees have remained static in a period of rising costs."
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3127.481,3129.133,"No, we don't have any of that in the brief."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.299,3178.573,"I suppose as a matter of common knowledge, a $50.00 filing fee might have supported a particular clerk’s office 50 or 100 years ago and wouldn’t pay for the lights under present conditions?"
1972.71-749,1,33819,kalman_finkel,,3178.573,3186.115,"Today, the bankruptcy deficit is so enormous, I would say that it was negligible the relationship to the $50 fee."
1972.71-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3209.139,3211.114,"Thank Mr. Finkel, thank you Mr. Korman."
