1974.73-1471,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,0.0,63.819,"73-1471, United States v. New Jersey State Lottery Commission."
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,87.286,91.858,Thank you Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.78,369.579,Wasn't this statute aimed at illegal lotteries?
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,372.002,381.329,Well Mr. Justice that the question was addressed by the Second Circuit and by the Commission and we've discussed it in our brief.
1974.73-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.41,384.691,There was no such thing as illegal lottery at the time of the enactment?
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,384.691,386.928,At the time of the enactment of this particular --
1974.73-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.928,387.512,"So, all lotteries are illegal?"
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,387.512,409.121,"-- statute, but this statute is one in the series of anti-lottery statutes that Congress enacted foreclosing the channels of interstate commerce and the channels of communication regulated by Congress to the promotion of lotteries including the use of the mails."
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,413.356,416.473,"Well, it doesn't go because it's gambling, does it?"
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,416.473,423.968,The 19th Century statutes were enacted at a time when there were legally authorized lotteries in the United States.
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,423.968,438.24,"What's striking as funny is that you can't broadcast result of the lottery, but you can broadcast the result of a horse race, including the odds?"
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,438.24,442.403,That it's true under the Commission's ruling.
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.313,452.582,And the Commission doesn't propose anything beyond that?
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,452.582,453.872,The Commission does not.
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,489.286,495.471,Do you think anybody would listen to horse race results who didn't bet?
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,495.471,499.161,"Well, I know people attend races and don't bet."
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.161,500.451,You do?
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,500.451,508.765,I have done so.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.455,536.702,"Well, we don't have to decide whether or not Congress could do it, the point is that Congress has singled out lottery?"
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,536.702,538.3,It has singled out lotteries.
1974.73-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,538.3,538.8,And that's it.
1974.73-1471,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,538.8,545.804,And it deliberately did so in the course of the development of this legislation in the 19th Century.
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1488.405,1492.451,Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.223,1592.89,"On the other hand, could the -- could the Congress validly prohibit the station from itself conducting a lottery over the airwaves?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1592.89,1617.197,"I would think Your Honor that it could, although that even -- the response to that question may have been confused somewhat by the passage of time and the widespread circumstances under which other types of gambling operations are at least advertised on radio and television, but I think despite that the changes that have occurred in the last few years, the answer today is probably still yes whether --"
1974.73-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.197,1628.302,"And if it were found here and validly so that the station was actually participating in the conduct of a lottery, would you have the same result?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1628.302,1648.121,I think that would be a far different case if the lottery were -- if the station were participant in the lottery as distinguished from exercising editorial judgment and seeking to meet a public demand for information that would be a far different case from the one that that is in fact before the Court.
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.121,1656.353,What if the only place you could get information as to the lottery winning number was over the radio?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1656.353,1659.377,I would be inclined that in fact is not true.
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.871,1662.045,But what if it were?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1662.045,1666.831,That of anything might exacerbate the First Amendment problem.
1974.73-1471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1932.063,1939.243,"Getting back, Mr. Skillman, are you suggesting that there's no legal lotteries when this was -- the statute was adopted?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1952.265,1957.633,"We are not taking the position, Your Honor that 1304 does not apply to legal lotteries."
1974.73-1471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.569,1992.647,"Well, the reason I asked, I notice that your brief at page 12 has a sentence accordingly Section 1304 should be construed so as to avoid these substantial constitutional policy, citing Machinist and (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,1992.647,2001.895,The substantial constitutional problems to which we avert are the basic free speech and free press problems.
1974.73-1471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.895,2008.058,"Oh, I know but we could constitute 1304 as not including legal lotteries, obviously we wouldn't have to reach the --"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2008.058,2022.99,I think that if you could do that that would avoid the First Amendment problems but I would have some difficulty urging to the Court that it should reach that conclusion in light of the legislative history.
1974.73-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.433,2040.837,"What do you -- how do you suggest that we construe 1304, to exclude what?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2040.837,2048.913,To exclude winning lottery numbers that are broadcast as part of the regular news show.
1974.73-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.231,2053.52,Whether the lottery is legal or illegal?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2053.52,2057.074,That would not matter.
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.025,2119.623,"They don't give you telephone numbers then, do they?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2119.623,2138.772,"They do, Your Honor indicate where legal prostitution or illegal prostitution takes place which may be even more helpful information for an interested party than the type of information that the State of New Jersey is -- that the broadcasters are providing --"
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.772,2143.711,What if lotteries were illegal in New Jersey?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2155.794,2156.761,If they were illegal --
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.761,2158.19,If they were illegal?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2158.19,2164.684,"I think we would still have First Amendment problems, Your Honor, but it would certainly be a much more difficult case."
1974.73-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.629,2290.54,"But you represent the state of New Jersey, don't you?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2290.54,2291.806,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.806,2295.014,And doesn't the state have a commercial interest in it?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2295.014,2300.331,I think the state does have a commercial interest although I might say that the --
1974.73-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.331,2301.274,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2301.274,2317.106,"That the commercial interest here is in producing revenue for education and for public institution so perhaps it's a commercial interest of a different dimension than that what is involved in the other commercial speech cases, but the First Amendment interest --"
1974.73-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.106,2339.07,Would this be a different case you supposed if the facts were these that you had offered to pay the broadcasting company so much per spot announcement of the winning number every Thursday and it had expressed the willingness to accept your offer and had gone then.
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2345.225,2346.195,That would be a totally different case.
1974.73-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.195,2347.162,It would be totally a different case --
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2347.162,2352.957,"First of all, we'd be clearly under 1304 because 1304 mentions advertisement and I think that kind of a promotion --"
1974.73-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.957,2355.926,"Yes, yes, but would you -- would be a different case constitutionally?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2355.926,2361.924,"Constitutionally, I think that we would be within the realm of the commercial speech doctrine."
1974.73-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.426,2406.245,"Well the Court's opinion in Pittsburg Press didn't speak in terms of an overwhelming or compelling state demand, did it?"
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2408.501,2437.733,"It did not speak in that terms Your Honor because it found the speech to be commercial speech. In that sense, perhaps, I did misspeak myself in responding to Mr. Justice Stewart, but in this context, once we get away from commercial speech and to news broadcasting, clearly a compelling or overwhelming public interest is required to sustain any type of restriction upon the press."
1974.73-1471,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2437.733,2456.575,"Mr. Skillman, I think I am bothered a little too because I sense from your remarks that the public interest is a definite factor in news, information becomes news because there is public interest in it, I think this is what you're sayin."
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2472.841,2501.379,I think that that might depend on a factual inquiry as to whether the broadcast were made by the broadcaster as an accommodation to the group that was holding the raffle in which event one might not classify this as news or whether the broadcaster came to the conclusion that's editorial judgment that there were sufficient public interest in the information that wholly apart from any accommodation to the person holding the raffle.
1974.73-1471,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2521.989,2527.121,"Let me ask one more question, while I have you interrupted."
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2538.59,2555.579,"No, I think conceptually if the broadcast news media comes to the conclusion of the names of winners are news worthy and certainly there have been front page newspaper stories and television features in New Jersey about the winners of the millionaire lottery."
1974.73-1471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2570.636,2574.457,Even though there's the information concerning any lottery?
1974.73-1471,1,42073,stephen_skillman,,2574.457,2593.925,"That's correct, if on a very technical literal analysis it would be information concerning a lottery and I think that's the reason that even the FCC concedes that a literal analysis or a literal construction of 1304 would not be inappropriate -- excuse me, would not be appropriate."
1974.73-1471,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2798.817,2801.79,"I believe you have six minutes left, Mr. Wallace."
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2801.79,2803.147,Alright.
1974.73-1471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2825.429,2830.603,"Mr. Wallace, what about the interview with the millionaire winner?"
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2830.603,2870.791,"That is not barred by 1304 under the Commission's view spelled out under remand in the New York state broadcasters and that's on page 849 of 21 FCC II, paragraph 11 deals with interviews, with persons holding winning lottery tickets, relating among other matters of general interests of the number of tickets they purchased, their expectation of winning a prize, their reaction upon learning that they held winning tickets and what they did or intend to do with the prize money."
1974.73-1471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.791,2873.05,"Well, it is information concerning a lottery?"
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2873.05,2873.417,Yes.
1974.73-1471,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2873.417,2875.211,What page number was that?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2875.211,2880.086,That's on page 849 of 21 FCC II.
1974.73-1471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.567,2885.614,And what's the distinction?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2885.614,2900.938,"Well, the Commission in the Second Circuit said that the word information has to be interpreted narrowly to apply only to information directly promoting a lottery and not to interview his commentary documentary --"
1974.73-1471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.938,2905.741,"What I'm asking, I can't imagine a better promotion than interviewing someone who's won a million dollars?"
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2905.741,2909.309,"Well, it's not hawking."
1974.73-1471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2912.488,2916.341,I bet you know a lot of people run out and buy them in consequence?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2916.341,2935.39,"Well, the same thing, people might be encouraged to buy tickets by a news program about aid to education that has resulted from lottery receipts and so forth but these are all considered matters of legitimate news interests that are not primarily promotions of the lottery."
1974.73-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.39,2952.299,The publications promote an activity the Congress has the constitutional power as prescribed then constitutionality -- and it's also within the coverage of personal holding?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2952.299,2965.786,"Yes, that Congress has the power to deny the use of the mails or of the broadcast media to promote activities that Congress believes are injurious to the public and --"
1974.73-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.786,2966.951,But constitutionally --
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2966.951,2975.012,That -- thought that was a much of what holding was in the Capital Broadcasting case with regard to cigarette advertising.
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2989.236,2997.209,"Mr. Wallace, you can have the story and the pictures of all the men winning the million dollars, that's okay."
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2997.299,2999.941,That is the Commission's -- that is the Commission's interpretation of 1304.
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.941,3005.344,Could you announce the number of the winning ticket on that program?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3006.238,3007.406,"Well, --"
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.406,3008.139,No.
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3008.139,3010.106,The Commission hasn't spoken to that.
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.647,3012.628,"Well, the Commission you said that you can't announce the number?"
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3012.628,3015.735,"The Commission has -- yes, well, --"
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.735,3015.876,They can --
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3015.876,3030.178,But the Commission dealt within this case is a proposal that the number be announced weekly at the time of the drawing on a newscast so that someone buying a lottery ticket would know that he could tune in next Thursday and know whether he held --
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.178,3030.43,And that is more encouraging --
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3030.43,3037.321,-- the winning ticket or not and that's a different case from a public interest interview which the Commission really hasn't spoken to.
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.321,3045.617,"But before this, that encourages lottery play and more so then tell somebody that they won?"
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3045.617,3046.275,"Yes, well, --"
1974.73-1471,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3046.275,3048.103,I could then say the government said this?
1974.73-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3048.103,3062.869,"Because, well, our -- many people think that the lottery statute are outmoded insofar as they apply to legal state's sponsored lotteries and that question is pending before a Congress."
1974.73-1471,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3216.645,3217.419,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
