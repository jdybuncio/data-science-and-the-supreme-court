1965.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.814,"Number 5 Fred L. Shuttlesworth, petitioner, versus City of Birmingham."
1965.5,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,37.834,41.269,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.5,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,109.011,114.044,[Inaudible] put on the offense?
1965.5,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,114.044,118.975,There were two ordinances mentioned in the complaint.
1965.5,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,127.297,130.36,"So we got -- this sentence is the maximum then, is it?"
1965.5,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,130.36,136.609,The maximum that you could get for one offense.
1965.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,407.849,410.503,He didn't know him or didn't recognize him or both?
1965.5,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,410.503,418.418,"He says both, he said he didn't know – said seen him on television."
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3071.945,3076.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.5,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3222.452,3234.911,"What if the -- what is the crime on the Alabama statute, if every one but Shuttlesworth or everyone in the group, but one moved on and one man stayed on behind --"
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3234.911,3255.227,"Mr. Justice Douglas, we contend in this case, that the proscription reads any person who as a part -- as a person or a member of a group, in other words some of the statutes or ordinances are phrased in a group as such, but this includes person as well."
1965.5,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3255.227,3256.373,Yes.
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3264.356,3273.737,"That maybe a question if he remained, so and does not block, but however though I think the evidence is clear that they didn't all move."
1965.5,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3327.47,3328.511,Which officer was that?
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3328.511,3329.974,That is Officer Byars.
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.769,3383.463,Mr. McBee?
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3383.463,3385.823,Yes Sir.
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.823,3395.068,Was the defendant convicted of obstructing the sidewalk or of refusing to obey the command of the officer --
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3395.068,3405.767,"It -- the Court of Appeals, I think very clearly indicated what the conviction was for."
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.968,3430.755,At the same time?
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3430.755,3432.057,"At the same time, yes sir."
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.057,3440.489,"So, would you say to sustain this conviction you would have to have sufficient evidence in the record, if they were both blocking at the sidewalk and the refusal to obey at the time?"
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3440.489,3442.137,"Yes sir, I think that is true."
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.137,3462.157,"Now, what evidence in the record is there that when Shuttlesworth refused to move at the officer's request that at that time, as well as, before when he was a member of the group, that there was any blocking of the sidewalk?"
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3462.157,3475.928,"Well, the evidence was that the group substantially remained, the officer watched, the officer watched the witness to be -- standing -- the group standing --"
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.928,3480.221,"When he was first requested to move, not when he was last requested, when he was first requested to move, there was a group there."
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3480.221,3484.985,"When he was first requested to move, that the group was still there and nobody moved."
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.985,3486.428,"And he did not move with the rest of them, not –"
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3486.428,3487.536,Nobody moved at that time.
1965.5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.536,3490.326,Is that when you said there was a coincidence of the evidence of --
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3490.326,3495.499,"Yes sir they, in other words, when he first came up, he requested them to move."
1965.5,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3540.624,3545.009,Where do we find that in the testimony that no one had moved at that time?
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3545.009,3554.742,"That -- that was the testimony of Officer Byars, and I believe also of Officer Holman --"
1965.5,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3554.742,3557.016,Where -- where do we find it in the record?
1965.5,1,22791,earl_mcbee,,3557.016,3558.777,They are to be found --
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,6933.558,6936.861,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7205.684,7206.123,How wide?
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7206.123,7208.482,"It's around 20 feet wide, the length of that block."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7208.482,7209.382,That's the one they were on?
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7209.382,7215.517,"That's the -- the 19 Street side, the Street they had been walking down and the -- it was Second Street --"
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7215.517,7223.174,"Were they -- were they at the time of the crowd was assembled, were they on the 12th Street side or the 22 foot side?"
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7223.174,7227.378,"They were at the intersection of these two, of these two street sidewalks."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7227.378,7228.868,By the street on the --?
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7228.868,7235.694,"Yes, somewhere on that intersection, I do not know very clear."
1965.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7264.418,7271.251,"I know if it is the original starts with a $100, because they paid a $100 fine."
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7271.251,7281.353,"I believe Your Honor, that the sentence in the Recorder's Court was also 180 days and a $100 fine, and --"
1965.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7281.353,7286.82,"Is that in the Recorder – that's the maximum they can give this one, take out the --"
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7286.82,7289.287,As a matter of both counts.
1965.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7289.287,7294.872,"$100 and a 180 days, six months."
1965.5,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7294.872,7319.493,"On page 11, they said, you hereby fined a sum of $100 and plus and a new paragraph that said [Inaudible] fail to pay this fine of $100 and it costs $5 or confess judgment for goodness based on security is therefore considered by the court [Inaudible] law and then the defendant Shuttlesworth perform hard labor."
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7319.493,7328.216,"Mr. Justice Clark, the final, the sense in the recorded score as indicated on Page 2, the, this is the --"
1965.5,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7328.216,7334.247,This is the trial de novo here which sentence is in effect.
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7334.247,7336.452,"The second one, the one you were looking at."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7346.681,7354.254,"And because he did not pay the $100 -- $100 fine, it was 52 days more, isn't that right?"
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7354.254,7359.367,"I am unable to ascertain whether -- whether there are two $100 fines, I do not think so, I hope say."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7359.367,7359.702,"No, No."
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7363.03,7364.974,"If you do not pay the fine, you get the 2 months more."
1965.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7364.974,7380.032,"Yes, and having not already determined that because he has not paid the fine, then he has to serve 52 days at $0.75 a day."
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7380.032,7389.124,"I confess by the inaccuracy in understanding the Alabama judgment, it says that and then it says all confessed judgment with good sufficient cause, I just do not know what that mean."
1965.5,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7389.124,7403.068,"My question is when he -- if we were to affirm the case, if he paid a $100 would it be ending or would he have pay to serve the 52 days?"
1965.5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7403.068,7403.955,I could pay it.
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7403.955,7404.848,I think he could pay.
1965.5,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7404.848,7410.329,"All it had to do was just pay $100 and the case would be, trial would be --?"
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7410.329,7411.461,He still has to serve 6 months.
1965.5,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7411.461,7414.796,52 days for fine if he could pay that.
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7414.796,7415.109,Yes.
1965.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7415.109,7429.633,"What you have as the same thing you have all over the country and that if a man is convicted by these fines, he does not pay the fine, he is sentenced to a certain amount of imprisonment."
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7440.014,7449.425,Yes.
1965.5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7479.86,7493.657,"Mr. Nabrit did you ever press you objections, or press your point of the evidence that you offered was exclusion [Inaudible] constitutional term --"
1965.5,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,7493.657,7494.806,Not to my knowledge.
1965.5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7494.806,7497.165,And you did not bring that point here again.
1965.5,3,22791,earl_mcbee,,7497.165,7499.804,It's not in the petition for certiorari.
1965.5,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7499.804,7510.772,Very well.
