1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.83,We will here arguments next in Landmark Communications against Virginia.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,29.255,31.946,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,87.356,92.643,You characterized in this charges is not the process one of inquiry.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,92.643,93.397,"Yes, I did."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,102.99,105.456,So charges are complaints from --
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,105.456,106.456,Yes.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,106.456,110.173,-- various miscellaneous sources but not from any official source in this regard.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,110.173,110.962,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,110.962,113.112,Or a criminal charge.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,113.112,114.946,That is correct.
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.088,267.222,Mr. Abrams is there anything in the record of which we may properly take cognizance of how Landmark learned of the facts that have published?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,267.222,271.563,"No, there is nothing in the record whatsoever."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.106,278.776,"I suppose only the editor of the paper knows that, would that be a reasonable assumption?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,278.776,283.359,I think it is a reasonable that the editor and the journalist involved and know that.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,283.359,286.118,"And perhaps some others, but those two, of course, must know about it."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,286.118,289.081,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.33,327.802,"Mr. Abrams, under your reading of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion, do you think the statute would apply you if you told us the name of the judge?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,332.558,340.985,"Mr. Justice Stevens I think it would unless there were some other privilege which protected me, because I was in this courtroom I have a little doubt that --"
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.985,341.72,The statute --
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,341.72,357.418,"That it would apply to me if I were to walk outside and provide the name of the judge with one carrier that this Court has decided, of course, that once papers are public we filed in a court the press may print with impunity what is contained in them."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.107,450.866,"How would the statute apply differently, would it apply to the person who released the information?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,450.866,453.103,It would apply to the person who released the information.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,453.103,456.25,(Inaudible) he or she would be guilty of the same crime.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,456.25,457.426,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.426,459.782,Giving the purpose of the Chairman of the Commission.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,459.782,463.206,"Indeed, if there is no --"
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,463.206,467.674,Or a member of the Supreme Court of the State of Virginia or the Commonwealth of Virginia.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,467.674,482.436,"Yes Your Honor, there is no exception -- and I should point out in other respect that the Virginia Supreme Court had argued to it in various narrowing ways of reading the statute and did not adopt any narrowing ways of read it."
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.858,516.255,"Well, is your submission that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to anybody or just the press?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,516.255,524.56,"It is my submission today that it is unconstitutional, as applied to anyone who is not the party before the Commission."
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.893,552.856,"Well, let us assume -- so your argument is that even if it is holding constitutional to forbid the participants --"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,552.856,554.099,Yes sir.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.099,558.57,-- from disclosing anything that nevertheless is unconstitutional as apply to the press?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,558.57,559.348,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.348,564.784,Or all you need to argue is that it is unconstitutional as applied to your client in this case.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,564.784,580.65,"Yes, I would say that most of the arguments that I will make to you today would apply as well to someone that reads the newspaper and then repeats it to someone else, because the statute does go that far."
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.606,591.907,"But non in your argument would not question the underlying validity of the statute as applied to participants, is that it?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,591.907,594.011,"I have not gone that far Your Honor, that is correct."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,594.011,609.763,"And of course you need not as Justice Stewart suggested, but if the judge who is the subject of the inquiry, called a press conference and welcome this inquiry, and of course I will be vindicated swiftly as --"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,609.763,627.976,"Your Honor, it seems to me that the only way to read the statute is that the judge would have violated the provisions of the statute of the newspaper if it prints what the judge said would have violated, and any reader of the newspaper who repeats what the newspaper said would have violated."
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.919,683.305,Do you think your client’s protection is in anyway diminished by the fact that it is a corporation?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,683.305,687.484,I do not think so Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.547,710.512,Corporations and individuals stand on an equal footing.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,710.512,711.927,I would so argue Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.927,714.582,That is at least so far is the protection of the Press Clause.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,714.582,717.726,At least to cover the press.
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.314,736.493,Is there any reason to think that if it is so as to the press it is different be as to freedom of expression?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,736.493,748.977,"As a general matter Your Honor, it is seem to me that this case could be decided as a freedom of expression case without necessarily relying on the Press Clause itself."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.247,796.178,"You are not suggesting the First Amendment protection reaches only corporations which publish newspapers in any sense, I think."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,796.178,797.288,"No your honor, no your honor."
1977.76-1450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,969.27,975.662,"Of course, this is really not an old-fashioned First Amendment case because this is not the federal Government that is involved, is it?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,975.662,976.533,No it is not Federal Government.
1977.76-1450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.533,978.266,It is a Fourteenth Amendment case.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,978.266,980.886,"It is a First through the Fourteenth Amendment case, yes Your Honor."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.886,983.008,"Well, it is pretty old-fashioned right now, isn’t it?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,983.008,984.527,That is pretty old-fashioned to me.
1977.76-1450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.527,986.201,"Well, it is such a release."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,986.201,987.64,Yes.
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.822,1187.879,If it was public then anybody can use it.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1187.879,1191.523,"Yes sir, at that point it is public then anybody has full access to it."
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.284,1222.288,"But, I do not understand the argument Mr. Abrams, because if no charge is filed, wouldn’t the need for protection remain for the same period of time that the statute requires confidentiality?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1222.288,1223.594,"Well, if no charge is filed --"
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.594,1225.95,The judge may never even know about it.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1225.95,1229.39,It is possible that the judge may not know about it.
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1324.802,1337.576,"No, that is not entirely possible that if there were total confidentiality the judge never knew about but, then Commission decided there was no merit to a charge that was dismissed, he would never have any reason to retaliate against anyone."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1349.985,1358.791,"Mr. Justice Stevens that is possible, and I do not deny that the statute could have in this in other ways, the signatory effects."
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.467,1457.074,Why do you say this clear and present danger doctrine is not one which should commend itself to us generally?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1457.074,1468.957,"Well, it seems to me Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the doctrine has been eroded by a variety of decisions of this Court Brandenburg versus Ohio, being one of the more recent ones."
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.752,1522.2,Do you or would you adhere to your same position if we are talking about Justice Holmes’ initial formulation of it in Schenck?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1522.2,1534.188,"I would argue that if the Schenck case were here now and we did not have all the history that we have, the Court could have gone quite a bit farther than it did in Schenck itself."
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.742,1619.428,What would you say about this case if there was an argue -- if there were proof that this judge cannot function effectively if the name was disclosed right on either for trial or something.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1619.428,1629.626,"Justice Stevens I would say then that for the other reasons I asserted earlier that, that was a social price which the First Amendment requires astutely."
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.653,1639.083,What is your test?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1659.778,1685.965,"But, what I would suggest is the first of all, the way the Court ought to approach such issue is to try to do so far as it is possible in terms of categories of speech which are or might are not protected speech and then deal with the question of what kind of test to apply to speech or expression which mat not be protected."
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.558,1719.343,"Well, then you disagree with that part of the Schenck case which talks about a substantive evil which the Government has a right to prevent."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1719.343,1724.102,I think that that has been much eroded through the years Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.599,1745.342,Was there a Court opinion in Elrod?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1745.342,1754.995,"There was not a Court opinion in Elrod, but there was a Court opinion in the Buckley case, which used very similar language as to that."
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1782.324,1787.941,Mr. Abrams did the state at any time relied on the clear and present danger doctrine?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1787.941,1789.07,Did the state do what sir?
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.07,1791.619,Rely on that in this case.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1791.619,1801.951,"The state did -- let me say this Mr. Justice Marshall, both sides argued in part on the basis of the clear and present danger doctrine."
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1815.543,1820.791,My question was what did the state show about clear and present danger?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1820.791,1822.74,The state showed nothing.
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.788,1827.262,We have it here.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1827.262,1827.842,Sorry.
1977.76-1450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1827.842,1829.725,How about -- how do we have it here?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1829.725,1839.928,"All that you have is the stipulation of evidence, there was stipulation of evidence which was no more than that the article was printed by Landmark and that that was what it said."
1977.76-1450,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1847.191,1849.837,But the Supreme Court of Virginia did make that finding?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1849.837,1850.499,"Yes, your honor."
1977.76-1450,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1851.039,1863.613,"And basted it on the legislative history and the obvious purpose of legislation, the general background, there was no evidence produced at trial."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1863.613,1874.654,The Supreme Court of Virginia made a finding that sanctions were indispensable to the prevention of the loss of confidentiality.
1977.76-1450,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1874.654,1878.093,And the purpose was to protect the administration of justice.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1878.093,1878.612,Yes sir.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1894.454,1901.51,Would it be fair to say that they have indulged in a presumption that that was the reason the legislature enacted the statute.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1901.51,1904.856,I think that is very fair to say Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.856,1914.33,Mr. Abrams are there laws the country against the publication of grand jury proceeding?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1914.33,1916.91,I believe there is some such laws your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.701,1927.512,But there are state laws against the press publishing confidential information from grand juries?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1927.512,1928.208,There maybe.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.262,1941.726,But anyway I would take it that situation would be involved in the decision of this case.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1941.726,1942.982,It could be Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.809,1960.899,It would be about the same.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1960.899,1972.742,That a law which made it a crime to print a leak from a grand jury would be unconstitutional for some of the same reasons that we urge upon you on this case.
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.742,1988.816,"Isn’t there a difference in that grand jury is concerned exclusively with criminal conduct whereas a Commission of this kind is inquiring into fitness of duty, is that an important difference?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1988.816,1991.661,"Yes, that is one very relevant difference."
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.661,1994.066,"Which way does it cut, Mr. Abrams?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1994.066,2002.287,"Well, I think it would cut at least in the favor of us in this case and make the grand jury case, if anything, a little bit harder."
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.83,2019.703,Wouldn’t’ you think it would be hard for you to win this case or lose the grand jury case?
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2019.703,2020.684,I hope so Your Honor.
1977.76-1450,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.684,2021.29,Now you hope --
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2021.29,2026.308,"I think so, but one really could distinguish it."
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.371,2065.708,I do not quite see why you responded to the Chief Justice and Justice White’s question that the difference in the nature of the Commission as opposed to grand jury cuts in your favor rather than the other one.
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2065.708,2074.351,To the extent what is involved in the Commission is a determination of the fitness of public officials for their public service.
1977.76-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.498,2092.29,"Well, what about the facts presented to a grand jury that say a high public official or a well-known private businessman is guilty of a crime?"
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2092.29,2099.526,"Your Honor, the fact the President Nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator was printed in the press."
1977.76-1450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.159,2155.175,"Well, isn’t it also true, you made also the argument that that sort of publication might implicate interest in the fair trail of the person being investigated before the grand jury."
1977.76-1450,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2158.581,2163.498,"Absolutely, that is the of course one of the main reasons in favor of grand jury secrecy."
1977.76-1450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2169.188,2172.917,Mr. Kulp.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2172.917,2177.821,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.011,2467.415,How many of them have stature comparable to Virginia’s on the disclosure aspect?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2467.415,2475.485,"I think Mr. Chief Justice to answer your question first, each of the 42 require confidentiality."
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.932,2501.205,A felony on the disclosure in terms of the internal function or on the publisher of the disclosed material?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2501.205,2507.677,"Well, I have to say I think it is both but we really do not have a cage which has construed that."
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.914,2536.631,What would you think if the judge who was under inquiry out at press conference said he you welcomed the inquiry and he was sure it would be vindicated and --
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2536.631,2545.988,"Mr. Chief Justice I believe that the question, some or that was answered by the State of California in McCarthy versus the Commission."
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2607.097,2618.476,"Would this one of your reasons for justification of this stature that this confidentiality is not guaranteed with witnesses, complainants will not come forward?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2618.476,2623.954,If it please the Court Mr. Chief Justice I do not think there is any question about that.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.666,2710.537,"Mr. Kulp, you are talking about confidentiality or criminal prosecution when we say that you cannot do it and that these witnesses insist of, what do they insist of, confidentiality or the prosecution of the newspaper?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2710.537,2716.714,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Marshall that what they are asking for is confidentiality,."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2716.714,2719.313,And that is not involved in this case.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2719.313,2723.786,"No sir, well, I think it is to a great extent, because the fact is --"
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.786,2726.546,That this raises a criminal prosecution.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2726.546,2727.095,That is right sir.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.095,2730.475,And that is a little different from confidentiality.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2730.475,2731.289,"We have it, if it please --"
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.289,2734.453,"It is a little step forward, isn’t it?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2734.453,2736.227,"Well, we do not think so."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.227,2737.521,Or backward then?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2737.521,2743.015,"No sir, I think that it is a necessary measure I think that it is found by the Supreme Court."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.015,2749.455,"I know but, Mr. Kulp my only point is, am I correct that Virginia is the only state that has this criminal provision other than Hawaii?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2749.455,2751.716,"No sir, the State of Hawaii had, yes sir."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.716,2753.077,That is the only two.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2753.077,2753.865,And there are three of them --
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.865,2759.954,So any broad statements you make about the other 48 states is just not true?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2759.954,2771.533,I never said that except for the fact that they feel that the foundation for the Commission itself must be in rest around confidentiality.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2797.038,2803.928,"Well, is there any confidentiality when you are investigating a member of the General Assembly in Virginia?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2803.928,2805.062,No sir I think that --
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.062,2810.387,"Well, is there any confidentiality in any other branches of the government other than judges?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2810.387,2811.185,"No sir, but I think we have --"
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.185,2814.244,Why is a judge entitled to that special treatment?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2814.244,2818.344,"I do not think it is just the judge, that is not what the Supreme Court Virginia said."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.344,2820.525,"Well, who else is covered by this?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2820.525,2825.736,"I think only -- their allegations made only against judges, I think with that --"
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.736,2833.977,"That is what I was saying, well, why is that particular phase of government deserving of this special protection?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2838.051,2848.755,I think that because of the fact that I think you have a different between the administration of justice which the Supreme Court of Virginia found as the reason on the one hand.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2958.901,2962.352,Which would never be released under normal effects of that?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2962.352,2964.84,That is correct.
1977.76-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.295,3059.669,"Mr. Kulp, isn’t it another very important reason for confidentiality that you want to be able to persuade the judge to resign before the matter becomes public?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3059.669,3062.886,I do not think there is any question about that Mr. Justice Stevens.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.9,3205.575,"I am not sure you have made the point but isn’t one of your strong points that purpose of the legislature is to try to encourage people to come forward and to give evidence against unfit judges and make complaints against them, and that the protection of the judge is something of parallel consideration."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3205.575,3208.653,Indeed is Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3228.699,3237.505,What provisions do you have in the Commonwealth of Virginia for the disqualification of the judge in the motion of the counsel?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3237.505,3240.957,We do have that but of course that is at his discretion.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3240.957,3242.391,The discretion of the judge or something.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3242.391,3261.153,"The discretion of the judge, yes sir, and of course I assume we could if he refuses to recuse himself that you could file a petition for mandamus but of course there you are faced with a situation of whether it has been arbitrary and capricious action on his part."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3261.153,3268.214,"Mr. Kulp, am I correct that the other side does not object to the confidentiality of it at all?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3268.214,3269.827,I am sorry Mr. Justice Marshall I am not sure.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3269.827,3277.304,Am I not correct that the petitioner does not object to the confidentiality of the law?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3282.204,3284.906,"I would say that is their position, yes sir."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3284.906,3288.144,So the confidentiality is out of it?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3288.144,3292.803,I could not agree with that sir because I think it has to be all taken together.
1977.76-1450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.892,3341.473,"Well it is not far away from the New York Times case, not the Sullivan’s case but the Pentagon Papers case except that this does not involve the prior restraint?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3341.473,3360.013,"That is correct sir, I think that that is one thing, and I think also that in the New York Times case several of the justice on this Court indicated first of all that there was no guidance from Congress as to whether there should be any restraint on the publication of those particular materials, and it was the Congress to set --"
1977.76-1450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3360.013,3376.185,Or almost there has not somebody subsequently prosecuted in a prosecution that aborted to be sure for violating some federal law and in divulging those Pentagon Papers to the --
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3376.185,3387.29,"I think though if I am thinking of the same case if it was Allsburg, I think it was aborted not though because of anything, any failure in the law, but because of --"
1977.76-1450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.29,3388.978,"No, because there was law, that is the point."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3402.933,3418.257,"Yes sir, but I think that the point that I am trying to make is that the Court found that there was no law which sanction the prior restraint, and that was the issue as I read the New York Times case that was before the Court."
1977.76-1450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.257,3424.736,The action was not a criminal prosecution; that was kind of an effort by the Government to enjoin the prior restraint.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3424.736,3433.928,"That is why we say that this is an entirely different matter and when you look at it in that context, we think that you get a different result."
1977.76-1450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.428,3499.42,"Well, General Kulp, I take it you are saying that the protection of the judge and the protection of the legal systems generally against insult are secondary justifications for the statute that you are saying that it is necessary to have an effective system to give, to offer confidentiality."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3500.93,3501.807,Yes sir.
1977.76-1450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.807,3524.259,"So you would not contend, I take it then, that the Virginia Statute that said, no one may publish a report that a judge is incompetent or that he is not doing his job right, until they have filed a complaint with the Commission and the Commissioner itself investigated and filed a formal complaint."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3524.259,3524.987,Yes sir.
1977.76-1450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.987,3529.322,"Well, then you would not -- would you defend that kind of a statute?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3529.322,3535.533,"No sir I do not think that is what the Supreme Court of Virginia, as well as the stature has indicated that it is merely drawn --"
1977.76-1450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.533,3543.559,"But that was protection for the judge, and protection at least for the judicial system generally, that was involved."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3546.779,3566.104,"No sir, I think that the cases from this Court are too clear in that respect that in other words a judge as any of public official may certainly be criticized, the administration of justice may be criticized, and we do not have any argument about that."
1977.76-1450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3621.194,3624.357,Or to protect against insult to the judicial system generally?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3624.357,3627.087,Or the insults against the judicial system in general.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3630.865,3640.955,"General Kulp do you have in our common stake the Commonwealth of Virginia, districts where there is only one Judge?"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3640.955,3642.872,We do not now Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.872,3644.35,There are always more than one.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3644.35,3645.319,There used to be.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3655.955,3667.398,Now suppose the lawyer is referenced to whom references made in your exhibit at Page 41.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3695.891,3699.535,"No sir, the statute would not prohibit that."
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3699.535,3713.858,"Well, what if he then said at the end of his press conference, “Tomorrow I will file all of these statements that I have made to you with the Commission and here is a copy of what I am going to give to the Commission.”"
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3715.03,3719.012,I believe that part of it would be a violation of the statute.
1977.76-1450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3719.012,3723.508,If it is done before in advance to the filing?
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3723.508,3754.144,"Well, I think if the -- perhaps not Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that if he did carry forth and make the filing, then I would have to assume that the it probably would come under the provisions of the statute, because it would be telling the press in advance that I am going to file it tomorrow, and that would be disclosing the information which is not confidential at that moment, but would take on confidentiality at the time."
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3754.144,3758.183,"Just a little point, it would depend on him to file it."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3758.183,3758.801,Yes sir.
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3758.801,3762.893,"If he did not file it, it would be printable."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3762.893,3765.447,"Yes sir, and we do not assert -- the statute does not --"
1977.76-1450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3765.447,3766.723,Since the statute is concerned.
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3766.723,3767.965,Prohibit that.
1977.76-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3769.26,3774.999,"Mr. Kulp, may I just ask one of the questions on this prior restraint presentation of the statute."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3797.121,3808.598,"Yes sir, I would have to say that that is true, because the statute provides that all confidential materials of the Commission must be files in the confidential files."
1977.76-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3886.14,3893.176,"But, the only way in which the statute permits the information to become into the public domain is through this legislative request."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3902.108,3906.225,"Yes sir, I would say under the statute that would be true."
1977.76-1450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3998.1,4008.072,"But if all of the participants in the procedure had adhered to the statutory ammunition to confidentiality, it would have remained confidential."
1977.76-1450,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,4008.072,4024.728,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and as I say, we are in sort of a dilemma here in certain respects, because the press wants to print the confidential information then on the other hand they want to protect the confidentiality of their source."
1977.76-1450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4029.608,4031.839,"Well, but that case is not being for us."
