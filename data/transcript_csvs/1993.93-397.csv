1993.93-397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.068,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-397, the Associated Industries of Missouri, v. Janet Lohman."
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,49.905,54.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.93-397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.354,165.859,"Is there any correspondence, Mr. Walsh, between the size of the local sales tax and the population of the taxing jurisdiction?"
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,165.859,168.022,"Not directly, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.02,197.821,"Mr. Walsh, at one time was there a provision that said if a local community imposes an additional sales tax of its own, that it would impose an equivalent use tax at the same time?"
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,197.821,204.145,"There was a provision, Justice O'Connor, in 1990, right before this particular law became effective."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.145,206.797,Had that been adopted by the legislature?
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,206.797,207.188,"Yes, it had."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.867,209.319,Did it ever go into effect?
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,209.319,212.711,"--Well, it was on the books for about a year, but it was never implemented."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.711,215.282,"Had that been implemented, would you be here?"
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,215.282,216.304,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.605,219.855,Why was it not implemented?
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,222.058,239.468,"--The record doesn't really show that, Your Honor, except that a) the state thought it was easier, apparently, to do it the way that it eventually decided to do it, and b) I think there was probably some concern about whether local voters would actually adopt a local use tax."
1993.93-397,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.468,246.691,Is that the method employed in some other States that allow local imposition of additional sales tax?
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,246.691,260.351,"The record shows, Your Honor, that there are 28 States that allow local use taxes, and every one of them has some sort of mechanism which prohibits the local use tax from being greater than the local sales tax."
1993.93-397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.622,281.016,But the National Conference of State Legislatures is amicus on the other side.
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,282.306,283.978,"--Very much so, yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.656,302.188,"Mr. Walsh, I may be repeating what Justice O'Connor asked you, but I want to be sure."
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,307.754,308.451,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,308.451,311.404,You are not attacking the local delegation power.
1993.93-397,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,311.404,315.437,The local delegation of sales taxes--
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1508.257,1511.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.307,1526.777,"Wait, I'm not sure that that's true."
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1556.697,1560.741,"--Your Honor, certainly there's ample precedent in this Court's cases... the Bacchus case, for example."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.741,1562.541,"--For that, you say yes, that's okay."
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1562.541,1584.085,"No... Your Honor, I'm saying in terms of, if the purpose for that county's action was to protect the local market segment, or an industry, if we're getting into the Bacchus situation where there's an identifiable market segment, that's one issue, but this Court's Commerce Clause cases have looked historically at the overall effect of State regulation on the national economy."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.881,1596.364,"So you... does that mean your answer to my question is, that is okay?"
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1596.364,1609.561,"If one county enacted a... decided to have no sales tax in order to benefit local businesses, that would be okay, as long as the overall effect of State regulation on the national economy was either neutral or pro interstate commerce, like it is here."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.561,1624.712,"One county can impose a $100 fee on people doing business in that county from out of State, so long as other counties give people doing business a rebate, in equivalent dollar amount?"
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1624.712,1630.685,"I think that's a different situation, Your Honor, because that's not a compensatory tax case."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.872,1682.921,"Wait, before you get off that one, what you're saying is, if the other counties had favored out-of-State waste, that would be okay, So a State can pass a law saying, the eastern half of our State, no out-of-State waste is allowed."
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1690.994,1692.116,--I think that--
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.116,1693.596,--so long as the net effect is pretty good.
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1693.596,1698.982,"--I think the Court could conclude, certainly, that that was not isolationist, that the State was trying to... not to--"
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.982,1699.981,"Oh, we could conclude anything we want."
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1702.435,1703.484,"--Well, it's not a compensatory tax case."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.955,1706.986,Is it constitutional or not?
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1706.986,1708.787,"--Yes, I think it could be."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.655,1722.237,We can split up a national market.
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1729.811,1749.633,"Your Honor, as long as this Court... the Court 2 years ago pointed out in Quill that unlike the Due Process Clause which is concerned with the effect on individuals and particular firms, the Commerce Clause is not concerned about particular interstate firms, it's concerned about the overall effect of State regulation on the national economy."
1993.93-397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.346,1752.127,Why do you say that?
1993.93-397,1,20786,don_m_downing,,1760.833,1761.821,"--Well, the Exxon--"
1993.93-397,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3194.804,3196.466,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3248.77,3250.192,Excuse me just a moment.
1993.93-397,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3254.904,3260.476,"Your Honor, as, I think Justice Stevens said, we are attacking the statute on its face."
1993.93-397,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.156,3278.949,Is it also stipulated that you paid it in jurisdictions where the use tax was higher than the sales tax?
1993.93-397,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3278.949,3283.613,"--Not expressly, no, but we have paid the tax."
1993.93-397,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3295.051,3296.04,Obviously not.
1993.93-397,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3297.282,3299.492,"--Well, but the statute isn't susceptible to that, Your Honor."
1993.93-397,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3306.197,3309.619,"Oh, we wouldn't have to do anything except say what the principle is, and the rest is for State law."
1993.93-397,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3309.619,3322.848,"--Well, the principle is that a taxing system that treats a use tax and a sales tax differently is now and forever discriminatory and facially invalid, and it's not General American that controls that."
1993.93-397,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.52,3416.07,"Thank you, Mr. Walsh."
