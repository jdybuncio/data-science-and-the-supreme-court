2003.02-1205,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.423,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1205, Edith Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,9.454,12.798,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.654,123.677,"Ms. Gorman, one of the anomalies that if...  if you are complaining about a refusal to hire, a discriminatory refusal to hire, the limitation would be 2 years, but if you're complaining about a discriminatory firing, it would be 4 years."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,134.284,135.855,Yes.
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.155,181.634,But one can see some rhyme or reason to those differences.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,189.929,193.273,"Well, we have to look at the plain meaning of the statute, Your Honor."
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,225.223,231.705,"Do you want us to interpret this section (b) as a new cause of action, in other words?"
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,231.705,234.306,The 1991 act.
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.907,237.278,Yes.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,237.278,239.962,of the claims that plaintiff could not file prior to...
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.962,240.622,Section (b).
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,243.677,244.048,Correct.
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.045,276.538,"If...  if you completely untie section (b) from section (a), number one, it doesn't make any sense, and number two, the...  the implied cause of action that we have found might disappear because we have told Congress, when you enact a new cause of action...  or a new statute, you have to say explicitly if it creates a private cause of action."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,276.538,285.992,"I believe Congress addressed that in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, codifying that this was a...  that there was a private right of action involved."
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.123,288.593,Where...  does it say that in 1981?
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,288.593,290.412,In 1981(c).
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.412,294.582,"Well, I...  I'm not sure I read it that way."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,294.582,301.352,The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernment discrimination and impairment under color of law.
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.352,305.356,That doesn't sound like an explicit creation of a cause of action to me.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,305.356,310.846,"Well, Your Honor, this Court had also said in Patterson that 1981 did create a private right of action."
2003.02-1205,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.846,313.612,"Well, that's what...  but that was under 1981."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,320.3,330.786,"I believe the language in section (c) was put in there just to confirm that what the Court said in Patterson, that this was a private right of action, was going forward with the new statute."
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.192,370.743,"Your...  your argument really rests on the proposition that arising under has a...  a uniform meaning, that it doesn't acquire different meanings in different contexts, doesn't it?"
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,370.743,384.035,I believe it rests on the proposition that the most common way of meaning...  using arising under is the way Justice Holmes described it and that's that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.451,413.839,"Well, we've...  we've also held that...  that arising under embraces not just a...  a Federal cause of action but even State causes of action that require determination of a Federal question for which the Federal question is...  is sort of essential."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,428.04,431.218,"I don't believe that's how the statute was...  was drafted, Your Honor."
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.193,464.988,"Not if you use arising under the way we use it in other contexts where...  where it...  a claim can...  can be thought to arise under, for purposes of...  of Federal court jurisdiction, even though the cause of action is...  is a State cause of action."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,464.988,475.595,"Your Honor, I believe arising under in this sense should be used in the way that it's most used by this Court and in the way that it's used in title 28, which is where this statute was...  is codified."
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.796,498.996,All right.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,503.504,516.962,But I believe this is the more consistent approach with how this Court has looked at arising under in the...  in the jurisdictional context because that is where this Court...  that is where Congress has placed this definition in the statute.
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.962,517.195,I don't think so.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,554.874,570.256,"Your Honor, what I'm suggesting is that the...  the reasoning of this Court has been consistently that under title 28, arising under has been used as Justice Holmes has suggested it, and that's what I'm suggesting is the...  is the bright line rule that this Court should follow in this case."
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.256,571.575,I'm suggesting that's wrong.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,571.575,573.228,"I understand, Your Honor."
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.228,602.7,"What do you do with the hypothetical that was raised in...  in the briefs on the other side that suppose Congress shrinks the people who are exempt from title VII, say, and makes it 15 or more employees instead of 25 or more employees?"
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,614.771,616.817,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe they do."
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.734,646.167,"But...  but in...  in determining what Congress meant, is it...  wouldn't it be relevant that that seems something no legislature would want to have happen, that people who are newly covered by the same prescription get more time to sue than people who have always been covered?"
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,646.167,650.625,"Your Honor, first that example comes from title VII which does have its own..."
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.625,650.858,I know.
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.858,651.23,I know.
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.23,657.068,So we had to pick one that comes under 1981 or 1982.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,657.068,690.982,"I still think we have to give the plain meaning of the...  of the statute its effect, and Congress...  we have to understand that Congress set this as a default and if Congress does not want to have this anomaly where people who are between 15 and 25 employees in a...  in an employment relationship where it's under 25 employees and now a cause of action has been created for them...  if Congress does not want to have that situation, then Congress is going to have to draft a statute of limitations which that...  with that law, which Congress has shown under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that it is more than willing and able to do."
2003.02-1205,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,721.447,744.935,Another problem that was raised in the brief on the other side was what would you do with a circuit that had a law...  that it had interpreted the law as allowing no claim and there's a circuit where other circuits have...  have allowed a claim in the...  and we haven't spoken.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,770.942,781.883,"I believe in most cases I think everyone will get 4 years, and the reason I say that is because section 1658 does not address the circuit...  circuit split."
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.628,798.063,"Well, but that...  that's the issue, whether it was codified before."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,844.753,848.839,I...  I think one thing that we would always be able to do is to look at these statutes.
2003.02-1205,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,864.443,864.709,But in...  in...
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,864.709,865.269,I'm sorry.
2003.02-1205,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,865.269,865.724,I'm sorry.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,886.323,886.489,No.
2003.02-1205,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.232,887.604,Okay.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,887.604,889.173,That is what I'm suggesting.
2003.02-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.173,890.826,"Well...  well, it has to..."
2003.02-1205,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.826,892.805,But what about the circuit that already recognized the cause of action?
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,907.173,915.429,"I don't think it would be a new cause of action but it would now be arising under an act of Congress that was enacted after 1990, and I think..."
2003.02-1205,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.429,918.856,But the Seventh Circuit thought it arose under an act of Congress even before the amendment.
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,918.856,931.859,"I understand, Your Honor, but I think if you look at the purpose of the statute and if we use Patterson as an example, in Patterson the Court said there was no claim under 1981 for post-contract claims."
2003.02-1205,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.669,947.685,"Oh, I see."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,947.685,948.207,and defining.
2003.02-1205,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.001,954.728,"Very well, Ms. Gorman."
2003.02-1205,0,27097,h_candace_gorman,,954.728,955.554,Thank you.
2003.02-1205,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.554,959.269,"Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,959.269,966.949,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1205,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.422,1000.386,"Mr. Garre, as has already been pointed out, the interpretation does give rise to some anomalies and interpreting it the other way might as well."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1008.764,1009.424,Well...
2003.02-1205,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.424,1010.622,How could it have been written...
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1010.622,1010.993,Justice...
2003.02-1205,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.993,1012.275,so we wouldn't be in this mess?
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1012.275,1020.653,"Justice O'Connor, I think some of the...  the issues that have been identified to the Court are a direct product of the compromise that Congress struck in 1990."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.21,1083.689,What if the statute did create those claims?
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1085.751,1086.328,We...
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.328,1091.241,It seems to me you don't give the same answer that...  that the petitioner does.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1091.241,1101.355,"Justice Scalia, we think that the circuit split problem would be resolved for purposes of section 1658 the same way it would be resolved for retroactivity purposes."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.202,1137.726,So you're saying we...  we will have to resolve these...  these circuit splits for no purpose whatever except to decide whether the statute of limitations applies.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1138.719,1139.462,"No, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.304,1158.942,As you interpret it.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1158.942,1171.307,"As we interpret it, and we think that that is the plain meaning of Congress' use of both the...  the all-inclusive term, the traditionally inclusive term, arising under, as well as Congress' reference to an act of Congress."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.307,1176.758,What...  what is your position as to whether the statute of limitations applies to State causes of action?
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1176.758,1180.018,We don't think it applies to State causes of action at all.
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.018,1182.99,"Then you're not using the all-inclusive term, arising under."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1182.99,1186.705,"Well, that's not a product that Congress has used of arising under."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.445,1202.493,"Well, and...  and you say they didn't because...  so your...  since it's absurd to think they did that, you're...  you're giving arising under a narrower interpretation than...  than we give it for..."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1202.493,1202.659,Well...
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.659,1205.138,for purposes of...  of Federal jurisdiction.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1205.138,1217.52,"In the first place, we think that plaintiffs' claims arise under the 1991 Civil Rights Act under any definition of arising under, dictionary definition, the statutory definition, and 28 U.S.C. 1331..."
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.52,1228.005,"But...  but that contradicts your other position that...  that we're going to have to resolve this question in order to determine the circuit splits because if you believe that, your...  your answer would be the same as...  as the petitioners."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1236.633,1237.005,No.
2003.02-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.005,1237.914,That's not your position.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1237.914,1251.122,"The question would be the same question that this Court considered in the Rivers case which was whether or not Congress created new causes of action in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the Court analyzed that question by looking to Congress' intent enacting that act."
2003.02-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.589,1308.791,"Well, it did so in the Truth in Lending Act and...  and the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1310.155,1317.214,"But...  but, Justice Kennedy, Congress often chooses to...  to build upon existing Federal law in creating causes of action."
2003.02-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.214,1320.679,"Well, in this case, what about the problem with the implied cause of action?"
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1325.798,1338.595,"We think...  from our understanding of section (c), it was intended to clarify that section 1981 does create a private right of action, which...  which this Court had held in Runyan and reaffirmed in Patterson."
2003.02-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.156,1375.376,"You mean respondent, yes."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1375.376,1375.914,Respondent.
2003.02-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1524.621,1527.948,What was the period prescribed in the Sarbanes-Oxley statute?
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1527.948,1537.896,"It's 2 years after the discovery of facts and 5 years after the violation, which is different than the 4-year rule established by Congress in section 1658(a)."
2003.02-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.985,1570.59,Will there be some retroactivity problems if some States have 6-year statute of limitations and this reduces that period?
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1570.59,1571.499,No.
2003.02-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.86,1575.026,Yes.
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1575.026,1592.299,"As Judge Alito explained in the Zubi dissent, there's no retroactivity problems because the only expectation that a plaintiff could have after Congress created the new causes of action in 1991 is if those causes of actions would be subject to the default statute of limitations specified."
2003.02-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.299,1592.67,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2003.02-1205,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1592.67,1593.23,Thank you.
2003.02-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.23,1594.883,We'll hear now from Mr. Phillips.
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1594.883,1599.425,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1205,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.008,1698.043,"The solution to the last problem you raised offered by the petitioner is simply you use the newer statute, and you don't have to look into the question of...  of which side of the circuit conflict was correct."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1711.956,1717.279,"Well, it might be an adequate solution, Justice Scalia, except that it's not self-evident from the language, arising under."
2003.02-1205,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.852,1750.056,"But I think isn't her answer to the...  to the fact that it isn't self-evident from the language alone an answer she gave to a separate question, and that is that it's the policy of Congress to apply the...  the 4-year rule when it can so that if in doubt...  if the language allows but doesn't compel, then the answer would be apply the new statute because that is going to get to the congressional objective of getting the 4-year statute as broad..."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1750.056,1756.372,And there...  and I don't think there's support for that objective in...  in this particular statute because if Congress really meant...
2003.02-1205,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1756.372,1776.351,"Well, isn't the...  isn't the support that they started out by intending to...  to apply the 4-year period, I mean, across the board and they...  they only fell back out of fear of...  of violating reliance interests which would say the...  the objective is still to get the broadest possible application?"
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1776.351,1777.26,"Well, no."
2003.02-1205,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1796.375,1796.779,They could...
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1796.779,1797.505,they do that every day.
2003.02-1205,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1797.505,1817.551,"they could have said that, but the...  the counter-argument to...  to what you've just said is...  and...  and maybe this is...  I hope you'll comment on this, that on your reading, the 4-year statute is...  is rarely going to be applied simply because there...  there aren't very many sort of absolutely brand-new, freestanding, self-contained causes of action."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1820.895,1824.732,"Well, Justice Souter, the...  the reality is that this is far more common than you think."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.217,1845.62,"Yes, but the argument is the other way."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1883.476,1889.588,"Well, no, I understand that, but the problem you still have, Justice Breyer, is that you've got to figure out how do you try to reconcile..."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.588,1894.417,"Well, we reconcile it by saying if it's a new...  you look at the act of Congress."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1910.969,1921.167,"That's...  that's pretty simple, Justice Breyer, but it doesn't answer Justice Kennedy's question which is if you look at this particular act of Congress, which is codified in subsection (b), it doesn't give you any basis for a right of action."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.532,1925.383,"It doesn't give you any...  oh, now, now, all right..."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1925.383,1926.681,That definitional provision doesn't remotely...
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1926.681,1933.722,"that...  that...  if you're asking me the question, I'd answer that question by saying, of course, they intended a private right of action to apply."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1937.232,1937.432,"But, Justice Breyer, that's..."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.432,1941.402,And I think...  I think that by the...  but that's a different issue.
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1950.152,1968.645,"But I still...  but that still doesn't answer what...  what strikes me as the fundamental question which is when Congress approached section 1981, did it think that it was, in fact, creating a whole new infrastructure cause of action or was it basically simply engrafting it back onto what section 1981 has been since 1866."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.645,1978.016,"It was engrafting it on and before they passed the act of Congress, you did not have this kind of cause of action, and after they wrote the new act, you did have it."
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.016,1979.009,Therefore...
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1979.009,1992.755,"But...  but you...  but, Justice Breyer, you only have this cause of action because four...  three of the four elements arise and existed long before 1991, and those...  and that...  and it clearly has to arise under that portion of it as well."
2003.02-1205,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.414,2023.841,"I think their answer is, as I understand it, that is the approach that gives maximum effect to the new statutes of limitation that...  that Congress has enacted."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2028.792,2032.014,There is no evidence that Congress wanted it to have maximum effect.
2003.02-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.014,2033.416,"Well, except the fact they enacted the statute."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2033.416,2042.333,The statute applies on a regular basis to almost everyday acts that Congress adopts in which they provide a cause of action and do not provide a statute of limitations.
2003.02-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.291,2066.398,"One of the problems that troubles me about borrowing State law...  I've had a lot of experience in these cases...  that if you look at this statute under State law, I think the old cause of action that Patterson recognized would be a contract cause of action."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2086.915,2092.366,"Except that I think, for the most part, the courts have pretty well resolved what they were going to do with respect to section 1981."
2003.02-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.685,2097.772,"Well, the section 1981 as construed in Patterson is clearly a contract claim."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2097.772,2098.072,Right.
2003.02-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.072,2101.737,But as...  but this cause of action I don't think is clearly a contract claim.
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2101.737,2104.542,"Well, it's difficult to know whether Congress meant to change that."
2003.02-1205,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2134.141,2139.26,How much...  how much trouble are we going to have in the future if...  if we adopted your...  your theory?
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2154.575,2168.05,I...  I think every court that has adopted that test...  certainly the Seventh Circuit in this case and other courts of appeals have recognized that it is an infinitely simpler test than trying to figure out what arising under will mean in all of its various permutations and new statutes.
2003.02-1205,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.834,2197.837,"But one thing that isn't simpler about it, Mr. Phillips, is the problem that Congress sought to cure with 1658, that is, you can have amazing diversity across the country if you're borrowing States' limits."
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2210.774,2223.101,"On a prospective basis, there's no question about that, that the Congress had passed the Anti-terrorism Act that created a new cause of action, did not want the kind of inherent inequalities that arise under borrowing to go forward."
2003.02-1205,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.101,2224.01,And that's suggesting that...
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2224.01,2225.746,It says nothing about what the Congress did retroactively.
2003.02-1205,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2225.746,2232.062,that the old way is inherently complex because you have to figure out which would be the closest State limitation.
2003.02-1205,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2244.322,2263.557,"Well, I...  Justice Ginsburg, your own hypotheticals suppose exactly how many complexities are going to arise, and I...  I can assure you that as...  as much imagination as we've put into this, plaintiffs' counsels and defense counsel going forward will try even harder to end up fighting these issues in terms of the...  in terms of complex this is."
2003.02-1205,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.102,2290.339,All right.
2003.02-1205,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.339,2291.132,Look...  look at your own interpretation.
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2781.02,2798.566,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1205,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2855.78,2871.755,"But, Mr. Newsom, the reason that Congress grandfathered the claims that already existed, as Mr. Phillips said, was because of expectations that I'm off the hook after 2 years, say."
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2880.095,2889.92,"Well, I think the...  the expectations that Congress sought to protect in...  in section 1658 were expectations with respect to certain categories of claims."
2003.02-1205,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2979.456,2985.566,How can you say it's fine tuning an existing cause of action if the plaintiff couldn't have recovered before the 1991 amendment?
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2985.566,2995.06,"Well, I think the...  the key consideration here is that Congress had a choice in the 1991 act how it would respond to this Court's decision in Patterson."
2003.02-1205,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.487,3011.673,"Would you agree with Mr. Phillips if they'd written a different statute that came out with exactly the same result, but they just said...  it would not...  not redefine words but simply said, in addition to what you can already do you, you may also recover for what happens on the job?"
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3011.673,3038.118,"I agree with Mr. Phillips, and having...  having just said that the strongest indication of Congress' intent to create a new cause of action would be its creation of an entirely new statutory scheme, I do agree that as...  as Congress moves away from that paradigm, that it may, for instance, in a freestanding section 1981(d), if it enacts all of the elements of a new...  of a new claim, that yes, indeed, that would create a new cause of action within...  within the meaning of section 1658."
2003.02-1205,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.118,3048.642,"But if it had done that, then we'd still have the same problems of deciding whether the...  a particular...  like class 2 in this case, whether they come under one section rather than the other."
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3049.468,3053.1,I'm not...  I'm not sure that that's exactly right.
2003.02-1205,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3098.797,3114.651,"I...  I suppose any suggestion that we would be creating a...  a problem for Congress in giving it...  in posing a dilemma for it is that they can provide, number one, a new statute and have the statute of limitations set forth specifically."
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3114.651,3115.681,"Well, that's certainly true."
2003.02-1205,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.433,3191.404,"It's also true, is it not, that this is one of those unique cases in which the...  the 4-year rule will help some plaintiffs and help defendants in other cases because some of the State statutes for certain causes are actually longer than 4 years?"
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3194.831,3195.491,That's certainly right.
2003.02-1205,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.332,3271.547,"One other question, if I may."
2003.02-1205,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3283.724,3286.985,"There may well be Justice Stevens, not that I'm aware of off the top of my head."

2003.02-1205,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.005,3319.473,"And did they do it...  did that statute do it just by redefining a term, redefining..."
2003.02-1205,4,27097,h_candace_gorman,,3319.473,3325.689,"Correct, Your Honor, by redefining discrimination based on sex to also include discrimination in pregnancy."
2003.02-1205,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.689,3325.977,Yes.
2003.02-1205,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.977,3327.752,That was in response to our Gilbert case.
2003.02-1205,4,27097,h_candace_gorman,,3327.752,3328.206,Correct.
2003.02-1205,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.25,3394.215,I...  I don't know what you're saying when you say it takes it from them.
2003.02-1205,4,27097,h_candace_gorman,,3401.124,3402.593,"Correct, Your Honor, where they take..."
2003.02-1205,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.593,3403.214,"Well, I don't think..."
2003.02-1205,4,27097,h_candace_gorman,,3403.214,3405.033,terms out of the new...  out of old legislation.
2003.02-1205,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.033,3406.436,I don't think your opponent would...  would count them.
2003.02-1205,4,27097,h_candace_gorman,,3418.984,3431.699,"Well, Your Honor, if that's the case, then I think what respondent must be suggesting then is that section 1658 would only come into play if the new statute was the only statute you were relying on."
2003.02-1205,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.062,3514.177,"Thank you, Ms. Gorman."
