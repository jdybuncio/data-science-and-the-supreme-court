1974.73-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.656,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1923, Eastland against Servicemen's Fund."
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,56.458,61.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.586,188.84,Who served it Mr. Miller?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,188.84,189.286,I don't --
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.286,190.371,Does that appear on the record?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,190.371,194.32,I don't believe the record shows who served the subpoena.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,194.32,195.861,"Well, he didn't mail it?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,195.861,195.914,I do not --
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.914,198.992,Because they didn't mail it and I don't suppose the chairman took it down there?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,198.992,201.658,I have assumed that the Chairman did not.
1974.73-1923,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.788,233.208,"To say it must allege that it was served, isn't it?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,233.208,234.966,"As I read the complaint sir, it does not and I --"
1974.73-1923,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.966,236.427,(Voice Overlap) to say that it was issued?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,236.427,240.699,"I believe, I believe the record is silent on that point."
1974.73-1923,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.699,243.925,And all the allegation is that it was issued?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,243.925,247.071,The defendant caused the subpoena “to be issued.”
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,247.071,253.454,"Well, is that -- and that is what the injury is apparently just from the issuance, is that all?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,253.454,280.752,"The complaint then goes on and alleges that the subpoena is void under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Amendments and says that the -- and the Tenth amendment and that the sole purpose of the subpoena is to chill the First Amendment right of the United States Servicemen's Fund."
1974.73-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,454.638,455.686,"Mr. Miller, I --"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,455.686,457.52,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.52,484.664,"I don't know whether it's of any importance or not but since the question arose and you have undertaken to answer it about the subpoena, I have thought and I find that my memory was correct that on page 13 of the appendix there is an allegation, paragraph nine at the bottom that the Senate Committee, subcommittee caused to be served on the Chemical Bank of New York, the subpoena duces tecum?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,484.664,490.227,"If my memory serves me correctly Your Honor, that is the fist subpoena."
1974.73-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,498.11,500.164,We're just concern with the one on 16.
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,500.164,502.957,We are just concern with the third subpoena.
1974.73-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.337,1085.432,"Mr. Miller, this is really a separate argument than from your speech and debate clause argument, isn't it?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1085.432,1086.392,It is Your Honor.
1974.73-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.392,1092.384,"Because if you win on the speech and debate clause, it doesn't matter whether these records are protected or not, I presume?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1092.384,1094.737,"That's correct, that is correct."
1974.73-1923,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1095.969,1099.952,"Is the separate argument from your separation of powers argument too, isn't it?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1100.95,1101.093,Yeah.
1974.73-1923,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1101.093,1101.675,Thank you.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.675,1102.711,"Oh, Mr. Miller, I am --"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1102.711,1102.842,Yes sir.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.842,1111.19,"-- not so sure about that that if you went on your speech and debate clause issue, the case is over?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1111.19,1112.046,I believe it is.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.046,1129.208,"Well, I would have thought that if the, let's just assume that the rights of the organizations are violated by the amendment in the sense -- and then the -- and that in order to get off the hook, you have to plead legislative immunity."
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1148.931,1152.485,"Under Kilbourn versus Thompson, that is precisely the situation as applied here."
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.485,1164.68,"Well, I would suppose then that if the person who is serving the subpoena is committing an unlawful, unconstitutional act, he can only be held liable for damages but he can be enjoined, he can be enjoined?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1164.68,1168.213,If in fact it is beyond the legislative sphere.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.213,1169.291,"Well, it's a --"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1169.291,1170.497,He can be enjoined.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.497,1171.038,"Well, its --"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1171.038,1174.809,"My argument, if the Court please is that it is not."
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.809,1178.584,"I understand, I know, issuing the subpoena you say, stays within the legislative sphere?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1178.584,1179.01,Yes sir.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.01,1195.932,"But if the subpoena itself is -- if it invades some constitutional rights or some others, that somewhere along the line that at least where it actually impinges on somebody, Kilbourn against Thompson would indicate that the courts can intervene."
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1210.069,1219.293,I would -- that is a part -- that is a part of the equation if the Court please where eventually you would end up.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.659,1239.944,I think in the Gravel -- in Gravel and the other cases expressly said that a Senator or neither a Senator nor his aides can go out and break in to somebody's house to -- illegally in order to gather information for a hearing?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1239.944,1241.299,I remember your language very well.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.299,1241.712,"Yes, I thought you would."
1974.73-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1241.712,1250.735,But you knew -- you never got to the third party question here did you because the banks were never served?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1250.735,1255.916,"The banks were in fact defendants in this suit, they just did not participate in the appeal."
1974.73-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.916,1261.249,"Well, did you get to the point according to the record where the banks were about to produce the records?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1261.249,1268.365,"In one of the House of Representative cases, one or more the bank did in fact produced some of the records."
1974.73-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.365,1268.599,In the Senate?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1268.599,1282.454,"But those three cases, I want to emphasize to the court really are -- whether a part of this case they're in effect tag along because everyone has treated the Eastland case as the case that governs all of them."
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.144,1312.858,"Mr. Miller, let me just ask, suppose the Senators and the Congressmen in the committee had never been parties to this suit?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1340.177,1341.131,"Mr. Justice White, --"
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.131,1341.981,Can it?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1341.981,1378.055,"Mr. Justice, let me, of course it cannot claim legislative immunity but the case you put it would be fine and if that is -- if that is the way the court will treat the opinion below and leave within the legislative sphere, the Senators and the aides because they were in fact totally immune by their activities under the speech or debate clause then and only then do we address the question, does their stand can an individual whose records are with the bank, file some type of an action against the bank, a motion to quash the subpoena --"
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.055,1378.936,May I ask you --
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1378.936,1383.235,And that sir is a -- is not the case that we have before the court today.
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.235,1392.393,That isn't off the -- it doesn't get off the hook just because the Senators might be immune?
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1392.393,1395.14,I would not argue that to the court because --
1974.73-1923,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.14,1396.545,"Oh, I thought you were a while ago?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1396.545,1398.059,"No sir, not at all."
1974.73-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.441,1435.306,"What is the impact right today, here and now of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the Senators?"
1974.73-1923,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1435.306,1442.831,They are -- the Court of Appeals reinstate -- they were -- the Senators were dismissed as defendant by the trial court.
1974.73-1923,1,30474,jeremiah_s_gutman,,1638.033,1642.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1923,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.46,1749.121,So it was only in that case -- the only parties are the congressional?
1974.73-1923,1,30474,jeremiah_s_gutman,,1749.121,1751.189,Congressional parties and staff.
1974.73-1923,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.189,1753.232,"Well that -- I mean, and it include the staff."
1974.73-1923,1,30474,jeremiah_s_gutman,,1753.232,1753.548,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2591.385,2593.977,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.631,2657.711,"Well, whether to pursue that analogy, if it's in -- offered as an analogy, the case you referred to seemed -- seems to me to have held that when the judicial branch needs records to perform its function, the judicial branch will get them no matter where they are?"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2669.297,2676.643,"I would suggest there are at least two distinctions, one of course is the fact that the records here are First Amendment material."
1974.73-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.667,2712.335,Was there a power in the District Court or the Court of Appeals to narrow the scope of the subpoena so as in its view to avoid disclosing membership as such?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2712.335,2713.763,In this particular case?
1974.73-1923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2799.851,2806.481,What's your authority for the fact that the speech and debate clause doesn't apply to actions for declaratory relief?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2806.481,2817.98,"Well, let me start by suggesting that there has never been a case that I have seen that has in fact held that and if we look to the most recent opinions of this Court, we see very, very sharp distinction made."
1974.73-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.783,2876.364,"Yeah, but in the speech or debate clause cases it seems to me one of the purposes of the clause has been said to be that Senators and Congressmen should not be called into court to even answer the claims within the scope of -- within the scope of the clause?"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2876.364,2876.559,I think that --
1974.73-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.559,2880.004,And that's part of the -- that's just to keep them from being bothered so much?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2880.004,2881.591,There are several things that had been said.
1974.73-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.85,2908.379,"Yeah, (Inaudible) --if you are right, you have to answer the -- you have to hire a lawyer, you have to hire Mr. Miller or somebody and pay him a lot of money and take your time and energies away from your job?"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2908.379,2927.724,"The reality Your Honor is that in this kind of a declaratory and injunctive action, in fact normally the government represents the committee as it did in the two courts below just as the government is involved in defending the constitutionality of that committee's subpoena if there's a criminal contempt case that arises out of it, its no different."
1974.73-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.724,2929.809,Isn't there another factor here.
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2957.025,2969.772,"Your Honor, I would some how doubt that they would even consider violating an order of a court so that the problem of contempt is not a realistic one at least I would certainly hope not but the one thing I'd like to suggest is that if this is a very, very narrow case."
1974.73-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2969.772,2970.018,Do you think that --
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2970.018,2970.033,We --
1974.73-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.033,2971.108,-- answers the problem that --
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,2971.108,2972.905,"Why, I think its part of the answer."
1974.73-1923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.572,3019.576,But that's because Congress -- that's because Congress then seeks the aid of the courts in order to enforce its subpoena.
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3028.655,3033.719,We haven't -- of course we haven't waited Your Honor because we in fact can't wait.
1974.73-1923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.281,3096.623,But no one would contend that the actions of the Justice Department and the executive branch in prosecuting a defendant who's been cited by the Congress for contempt is a part of the congressional function and that's why -- that never arises in those cases.
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3100.297,3101.038,What we --
1974.73-1923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.038,3103.508,You're in quite a different situation here?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3103.508,3127.475,What we would suggest Your Honor is that the situation isn't quite that different at all and that in fact implicit in the subpoena is the obvious possibility that what will follow is the executive branch and the judicial branch becoming involved and using the full weight of the government against the party upon whom the subpoena has been served.
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.641,3222.068,"Would your argument be the same if there were no staff members involved, its just the Congress committee chairman issued the subpoena or himself --"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3222.068,3222.138,Well --
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3222.138,3224.009,You wouldn't think he was protected?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3224.009,3227.955,"Frankly prior to Gravel, I would have assumed that there was some sort of difference between staff members --"
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3227.955,3229.082,"Well, since (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3229.082,3230.336,But now I would think not.
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.091,3236.053,You mean when -- you mean it could be --
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3236.053,3237.811,As the staff member would be.
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3237.862,3240.142,You mean he could be questioned?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3240.142,3256.886,"There is a distinction between questioning him personally, questioning his motivations and issuing a declaratory judgment saying that the subpoena he issued and had authorized and had enforced, had served is unconstitutional."
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3260.958,3263.549,In what basis would it be unconstitutional?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3263.549,3271.034,"In this instance on the basis of the First Amendment, perhaps the Fourth and other amendments but certainly as Judge Tuttle held under the First Amendment."
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3318.477,3325.931,"But this goes to the bank, its all -- as it goes out of the hall, it doesn't go out there, they send a subpoena to the bank and the bank sends them the record?"
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3325.931,3328.743,"Well, that's exactly it, it goes beyond the Congress."
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3330.993,3335.897,I suppose -- they suppose -- does the subpoena tell them to bring them?
1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3335.897,3337.131,That's the same thing.

1974.73-1923,2,37290,nancy_stearns,,3351.512,3353.765,-- able to get an injunction against the bank.
1974.73-1923,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3354.586,3358.916,"The injunction says to the bank, bring us -- bring your records in?"
