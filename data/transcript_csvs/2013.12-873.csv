2013.12-873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-873, Lexmark International v. Static Control Components."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,10.156,12.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.358,68.41,"The Lanham Act goes well beyond the common law, doesn't it?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,68.41,75.898,--The Lanham Act provides some causes of action that are beyond the common law.
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,85.689,86.889,Okay.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,102.049,116.958,"I think there are two components to the common law and -- and we'll -- and I'll talk now about the most general component, and that are considerations of proximate cause and foreseeability that were in place when the Sherman and Tate Acts were enacted."
2013.12-873,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.446,155.266,Tell me why the answer to that question doesn't end this case here?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,172.378,175.08,--Two points.
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.058,195.243,It doesn't mention what at all?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,195.927,198.279,"--It does not mention Static Control at all, the Respondent."
2013.12-873,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,251.247,258.818,I -- I assume you would agree that the manufacturer of the cartridges that compete with Lexmark would have standing here.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,258.818,261.203,"And, in fact, in this case, they did have standing."
2013.12-873,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,266.756,282.016,"But it's not a very big step from the manufacturer of the cartridge that competes to the manufacturer of the chip, which is really the essential component of -- or an essential component of the cartridge that competes."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,282.016,283.468,"Well, we think it is."
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.385,320.241,"Well, then you could -- you could sue them for infringing on your patent or whatever intellectual property protection you have."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,376.328,390.587,"--Certainly, the Lanham Act uses the any person language and that language is no different, though, than the any person language appears in the antitrust statutes and in RICO, both instances in which this Court adopted AGC tests to determine standing."
2013.12-873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,403.295,424.209,"Suppose you have the -- shouldn't a supplier have standing to sue the competitor of the firm to which he supplies the where the alleged liable or slander or whatever it is, is directly about what the supplier supplies."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,472.558,479.295,That supplier may very well have standing to bring a State law claim for defamation.
2013.12-873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,479.295,488.484,"Why not, why not -- why not in this Lanham Act suit, why shouldn't the chocolate sauce supplier have standing?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,496.507,507.463,"We believe to give intent to Section 45, which states that the purpose is unfair competition, standing under the Lanham Act is going to be a narrow, focused inquiry."
2013.12-873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.811,541.036,"Well, the answer to your question, if you're asking, is no, because the person who supplies labels is totally -- the statement that is sued about has nothing to do with labels."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,548.44,548.94,I do.
2013.12-873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,548.94,549.474,All right.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,557.745,564.734,We think the Lanham Act does and should have a narrow standing requirement.
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,576.542,584.463,"Mr. Loy, can I ask you what you think this standing doctrine is all about in a context like this?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,593.335,595.52,I think so.
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,603.026,604.109,"Well, one of the questions."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,628.375,631.094,That should always be a question.
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,648.655,655.828,"I guess, if that's the question the AGC test strikes me as not the answer to that question."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,669.302,684.061,"--I think that the -- this Court's decision in Holmes, and I believe it was the concurrence by Justice Scalia, identified the proximate cause factors as part of any standing analysis."
2013.12-873,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.472,730.459,"Except there are two remedies under this statute, injunctive relief and damages."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,757.359,775.155,"And just as there are injunctive remedies available in the antitrust statute and in this Court's decision in Cargill, I think in a footnote the Court noted that if all you have is an injunctive request under antitrust statutes, some of those factors may not be relevant."
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.325,783.011,--But proximate cause?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,793.783,794.818,--No.
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.853,800.972,Answer my question.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,806.959,807.326,--No.
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.326,807.742,--Because--
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,807.742,816.565,I think it is likely still appropriate in an injunctive analysis to look at the proximity of the plaintiff and the defendant.
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.588,832.175,Explain to me why -- we are talking in abstract terms.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,866.581,875.103,"Again, there very well could be State law remedies available to plaintiffs who do not have standing under the Lanham Act."
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.103,878.388,But I'm not asking about State law remedies.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,890.03,892.898,We--
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.898,912.396,"And if you just read this section, would you agree that -- what is the party -- SCC is someone who has been injured, damaged, by the false advertising?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,912.396,917.28,--We agree they make that Article III allegation.
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.415,1035.758,Is there any question here that there was an intent on the part of Lexmark to stop the Static Control company from making these microchips?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1035.758,1040.744,"--Well, again, on the alleged facts of this case--"
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.744,1041.611,Yes.
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1063.794,1069.931,--We would disagree with that characterization of -- of their counterclaim.
2013.12-873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.905,1092.01,"And the -- the directive, the letter said don't buy Static Control's product because if you do, you're in jeopardy of being a contributory infringer."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1092.01,1100.033,"--What it first says to the remanufacturers is that if you remanufacture our cartridge -- our Prebate cartridge generally, you infringe our rights."
2013.12-873,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1260.454,1267.71,"So what's wrong with the tests adopted by three circuits, the reasonable interest test?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1267.71,1274.464,"We think it suffers from, in this instance, because here we have -- we have the Lanham Act."
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1317.457,1324.463,"Mr. -- Mr. Loy, you said there's universal recognition that there should be prudential standing requirements in the Lanham Act."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1355.249,1362.07,"We think in any Federal statutory cause of action, prudential standing requirements are presumed."
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1406.534,1418.841,"And -- and you just sort of know them when you see them or it's a reaction to what are perceived to be very broad statutes or, you know, when -- when do we know that we should be offered a prudential standing jag?"
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1418.841,1425.912,I think -- I think the -- the first place you look is at the text of the statute itself.
2013.12-873,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1455.532,1467.655,"Well, maybe the answer is when we just can't believe that Congress really meant the literal words of the statute to be interpreted without some limiting principle."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1497.692,1499.043,That's correct.
2013.12-873,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1514.136,1528.146,"But there, couldn't that be done just by interpreting the -- the language of the statue in accord with its purposes, because you have a specific purpose provision in the Lanham Act that says we're -- we're trying to get at commercial competition here."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1528.146,1538.101,"--I think standing is in many, if not most instances, a separate analysis from the cause of action itself."
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.137,1543.255,--What is prudential standing?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1554.028,1554.98,"It can, and--"
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.98,1560.451,And -- and is it the kind of standing that we would have to raise on our own?
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1573.842,1579.179,--It's -- at least I normally don't think of it in terms of jurisdictional.
2013.12-873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.587,1601.675,"I'm uncomfortable with the notion that, you know, in my prudence I give standing here and I deny standing there, it's up to me."
2013.12-873,0,41676,steven_b_loy,,1618.82,1623.356,--And I think the phrase ‶ statutory standing ″ would be fine with us.
2013.12-873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1631.695,1632.48,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1639.484,1642.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.032,1723.455,How do you -- how do you square that with the statutory provision that the purpose of the law is to prevent unfair competition?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1728.441,1741.951,"Where Section 45 says that it is designed to protect those engaged in such commerce from unfair competition, it's referring to what is defined in the operative text as unfair trade practices."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.564,1792.551,Suppose the comments in this case only disparaged the cartridges themselves and not the chips.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1796.17,1810.612,"Yes, if the statements are about the legality of remanufacturing Lexmark's printer cartridges, all of those statements are about Static Control's products and the legality of using them, the places where those can be lawfully used."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1831.609,1849.054,"Well, that may be true, but I don't understand how you get from the zone of interest to the limiting principle that you are suggesting, which is that the zone of interest includes only those businesses, other than the direct competitor, whose products are targeted by the false statements."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1849.054,1867.516,"As Mr. Loy recognized, in the legislative history of the Act and in this Court's opinion in Daystar, the Court has said the core principle of the Lanham Act as a whole is to protect commercial actors' goodwill and reputation, and that can be seen in the trademark provisions."
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.811,1889.464,Did you answer his question?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1901.105,1913.413,"The disparagement, the statements about the uses to which Static Control's products may be put are all implicit in all of the false advertisements that are at issue in this case."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1932.391,1932.774,All right.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1946.218,1949.67,It depends upon the context of the case.
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1979.022,1979.605,All right.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,1998.953,2004.757,"I think if it's not being talked about in that case, that company probably would not have standing."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.048,2049.218,"So if Bailey's was the only place that sold this chocolate sauce, Bailey's might have standing."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2056.122,2065.478,"In the hypothetical that I hear from Justice Breyer, the statement was: The chocolate sauce that Bailey's uses is poisonous."
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.799,2072.901,How do we tie that in?
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.055,2080.571,I am too because I'm sick of it.
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.571,2082.94,--But it illustrates the point.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2154.971,2171.314,"Justice Breyer, we think, respectfully, that the circuits' tests don't necessarily encompass this situation as well as they could, which is why we suggest that it's best for the Court to step back to first principles of prudential standing, which is the zone of interest analysis."
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2171.314,2182.538,"Has that been applied outside the context of the APA, that is when the suit is against an agency?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2182.538,2184.574,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.574,2189.792,Has it been applied to private party litigation?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2189.792,2190.911,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.69,2226.734,"If that's so -- if you go back and you just lift the APA test -- because I believe Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right, that this is not an APA suit -- the word ‶ arguably ″ was inserted in the normal standing test by ADAPSO, which Justice Douglas wrote."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2258.086,2266.292,"I don't think so, Justice Breyer, because the zone of interest test requires the Court to determine what the purposes behind the statute are."
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.292,2267.311,But ‶ arguably ″.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2271.68,2280.702,"In the Lanham Act, I think the purposes of the Act are to protect those engaged in such commerce from unfair competition, from false statements."
2013.12-873,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2312.507,2317.244,What do you see as the difference between reasonable interest and zone of interest?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2324.981,2336.538,"--Justice Sotomayor, I believe the zone of interests can have some more teeth, perhaps, than the reasonable interest test because it tailors what is the interest protected to the text and history of the particular statute."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2356.119,2365.908,"Suppose that Lexmark had not made disparaging comments about Static Control, but had simply made false statements about its own product."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2377.199,2391.375,"So you would look at the subject matter of that false advertisement, and as you've expressed it I don't believe that Static Control's products would be within the subject matter about the vapor of Lexmark's printer cartridges."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.292,2421.994,Who would be within the zone of interest?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2427.798,2436.821,"In that situation, I think remanufacturers would and the supplier of toners that is necessarily by comparison talked about in that false advertisement."
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.2,2453.682,I understand.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2476.229,2484.235,"--If the Court wanted to get rid of the ‶ arguably ″ language for the purpose of the Lanham Act, we don't feel we have a dog in that fight, but I do believe--"
2013.12-873,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2484.235,2492.091,"Well, Mr. Jones, is the question that you are asking us to ask just, did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to sue?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2495.442,2496.226,--Yes.
2013.12-873,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2500.18,2502.196,Let's not call the limits anything in particular.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2517.673,2518.058,"--Yes, yes."
2013.12-873,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2531.116,2554.898,"But if that's correct, I mean, rather than talking about whether something is arguably within the zone of interests in the way we have to do in the APA context, because we are dealing with a lot of statutes that don't provide rights of action there, why shouldn't we just ask, what kinds of actors did the Lanham Act provide a right of action to as sensibly construed?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2559.385,2564.771,"I think that would be a very straightforward way to deal with this case, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-873,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2566.039,2566.506,And then what would be the test?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2568.408,2588.302,"--The Lanham Act means that those parties whose goodwill and commercial reputation is necessarily affected by the falsity of the statement have standing to sue, are protected by the Lanham Act and able to stop such false advertisements and able to seek recompense for the damages that are suffered."
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2605.831,2611.168,So what makes this limit a prudential limit?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2621.107,2628.029,"Justice Ginsburg, this Court has talked about these types of inquiries as prudential limits on standing."
2013.12-873,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2667.421,2693.556,"Could you tell me how that would affect a situation that I read about in the papers where a company like -- not to suggest that they have, but only using this as a hypothetical example -- McDonald's says in its advertising: We in fact, our calorie count is less than 200, so buy from us."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2710.35,2715.219,I think in that situation you would look to Burger King would have a cause of action.
2013.12-873,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2726.193,2748.308,"So fitting that into your definition of what ‶ standing ″ is, how do we not get it to be the local -- or maybe you say it's okay -- the local restaurant that has no franchises, that does healthy meals, which is actually true of many restaurants today, particularly in Washington?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2748.308,2748.808,Sure.
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.492,2852.043,"But now does that -- just thinking of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that suggests that maybe the reasonable interest test is okay, because what that's trying to do is -- you have McDonald's that's allegedly made the false statement, and then there are a range of people in terms more or less distant in respect to being direct competitors."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2899.191,2905.344,"If the Court were to adopt the reasonable interest test and explain it in those terms, I think we would be happy with that result."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2920.354,2922.104,"Well, it's not a reasonable interest test then."
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.104,2922.67,It isn't whether the interest is reasonable.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2943.033,2960.062,--And that is precisely why in our brief we do believe that it would be better for the Court to step back to that level and talk about the interests in protecting goodwill and commercial actors' standing in the marketplace vis a vis the subject matter of the false advertising.
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.062,2960.512,That may be better--
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.512,2961.764,Your zone of interests--
2013.12-873,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2961.764,2962.181,I'm sorry.
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.831,2972.703,"--Your zone of interest, in response to Justice Scalia, would establish another tier of zone of interest."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,2984.177,2998.104,"The Court said in Bennett v. Spear that how the zone of interest will apply will depend upon the text and history of the statute, and it will vary somewhat based upon the statutory text and context."
2013.12-873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.623,3028.739,--‶ Arguably ″ could refer to factual matters.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3053.357,3063.812,"And that understanding of the word, Justice Scalia, would fit with this Court's pleading rules and whether or not somebody has plausibly pled certain facts that would show that the test is met."
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.93,3068.397,What about--
2013.12-873,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3068.397,3084.892,"What I think, Mr. Jones, just a couple of years ago we made clear that ‶ arguably ″ was to be taken very seriously, and essentially established a kind of buffer zone so that if you kind -- we weren't going to be too strict about it."
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3120.082,3123.934,"Two responses to that, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-873,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3166.261,3175.384,Am I correct to think that your rule is that the only people who have standing under the Lanham Act are competitors and people whose products are disparaged?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3188.043,3198.982,Competition and competitors will line up in -- in a lot of ways with those who are affected by the subject matter of the suit.
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.057,3215.027,"--If it's who's affected, who specifically are we leaving out?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3257.688,3264.108,I'm not sure I know of any that have been left out that should not have been left out.
2013.12-873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3264.108,3264.408,All right.
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3277.851,3287.373,So one example that may clarify this with Justice Alito's question about competition is the Proctor & Gamble case that Mr. Loy talked about.
2013.12-873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3325.448,3333.688,Am I correct that no circuit has adopted the zone of interest test in the context of the Lanham Act?
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3333.688,3337.656,No circuit has adopted it as the test for the Lanham Act.
2013.12-873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3364.207,3370.294,"So what's wrong with the -- what is it -- AGC, the antitrust standard?"
2013.12-873,1,31125,jameson_r_jones,,3384.137,3393.392,"The experience -- Justice Ginsburg, the experience of the courts would show that applying agency actually would be more restrictive, I believe, than a zone of interest analysis."

2013.12-873,2,41676,steven_b_loy,,3446.161,3450.931,I have three short points.

2013.12-873,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3526.829,3527.265,Explain that.

2013.12-873,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3570.192,3576.329,"Well, was Title VII an APA -- when I asked Mr. Jones?"
2013.12-873,2,41676,steven_b_loy,,3576.329,3586.035,"If Title -- no, it was not an APA, but the language for standing that the Court analyzed is party affected or aggrieved."
