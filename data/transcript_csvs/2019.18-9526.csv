2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.76,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-9526, McGirt versus Oklahoma. Mr. Gershengorn."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,8.76,22.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is resolved by the fundamental proposition that decisions about sovereign rights are for Congress to make and Congress makes those decisions by speaking clearly in the text."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,135.04,135.8,"Counsel, the --"
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,135.8,136.88,So let me start this --
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,136.88,145.64,-- State argues that the territory should be analyzed as a dependent Indian community under 1151 and not as a reservation.
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,170.4,176.64,"So, Your Honor, I think both the precedent and the language support the idea that this is not a dependent Indian community."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,225.64,237.4,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.18-9526,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,237.4,238.28,"Yes, counsel."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,270.2,313.16,"So, Your Honor, I think the key point on -- the -- the -- the key point on the Parker/Solem analysis is, as your -- as Your Honor pointed out in that opinion, that those are not -- that that analysis doesn't derive from anything special about -- about how much work Congress is doing. The reason the Court has always required plain text is because treaty rights are at issue and plain text is required to abrogate treaty rights and because sovereign rights are at issue and plain text is required to abrogate sovereign rights. So there's nothing magic about Parker and Solem in terms of whether they're dealing with surplus lands or not."
2019.18-9526,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,360.6,369.4,"I don't mean to interrupt you, but I do want to get this point in, that in -- in Parker, we were only dealing with one allotment statute that was disposing of surplus land."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,380.12,381.44,"So I understand that, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.12,394.2,"Thank you. Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,394.2,397.48,-- deliberate action when this action dissolved --
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,397.48,398.2,Thank you. Justice Ginsburg?
2019.18-9526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.2,408.68,"Counsel, you don't claim immunity from prosecution for a major crime."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,415.52,418.56,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.56,446.96,"Federal penalties, as I understand it, are at least as harsh as the state and in both forms, state and federal, you would have due process protections. So how are you harmed by the fact that you were tried in the state court rather than the federal court when you were exposed to the same -- at least the same penalties in both?"
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,446.96,456.6,"So, Your Honor, I think the harm flows anytime that a defendant, a criminal defendant is tried by a sovereign that lacks jurisdiction."
2019.18-9526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.36,506.12,Counsel --
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,506.12,506.72,-- to reverse.
2019.18-9526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.72,519.12,"-- what makes this case hard is that there have been hundreds, hundreds of prosecutions, some very heinous offenses of the state law."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,563.6,566.52,"So, Your Honor, there are hundreds of case -- there may be hundreds of cases."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,587.2,588.84,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-9526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.08,594.76,"Good morning, counsel."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,626.92,634.56,"So, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the law is clear that Congress did not intend for crimes -- for tribal crimes to be tried."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.12,730.24,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?"
2019.18-9526,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,730.24,758.56,"You referred to the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but the language in that is that a case would be -- a case that was pending in the territorial court at the time of statehood would be sent to one of the new federal district courts or to one of the new state courts depending on where it would have been prosecuted if it had been prosecuted in a state. It doesn't say in a state in Indian Country."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,768.24,787.12,"So, Your Honor, I don't -- they -- treated like anyplace else, meaning it was subject to the Major Crimes Act. So I do -- I agree with you that there is no Oklahoma exceptionalism, but I think that cuts exactly in our favor. What Oklahoma is saying is that, uniquely among all the states in the union, it's exempt from the Major Crimes Act."
2019.18-9526,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,791.4,791.8,How about --
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,791.8,794.36,The language says --
2019.18-9526,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,794.36,812.36,"-- what it said in the 1897 statute, which said that ""the laws of the United States enforced in the territory shall apply to all persons therein, irrespective of race."" And yet you're saying that cases at the time of statehood would be treated based on race."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,818.96,833.52,"Because I think the 1897 Act, Your Honor, extends if -- what the U.S. -- the 1897 Act does is extend both U.S. law and -- and the Arkansas law, regardless of race. But it did not eliminate any language that was in the Major Crimes Act already."
2019.18-9526,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,857.08,870.32,What happened after -- what happened after statehood? Can you cite a single case under the Major Crimes Act that was transferred to or thereafter prosecuted in federal court?
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,870.32,871.16,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,875.4,877.16,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,877.16,878.8,-- what we never interpret criminal statutes to be --
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,878.8,879.28,I'm sorry.
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,879.28,880.72,-- what the executive --
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,880.72,885.48,"Counsel, thank you. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.18-9526,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,885.48,910.08,"Counsel, Justice Ginsburg pointed out that some of the penalties in federal court would be higher than those imposed in state court. Am I -- do you disagree that some defendants who might be entitled to raise -- if you were to win, some defendants who would be entitled to challenge their convictions would choose not to because the risk would be too high for them?"
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,910.08,912.64,"I think that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,960.52,966.16,"Number two, there's so much discussion about the dependent Indian community."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,972.12,973.24,It is almost irrelevant.
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.68,1011.4,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.18-9526,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1011.4,1017.64,"So, if I could pick up on that, Mr. Gershengorn, you said irrelevant and wrong."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1035.52,1037.88,So those -- it is consistent with our argument.
2019.18-9526,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1067.12,1070.48,"In other words, it's -- it's supposed to be an umbrella term that in --"
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1070.48,1072.44,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.44,1076.36,-- that integrates our standard reservations?
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1076.36,1077.12,Exactly.
2019.18-9526,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1080.0,1082.0,And how do we know that?
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1082.0,1119.4,"Because that's what the Court said in Sandoval, is that the -- is that -- that it was -- it was trying to figure out whether Congress had the power to legislate for the Pueblos, and -- and what it said was Congress has the power to legislate both domestic and -- old and new communities and use the term ""dependent Indian communities."" But, again, regardless, the Tribe has always -- the Creek have always been -- the reason the -- the Pueblos were compared to the Creek is because the Creek were assumed to be the quintessential reservation."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1130.64,1138.24,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.18-9526,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1138.24,1139.32,Hello?
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1139.32,1141.16,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.18-9526,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1141.16,1154.96,"Thank you, Chief. Counsel, we've heard a little bit about it today, but I'd -- I'd like to give you a chance to discuss further the argument that there are going to be terrible practical consequences that would follow from a ruling for your clients."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1175.96,1196.32,"So, Your Honor, I would -- broadly, here's what I would say: There are -- there -- there will, of course, be consequences from the Court's ruling, as there are from any of the Court's rulings, and those consequences are not trivial, but nor are they existential, nor, indeed, overly serious. But, more important, they are the kinds of consequences that happen routinely in Indian Country."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1266.72,1267.28,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-9526,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1267.28,1267.72,Thank you.
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.72,1269.6,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.18-9526,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1269.6,1273.56,"Thank you, Chief. And good morning, Mr. Gershengorn."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.8,1394.28,"Counsel, you have time for a very brief comment."
2019.18-9526,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1394.28,1404.04,"So I'll just say very briefly, Your Honor, after statehood, the -- 85 percent of the Indian territory remained in Indian hands, immune from taxation."
2019.18-9526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1423.6,1430.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanji."
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1430.96,1441.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to go straight to Justice Thomas's question about the governing framework here and make three points."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1497.4,1498.32,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1528.12,1530.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1578.36,1588.0,"But I -- I would like an answer to the precise question, which is the law would be different in eastern Oklahoma depending upon race, right?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1588.0,1595.0,"Well, under the Enabling Act, yes, the -- the transfer to the state was of cases that would arise under state law."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.96,1606.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.18-9526,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1606.0,1628.8,"Yes, Mr. Kanji, a brief question, and this is just -- it's not necessarily dispositive of this case, but I'm interested in your answer. Do you think a tribe can be effectively divested of title to land, to its land and its sovereignty, and still retain the status of reservation?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1632.0,1628.8,"It's a -- it's a critically interesting question, Your Honor. All -- all disestablishment cases involve a transformation of title."
2019.18-9526,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1708.6,1710.2,Thank you.
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.2,1714.0,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.18-9526,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.0,1761.0,"If you -- you are right, then what becomes of all the state tribal cooperative agreements that we're told about if the state lacks authority to apply its own law with increased territory, remaining as a cession to everything except what was given in the Civil War. Were all of the -- we're told that there are many, many state tribal cooperative agreements, but if the state lacks authority to apply its own law, what becomes of -- of all those state tribe cooperative agreements?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1761.0,1764.0,"The -- the agreements, Your Honor, will remain in full force and effect."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.5,1836.5,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer?"
2019.18-9526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.5,1866.0,"So I'm still interested in this claim the State makes that whether it's a reservation or not a reservation is beside the point, that all we have to decide here is whether Congress gave to a state court the power to try the state criminal crimes. And Felix Cohen points to three things where he thinks the answer to that question is yes, seems to."
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1930.0,1939.0,"I -- Your Honor, it would make my life much easier in this case if I could say there was plain text that had transferred jurisdiction to the state over the Indians."
2019.18-9526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.5,1943.0,No.
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1943.0,1945.0,But we simply can't find that text.
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1959.0,1974.0,Justice Alito? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?
2019.18-9526,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1974.0,1979.0,"Counsel, could you finish your answer to Justice Breyer, please?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,1979.0,1981.0,"Absolutely, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-9526,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2073.0,2109.0,"Counsel, could we go back to Justice Thomas's question? Am I to understand that in existing reservations outside of this Creek Nation issue, there are fee-simple possessions by non-Indians, non-Indians are living, working on those reservations? And am I to understand there's concurrent federal, state, and Indian jurisdiction over many of the issues involved with those people?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2109.0,2115.0,"Correct, Your Honor. Wherever there's fee-simple land in -- in a reservation, there is concurrent jurisdiction."
2019.18-9526,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2115.0,2117.0,So you really can't tie --
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.0,2120.0,"So, Justice Alito?"
2019.18-9526,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2120.0,2130.0,Am I correct that more than 90 percent of the people who live in the area directly affected by this case are not members of the Creek tribe?
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2130.0,2133.0,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2133.0,2153.0,"Well, what would you say to those people when we -- if we decide this case in your -- in your favor? Won't they be surprised to learn that they are living on a reservation and that they are now subject to laws imposed by a body that is not accountable to them in any way?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2153.0,2154.0,"There -- there are a number of responses, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2179.0,2201.0,"But what -- what would be the -- what will be the extent of the tribe's authority over these non-Indians? For example, if any member of the tribe has a contract dispute with a non-member, say it's about an employment contract or a lease or the purchase of goods, will the -- the tribal member be able to sue the non-Indian in tribal court under tribal law?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2201.0,2202.0,"In -- no, Your Honor."
2019.18-9526,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2224.7,2239.0,"Well, if this were a different reservation and a non-Indian chose to do business there, knew that he or she was entering a reservation, was doing business there, that would be considered to be consent, would it not?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2239.0,2242.6,"Well, the -- this Court's precedents are, honestly, a little unclear on that."
2019.18-9526,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2249.0,2249.5,But there will be --
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.5,2253.0,Justice Kagan?
2019.18-9526,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2253.0,2266.0,"Mr. Kanji, could I ask you to continue and -- you're talking about the consequences of this, and focus particularly about adoptions and foster care proceedings, because I know there's been some concern about that."
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2266.0,2270.0,"Thank you, Your Honor. There -- there's been some, well, frankly, rhetoric about that."
2019.18-9526,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2318.0,2326.0,"And with respect to all of these disruption questions, what role do you think that our decision in City of Sherrill plays?"
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2326.0,2336.0,"Well, I -- Sherrill has a -- has a -- Sherrill is always in the room when the states and the tribes are negotiating agreements."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2385.0,2387.0,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.18-9526,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2387.0,2412.0,"Counsel, there's been a fair amount of discussion so far this morning about the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the suggestion that it's inconceivable that Congress would have admitted a new state to the Union where a significant portion of the state would have been a federal reservation subject to the Major Crimes Act. And I'm not sure we've given you all a fair chance to have at that, so I'd -- I'd appreciate a thorough response to that question."
2019.18-9526,1,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,2412.0,2419.0,"Thank you, Justice Gorsuch. There's nothing inconsistent between the advent of statehood and reservation boundaries."
2019.18-9526,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2464.0,2466.0,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-9526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2466.0,2468.0,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.18-9526,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2468.0,2517.0,"Thank you, Chief Justice, and good morning. As I mentioned in the last comment, I think we have to understand what the situation was as of 1890, '90, to understand the text of these statutes, but I want to focus on the text, in particular, the text of the statute that abolishes the tribal courts and the text of the statute that creates, in essence, municipal towns within Indian territory during the 1890s and what the significance of those two statutes are for assessing sovereignty, because, ultimately, the question, as Justice Thomas suggested, I think, is what -- what's the status of legislative, executive, and judicial power. How should we think about those statutes with the tribal courts and the municipal towns?"

2019.18-9526,2,63240,mithun_mansinghani,,2908.92,2942.96,"So the tribe would have their governments in -- in that they would have control over their own internal affairs and managing their property interests, which, if you look to the tribal understanding at the time, as we -- as we quote in our Respondent's appendix, is exactly what the tribe understood their own authority to be. As far as would they have any authority over land, there is some land that is under their original fee patent, so the River Spirit Casino in Tulsa is built on the riverbed of the Arkansas River because that land was never allotted."

If you look at pages 23 -- 22 to 25 of our brief, we lay out that history and -- and lay out that that is what Congress said explicitly in legislative reports, that's what the Dallas Commission report said, and that's what the tribes recognize in their own tribal understanding."

The -- the tribe had fee ownership as part of setting aside the territory for its nation to be undisturbed, and the -- and the treaties provided that no territory or state would be created there. So, after all the non-Indians moved on to the territory, Congress concluded that was untenable and it had to break up the Nation, and that included both the fee and the -- and the sovereignty. And so what -- when Congress provided for allotment, the tribe specifically ceded its interest in the land, conveyed its interest in the land to the individuals."

So, if we were to look at the narrow question whether Congress has provided for the trial of cases like this one in state court, what would an opinion like that look like?

And that things got very complicated and they came mighty close to ending the reservation but never quite passed the kind of language that we typically see when that happens, reversion of all lands to the public domain or cessation or anything like that. In fact, the Dawes Commission couldn't -- admitted it couldn't quite get there."

And it was contemplated that Congress could pass laws governing the territory. I did want to make one point about practical consequences on the criminal side. Not only would -- would this jeopardize all the prior convictions on the state side, but it would impose great burdens on the federal government."

My understanding given the demographics as of 1890 was that it would be very hard to have a tribal government over the whole territory because of the population at the time. And my question is: What tribal authority, judicial authority, or legislative authority to your knowledge was exercised over the whole territory, including the white settlers, in 1890 through 1907?"
