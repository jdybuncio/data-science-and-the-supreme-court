1982.82-486,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.121,We'll hear arguments next in United Brotherhood of Carpenters against Scott and others.
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,64.144,70.112,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.013,172.932,"Mr. Gold, why would a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs file a suit under Section 1985(3) instead of a state tort action?"
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,177.898,189.377,"I am hard pressed to understand that myself, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.009,215.445,You think that would center around the recovery of attorney's fees question?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,215.445,244.979,"--That is, certainly in light of the Civil Rights Act attorney's fees statute, that could well be a motive, and the countervailing... why the plaintiffs were not impressed by the countervailing consideration that there are very, very difficult legal questions here and a straightforward tort case in the state court system, I am really not privy to--"
1982.82-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.979,255.132,"Well, I suppose in Beaumont, Port Arthur you have got elected judges and there might be some feeling that you do not get quite the same neutrality from elected judges as you do from lifetime federal judges."
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,255.132,295.162,"--There are also appellate judges in Texas up and down the system, and I can only say that there isn't a whisper in this record that the state justice system was not open to and fully protective of the rights and interests of plaintiff companies and non-union employees in the State of Texas."
1982.82-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.765,589.294,"Can you think of any more rights, Mr. Gold, that would fall on that side of the line that Justice Stevens drew?"
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,589.294,613.502,"From our view of the cases, Justice Rehnquist, we know of no other constitutional rights which are, of those stated in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment, which do no have a state action component to them."
1982.82-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.801,925.205,You do not think the right to work for a union employer stands on any different footing than the right to work for a non-union employer?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,925.205,925.486,No.
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,939.091,942.886,"Mr. Gold, I want to understand you."
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,969.75,977.998,He may have a right in some abstract sense of that term--
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,977.998,979.637,You think the state could forbid it?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,979.637,984.183,--Could the... I apologize--
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,984.183,994.991,Could the state enact a statute that said everyone who seeks employment in this state must seek non-union employment?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,994.991,1002.128,--I do not think that the First Amendment--
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1002.128,1005.845,Would any provision in the Constitution forbid that?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1005.845,1013.28,--Whether substantive due process would return--
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1013.28,1014.857,"You would not like it, would you?"
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1014.857,1015.701,--No.
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1123.689,1131.201,But I was wondering about the right of an individual to make a choice as to where he wishes to work and with and for whom.
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1131.201,1147.022,I do not believe that an individual has such a constitutional right under the First Amendment.
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1147.726,1150.083,Under any provision of the Constitution--
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1150.083,1151.021,--I know of no provision.
1982.82-486,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1151.021,1154.879,--This sounds like the Soviet Union to me where they tell you where you can work and where you cannot.
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1156.816,1160.346,I was wondering about that.
1982.82-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.84,1608.71,"Mr. Gold, what if say up in Vermont the natives of Vermont have the same attitude toward Democrats that many Southerners at that time had towards the Republicans."
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1616.348,1618.395,The--
1982.82-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.395,1620.331,"Nothing to do with freedmen, obviously."
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1620.331,1620.737,--No.
1982.82-486,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1712.92,1715.293,Would illegitimates be such a class?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1715.293,1727.132,"--Under this Court's cases in the development of Fourteenth Amendment law, that might be."
1982.82-486,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1750.123,1752.48,"Discrete, insular--"
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1752.48,1767.349,"--Right, and is the animus against either the people of that class or those who were assisting members of that class to enjoy the full panoply of rights stated in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments."
1982.82-486,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.349,1770.958,"--Mr. Gold, the Slaughterhouse case set a law there, did it not?"
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1770.958,1772.614,If it--
1982.82-486,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1772.614,1778.813,"Nobody pays any attention to it any more, but that is an awful clear language in that."
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1778.813,1788.201,"--We have pondered whether that case throws light on it, and in a sense--"
1982.82-486,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.201,1789.185,Do you think it is just dead?
1982.82-486,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1789.185,1792.559,--We are not sure.
1982.82-486,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.559,1794.667,I might breathe some life in it.
1982.82-486,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1794.667,1799.587,Mr. Keith.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,1799.587,1801.867,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.75,1941.766,"Counsel, isn't Texas a right-to-work state?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,1941.766,1942.016,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.438,1949.824,"I have trouble with your argument about it, so well organized by labor unions."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,1949.824,1963.396,"The record shows, Your Honor, that in this particular geographic locality, and all of the evidence is that the labor movement and particularly in the construction trades, is very, very pervasive."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.883,2087.223,What did it deprive them of?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2088.502,2110.135,"Best said, it deprived us, if I may code myself as a plaintiff for the moment... it deprived us of the equal enjoyment of personal security which all of us enjoy under the law."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.135,2116.133,Do you think 1985(3) covers that?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2116.133,2121.162,"Yes, sir, and I believe the Court's decision in Griffin and the legislative history will support that."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.224,2124.364,How does Griffin have gotten to the Thirteenth Amendment case?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2124.364,2138.154,"--Griffin was at least a Thirteenth Amendment case and a right to travel case, and Griffin spoke in this instance of a class-based invidiously discriminatory animus."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.154,2139.717,You always have to have that.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2139.717,2143.653,"Yes, sir, but that is the right that is violated."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.917,2150.571,"Tell me again, what right is it?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2151.665,2159.412,"In this case I have, we have the right to enjoy equally the security from unprovoked attack."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.803,2168.862,So 1985(3) covers any assault that is performed by two people?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2168.862,2169.69,"--No, sir, not at all."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.265,2174.562,If they just attacked red-headed people?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2174.562,2185.558,"--If there is a class-based invidiously discriminatory animus that is both pervasive as in... to extent and intensity, yes."
1982.82-486,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.558,2187.088,Class basis on both sides?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2187.088,2191.476,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, but there must be a conspiracy."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.755,2211.11,So you do not think there is any necessity for the conspiracy to interfere with the efforts of the state to protect people?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2211.11,2211.532,That is correct.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.336,2236.724,Eighty-five three says equal protection.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2236.724,2240.004,"Yes, sir, or enjoyment of equal privileges and immunities."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.004,2244.378,"Well, so you will claim under immunities?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2244.378,2247.798,"We claim in this instance, sir, under--"
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.798,2249.938,You cannot claim equal protection.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2249.938,2251.265,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.265,2252.765,"Well, where is the state?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2254.154,2254.841,We do not claim--
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.841,2260.386,"Well, where did you get equal protection from if you did not get it from the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2260.386,2266.431,"--The Congress, Your Honor, did not say equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.179,2270.179,But you say equal protection of the law--
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2270.179,2271.022,"--That is correct, yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2271.022,2277.832,--and the only place you find that in the Constitution is in the Fourteenth Amendment.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2277.832,2278.286,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.286,2278.786,Isn't that correct?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2278.786,2279.956,That is my understanding.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.956,2283.705,So they took it from the Fourteenth Amendment.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2283.705,2285.876,They took the concept of equal--
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.876,2288.235,But they left the state in the Fourteenth Amendment.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2288.235,2290.546,--They left the state in the Fourteenth Amendment.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.546,2292.123,They just took the equal protection and left the state.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2292.123,2310.46,"Now, there is a view supported by the legislative history that at the time Congress enacted this that they thought they were enacting a statute under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section Five, but we do not need to reach that in this case."
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.828,2372.654,"Well, Mr. Keith, how do you get... I have the same basic question Mr. Justice Marshall had."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2381.883,2390.521,"Sir, it is not that you were deprived, thus injured, thus you have a cause of action."
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.968,2407.233,But I want to get back to the Fourteenth.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2413.981,2414.309,None.
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.309,2417.041,"Well, then what is the authority for Congress to act?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2417.041,2418.666,In this instance the commerce clause.
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.666,2423.492,You say Congress relied on the commerce clause in passing 1985?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2423.492,2426.007,At this time--
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.007,2429.443,"You mean then 1983, the present--"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2429.443,2430.473,"--Today, yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.707,2434.816,--I am talking about 1871.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2434.816,2449.279,"--At the time Congress adopted 1985, their perception was that this was a wrong that needed correcting and that they had the authority to do so under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1982.82-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.255,2474.861,But there is not the slightest indication from the legislative debates that I have seen in 1871 that Congress gave any thought to the commerce clause.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2474.861,2475.986,--That is correct.
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.986,2487.42,"And if they had given some thought to it, they could not possibly have imagined that the commerce clause would authorize this kind of an interference with it."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2487.42,2490.075,"As I understand the test today, sir--"
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.075,2492.62,"No, but as of that time."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2492.62,2504.99,"--The commerce clause was given a more restrictive application 100 years ago, yes, but the question today is the constitutionality of the Act and the authority of Congress to enact it."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.99,2510.114,"No, the question is construing the statute they read."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2510.114,2511.316,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.316,2520.64,"And if they purported to act under the Fourteenth Amendment, I am sure they thought they were complying with, they were staying within its limits."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2528.029,2528.747,"No, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.851,2540.507,Under what authority?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2540.507,2544.443,"Under the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress says--"
1982.82-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.443,2545.084,All right.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2563.529,2571.417,"--That was the type of question that was subject to the debate, exactly."
1982.82-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2607.091,2620.474,"--Mr. Keith, would just any group that shared common political or social beliefs qualify for the class of plaintiffs that you would see covered by the statute?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2620.474,2621.911,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2651.806,2655.991,So to define the class we look in the minds of the defendants to see--
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2655.991,2667.97,"--As represented by their res gestae statements at the time and as represented by their conspiratorial actions before and in the acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, yes."
1982.82-486,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2712.235,2719.279,"--Mr. Keith, under your view would a private men's club be subject to a 1985(3) suit by women?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2719.279,2728.509,No.
1982.82-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2728.509,2730.634,If the women thought they were inferior?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2730.634,2735.226,No.
1982.82-486,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.478,2771.289,"Well, instead of women suppose it is blacks."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2771.289,2779.238,If they are beaten and assaulted because of that status--
1982.82-486,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2779.238,2781.082,No they are just denied--
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2781.082,2781.519,--Excluded--
1982.82-486,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.519,2785.267,--excluded from the white male club.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2785.267,2792.186,--I do not perceive that as the animus conceived by the--
1982.82-486,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2792.186,2799.199,"The original purpose I gather... animus initially was in part at least the freedmen, was it not?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2799.199,2813.583,"--Yes, sir, in part the freedmen, but it was basically economic in that the Northerner, the Vermonter, the freedman was now taking over the place or taking a place in this new economic order."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.894,2821.674,You keep talking about economic and all.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2832.154,2833.061,"Yes, sir, they were."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.061,2834.279,Don't tell me you never heard of them.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2834.279,2834.888,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.949,2839.449,Is that not the reason for this statute?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2839.449,2841.495,"--Yes, sir, but what was happening was--"
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.495,2844.604,"Your people do not qualify under that, do they?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2844.604,2854.364,"--What was happening was that the Northerner was going to the South, was being elected to the legislature, was operating stores."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.909,2861.362,In '71?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2861.362,2870.295,"Yes, sir, and that is exactly what the legislative history spoke to was the conduct toward the black man and toward these new persons in the community."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.295,2872.951,How come none of the early cases mentioned it?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2877.325,2880.916,"Well, respectfully, there are just two."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.916,2882.697,Just two?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2884.337,2886.306,Well--
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.306,2887.617,In one volume.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2887.617,2888.663,--Speaking of the--
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2888.663,2891.616,I think either three or four.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2891.616,2901.019,"--Griffin since 1962 is the only time that this Court has really written on this 1985(3), and those men--"
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.019,2907.639,The whole point is you have got a clear almost undefendable action in the state court.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2908.983,2912.029,"--There is an action in the state court, yes, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2912.029,2914.872,You are going to have a dual recovery here?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2914.872,2915.247,"No, sir."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.247,2916.823,Sir?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2916.823,2918.432,"No, sir, not in any way."
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.432,2919.541,Are you going to drop your state one?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2919.541,2921.322,I have never brought a state court suit.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.322,2921.838,Sir?
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2921.838,2924.743,I never brought this as a state court suit.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.743,2927.414,I thought you said there were two involved in this same one.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2932.099,2935.082,My plaintiffs in this case brought one law suit and that was in this Court.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.082,2938.097,"Yes, but you could have brought it in the state court."
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2938.097,2940.33,We could have brought a law suit in the state court.
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.408,2947.983,"Now, to get back to Justice O'Connor's question before, why the federal instead of the state court?"
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2947.983,2953.184,Am I free to answer that question as the lawyer who brought the case?
1982.82-486,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.7,2993.839,And it was easier.
1982.82-486,1,39660,robert_q_keith,,2993.839,2996.135,"--Well, it has not been easy."
1982.82-486,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3542.277,3544.37,I have nothing further unless there are questions.
1982.82-486,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3544.37,3544.761,"Thank you, gentlemen."
