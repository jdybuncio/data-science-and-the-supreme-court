2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,35.125,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-358, the Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,62.838,66.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.392,232.404,"Mr. Kneedler, just a... a background fact."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,249.054,249.435,There was.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.153,373.394,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a question?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,391.088,391.659,"Oh, yes, yes."
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.519,404.578,It wouldn't be any different.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,405.359,405.44,"--No, no."
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.63,406.792,--I thought you were saying it's--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,408.381,408.581,--The same.
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.842,408.992,"Oh, well--"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,408.992,409.753,That's what I... I'm sorry.
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.753,410.965,--You scared me for a minute.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,410.965,411.165,"No, no."
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.44,439.674,"But... but in either event, it would not have been the kind of major Federal action that must be preceded by an EIS."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,439.674,439.895,That's correct.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.895,440.783,That's your basic position.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,440.783,441.575,That's... that's correct.
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.654,475.929,"Well, but... but it wouldn't be a question of second guessing, would it, if the agency regulations in question could reduce somehow the... the impact that the... the known action by the President, who's pretty sure this was going to happen, would cause?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,498.663,500.926,Two things I'd like to say about that.
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.175,540.092,"No, but I mean, my point is it... it seems to me obvious that you don't have to evaluate in an environmental impact statement something that you have no power--"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,540.092,540.523,Right.
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.523,542.413,--to... to remedy.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,542.413,542.764,Right.
2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.49,569.323,When did respondents first make this point?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,570.705,584.025,"The... the first place that this point... I mean, it was really just in a sentence... was in a reply brief in the court of appeals that they... that they... that they... they said that the agency might have been... been able to come up with some modified version of... of the regulations."
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.543,599.947,"--Well, Mr. Kneedler, on... on that... going to that point, I mean, that goes to something Justice Scalia raised and I wanted to raise it too."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,616.706,617.177,--Right.
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.177,625.714,"And... and I'm looking... by the way, I'm on page... what is it... 2a of... of your brief where you set out the statute down at the bottom of the page, Roman (i)."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,683.695,693.121,"Well, respondents have not relied on that provision, but... but my... my understanding of that is that that refers... that refers to effects that... that are within the agency's control."
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,722.265,733.651,"But if... if that's the... if... if the... if... I'll call it (C)(ii) here... is... is being read in that way, then I take it what it means... let's forget the presidential action here."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,764.092,764.132,Right.
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.132,765.534,Is... is that fair to say?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,765.534,771.52,And... and I was just going to say there is a separate requirement under the... CEQ has elaborate regulations that... that flesh this out.
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.839,789.171,Then why doesn't that apply here?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,789.171,793.854,"--Because the... the... first of all, the agency did that."
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.408,799.798,But I'm talking about the cumulative effect.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,801.841,802.001,--It... it--
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.001,809.567,"I thought under the Council of Environmental Quality reg, at some point they had to take into effect... they had to disclose the cumulative effect."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,809.567,812.409,"--Well, if you mean... if you mean with the... the--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,812.409,814.931,The effect of all the agencies together in my hypothesis.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,828.454,828.604,"--Yes, and... and--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.604,829.014,--the cumulation.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,829.014,830.897,"--Right, and... and what... what the--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,830.897,832.597,So why wasn't it done here?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,832.597,845.175,"--Well, the... the agency here was the only one taking action, and all the cumulative impact requirement requires it to do is to isolate what its incremental contribution will be--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,845.175,856.255,"Well, that's under Roman (i), but under Roman (ii) it's broader, and you said, I thought, under the Council on Environmental Quality regs, at some point you've got to disclose the cumulative effect of all of it."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,863.321,863.561,"--Well, if... if there are--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.561,865.153,--and why wasn't it done here?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,865.153,869.337,"--If there are... if there are two agencies working in tandem... see, the... again, the President--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.337,869.567,So you're saying--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,869.567,870.338,--the President--
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.338,873.971,--it... it would have been done here but for the fact that the President is not an agency.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,873.971,879.535,"--If two agencies... if two agencies are taking parallel action, they are supposed... or coordinated action, they're supposed to coordinate the--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,879.535,882.636,"Right, and you're saying because the President is not an agency, that doesn't apply here."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,882.636,882.787,--Right.
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.478,901.609,"Now, does the... does the Council on Environmental Quality regulation say that the... that the disclosure of cumulative effect depends upon the action of many agencies as opposed to the actions of many persons to which an agency contributes?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,901.609,904.422,--It is... it is... it's addressed--
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,904.422,905.673,"Yes, but what is it?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,905.673,907.085,--more... it... it includes more--
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.085,907.215,But is it--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,907.215,909.729,"--It's not just limited to other agencies, but there's an--"
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.729,911.679,--Then why didn't it apply here?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,918.083,922.888,--The agency did comply by saying this is the context in which we were acting.
2003.03-358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.712,926.303,Yes.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,926.303,927.414,--literally the language there.
2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.189,1078.301,Did 350 limit itself in its directions to the agency to safety matters?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1078.301,1078.451,Yes.
2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.054,1107.385,Mr. Kneedler?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1107.385,1108.336,--stringent qualifications.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.336,1111.769,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you another kind of preliminary question?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1128.342,1130.455,"Yes, because it... it--"
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.455,1134.547,Because if I'm an agency--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1134.547,1137.198,--They kept it... the duty... the duty is imposed on the agency.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.121,1139.902,--I see.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1139.902,1142.072,And the agency shall include in it--
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.072,1146.635,It should read any major Federal action undertaken by the agency--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1146.635,1146.784,--Yes.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.784,1147.215,--is implicitly--
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1147.215,1153.95,Because it says include in every... the agency in... in the introductory part shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals or major Federal action.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.205,1159.676,--And... and we've held that?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1163.361,1170.585,"I don't know that this Court has ever specifically addressed it, but I think that's been the common understanding."
2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.274,1252.77,"Well, in fact, an agency could produce an EIS that said what we propose to do is disastrous and nevertheless go ahead, could it not?"
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1252.77,1252.99,"Yes, yes."
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.347,1353.72,That is... that is set forth in the regulations?
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1353.72,1353.89,--Yes.
2003.03-358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.329,1398.403,"Mr.... Mr. Kneedler, I... I read the regs the same way you do."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1452.99,1456.529,The... the regulations are an interpretation of the statute the--
2003.03-358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.529,1456.93,"Yes, yes."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1456.93,1479.216,"--that the agency adopted through notice and comment rulemaking, and the... the preamble to that regulation contains a very extensive and persuasive discussion by EPA about why it's necessary to draw a line between the things that... for which a Federal agency can be reasonably held accountable or responsible and those for which the... after all, the States are primarily responsible in developing--"
2003.03-358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.216,1479.727,Yes.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1479.727,1481.487,--implementation plans.
2003.03-358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.569,1513.31,But they would have to disclose it.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1530.123,1533.756,"--Well, I suppose under the broadest reading, but I think even that might... might be a extensive reading of the regulation."
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.08,1538.27,I know.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1556.784,1561.756,"I... it... it could voluntarily do that, but the... but the... the case law--"
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.756,1562.377,No.
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1574.758,1574.918,--No.
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.848,1588.177,"--Which the converse of that is that even if you're right, conceivably... I mean, even if your basic concern is right that the trucks should come in, conceivably the duty to prepare the statement might remain."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1588.177,1593.059,--NEPA has... has not been interpreted that way over the years where an--
2003.03-358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.059,1596.232,"But this... this case involves the President, so it's a very unusual case."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1596.232,1608.23,"--But... but even in the non-presidential case where an agency does not have discretion, because the EIS is designed to inform the agency's decision-making power, and if it really has no... no latitude in its decision-making, it would be essentially pointless to prepare it."
2003.03-358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.23,1618.388,"Yes, but assuming it was an agency that had some discretion in the matter, my understanding is it... it can't go ahead without first making the environmental impact statement."
2003.03-358,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1618.388,1632.706,"No, that's true, but... but we do think that there is some room for remedial discretion where... where even if there's a violation, the... not to mention the... the principle of prejudicial error under the APA that if there's... if there's a defect, it doesn't always have to result in setting it aside."
2003.03-358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.887,1635.749,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1638.19,1641.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.37,1668.162,But this wasn't your argument.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1692.539,1698.593,The... the argument is that because Congress promulgated section 350--
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.593,1698.914,Right.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1698.914,1703.388,--no trucks can come in until the agency makes these safety choices.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.388,1703.628,Okay.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1710.575,1711.025,That is correct.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.167,1713.647,"Now, just let me ask."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1770.003,1772.106,--The... the question--
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.106,1777.442,"Concerning, you know, what the environmental impact of the... of the mad millionaire's actions are going to be?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1777.442,1780.962,--The... the only question is whether the... first... there are two questions.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.516,1788.519,"Has no control over the mad millionaire, just as this agency has no control over the President."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1788.519,1793.925,"--If... if the... if the... if it comes down to foreseeability, when the agency takes--"
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.925,1795.264,The mad millionaire put it in writing.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1803.43,1811.398,--The... the critical point is... is whether the agency has a choice about the... the options that it is going to take.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.99,1816.2,It does.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1819.051,1819.231,--Right.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.688,1828.497,So the FCC would have to do an EIS in this situation.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1828.497,1830.029,"--In that situation, that is correct."
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.029,1830.199,That's absurd.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1830.199,1830.51,But that--
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.51,1830.69,Fine.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1893.052,1894.642,--The... the reason is this.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.507,1903.239,And so does the Post Office.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1923.402,1928.124,--Because it's... it's what Congress... it's how Congress set up the... the situation.
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.465,1991.379,"Now, was this basis for the Ninth Circuit decision?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,1991.379,1994.859,--I... I believe this was the basis for the Ninth Circuit decision.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.582,2001.463,But... but in... in--
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2028.13,2032.053,--It really is very similar to the Robertson scenario.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.339,2041.129,"Yes, but the permit could have forbidden the action."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2066.09,2067.722,"Justice Scalia, the... the difference--"
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.722,2072.854,They... they were not part of the... of the program to decide whether the ski resort is going to be built.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2072.854,2078.146,--The... the difference here is that the agency has significant choices to make about safety.
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2087.053,2101.395,"No, but can't the... isn't the agency's discretion to determine whether older trucks come in or not a discretion which is supposed to be exercised on the basis of safety considerations rather than environmental considerations?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2101.395,2109.883,"--But that's the point of NEPA, that... what NEPA says is just because you have a safety agency doesn't mean it can divorce its safety considerations from the environment."
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.584,2116.738,Those safety considerations that are within its control that would be affected by its safety regulations are minimal.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2141.296,2150.823,"--That's part of it, but the... but it's also true that what the agency does can... can have a huge effect in terms of how many trucks are actually going to come over."
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.574,2186.429,"Well, don't... don't the rules have to be such that American trucks and Mexican trucks are treated alike?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2186.429,2199.068,I... there's... actually the... the arbitral panel in NAFTA specifically said that the U.S. could treat Mexican trucks differently than U.S. trucks as long as it has a good reason.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.298,2200.478,It doesn't.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2205.964,2207.323,--We're for environment.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.323,2207.764,So if in fact... yes.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2233.305,2234.486,Yes.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.486,2236.897,Was that your position in front of the agency?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2236.897,2238.598,The agency does have that... that power.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.48,2239.68,All right.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2244.024,2249.707,"--If... if the agency takes major action with respect to emissions of U.S. trucks, yes."
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.707,2249.767,"No, no."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2284.581,2292.966,"No, because the agency rulemakings that we challenge deal solely with the... with... with trucks coming over from Mexico."
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.303,2321.746,Were... were these points pressed on the agency during the proceedings?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2321.746,2322.765,The... the agency--
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.765,2324.217,Can you answer yes or no?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2324.217,2324.727,--Yes.
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.727,2325.438,Okay.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2325.438,2331.713,"The... there were numerous comments to the agency about safety, and the agency, as I mentioned before--"
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.713,2336.455,But to say there were numerous comments about safety doesn't certainly answer my question.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2336.455,2344.102,--The... the agency said that it was going to target high-risk trucks to be in compliance with safety and environmental laws.
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.517,2352.668,Well--
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2362.524,2363.335,The... right.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.58,2369.55,Knew... knew what?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2369.55,2370.872,The agency knew that there was a--
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.872,2374.315,That... that high-risk trucks are what?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2374.936,2381.691,"--The... the agency knew that... that older trucks are both less safe and more polluting, that there's a correlation--"
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.691,2383.772,Between pollution and age.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2383.772,2385.615,--And... and that... and it specifically--
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.615,2391.407,And was that brought to the agency's attention as one of the things that they should take into account in... in their safety rules?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2391.407,2397.261,--The... the agency had it... said it in its environmental assessment and what I just said.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.197,2418.486,"The agency did take it into account in its environmental assessment and concluded that there was no significant environmental impact just from the content of its rules, and therefore they didn't have to do an EIS."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2442.752,2448.986,"Yes, both that and the choices that the agency makes which will determine not only whether any trucks come in but how many."
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.986,2448.996,Not the choices alone.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2465.248,2468.531,We absolutely did... did make that claim in... in--
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.531,2468.7,--All right.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2504.099,2506.55,"--If I could, I'd like to start with the Ninth Circuit."
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.705,2512.075,"No, no."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2514.988,2515.349,Okay.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.349,2519.202,"I mean, where... where before the agency was it raised?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2519.202,2525.867,"The... the agency, as I said, agreed there's this correlation between safety and the environment."
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.447,2554.627,All right.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2564.844,2566.086,You said it much better than I could.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.306,2566.987,Okay.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2586.07,2587.322,The answer is yes.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.322,2587.763,I know you think--
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2587.763,2587.933,Because--
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.933,2588.083,--it's yes.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2589.295,2589.896,--Yes.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.896,2592.337,--and try to... try to figure out whether it is yes.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2592.337,2593.048,Because--
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.048,2593.769,What... what... go ahead.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2593.769,2595.74,"--Because... thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.569,2628.782,"Well, why did... why did you wait until the petition for rehearing in the Ninth... Ninth Circuit to raise it before that court?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2628.782,2630.114,It wasn't rehearing.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.331,2642.044,What... here is... here's what the Ninth Circuit said.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2694.68,2709.629,"The... and the Ninth Circuit also said that the... the environmental assessment was inadequate for, quote, not considering additional alternatives such as, for example, proposing more stringent controls on incoming Mexican trucks."
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.141,2751.307,"Yes, it's true that the Ninth Circuit said just what you said it said, but it was quoting the general requirement, I think, which exists in the way you describe it."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2776.082,2776.082,The... I'm not quite sure I understand the question.
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.082,2780.465,"Remember, what we're talking about now is the agency is considering alternative A, B, or C."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2822.202,2825.125,The... the agency--
2003.03-358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.125,2825.786,I think that's--
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2825.786,2835.063,--issued the... the environmental assessment and then asked for comment on it after it had already issued the interim final rules.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.406,2889.735,--Does this agency have the authority to exclude a perfectly safe truck because in its view it's an older truck and will pollute more?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2892.278,2895.481,The agency is to make safety choices.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.481,2896.472,Safety choices.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2896.472,2901.326,And in doing that it's... under NEPA must take a hard look at the environmental effect on the safety choices.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.326,2901.497,No.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2925.503,2930.117,The... the agency is not required to let any truck in.
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.779,2936.191,"That's true, but it has to exclude it on the basis of safety considerations."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2936.191,2936.552,--That is correct.
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2961.02,2976.241,"Are... are you saying that because there are varying environmental effects as between old trucks and new trucks, the agency's obligation is to find a safety hook in order to keep out the old rather than the new?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2976.241,2978.532,--The... no.
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2980.442,2991.962,"And we'll... we'll find that the... you know, the signal lights don't work quite so well on the old trucks and we'll use that as a basis to keep them out so there... so we can minimize environmental damage?"
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,2991.962,2996.826,--The agency does not have that obligation because NEPA does not require substantive decisions.
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3001.518,3001.758,All right.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3056.376,3063.201,"Yes, as long as the agency has... has a significant choice to make about what the standards should be."
2003.03-358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3063.201,3070.036,"Suppose under Justice Souter's question, the agency has no choice and it must let in the trucks."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3072.469,3074.54,If the agency has no choice--
2003.03-358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3074.54,3075.111,Or the EA.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3075.111,3085.628,"--then... then under a number of circuit court cases, which the Government cited, the agency would not have to do it."
2003.03-358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3089.63,3089.9,No.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3134.033,3136.324,That... I think that is accurate about where we are.
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3218.589,3219.971,Did... did you challenge the regs?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3219.971,3222.545,"--We... we did not challenge the regs, but we read the regs--"
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3222.545,3223.744,Isn't that the end of the issue?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3223.744,3226.696,"--No, because we read the regs very differently than the agency."
2003.03-358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.834,3235.324,Where... where are you?
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3239.338,3244.243,--Actually the... the critical... the critical regulation that the Government raised was in its reply brief.
2003.03-358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3332.233,3337.786,I thought they were relying on the regulation on page 8a of the Government's principal brief.
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3364.366,3369.071,"That's right, and the regulation I've just read is the definition of continuing program responsibility."
2003.03-358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3399.153,3422.027,"Well, I... I guess that any... any Federal licensing agency for... for automobiles or anything else would... would come within this and would have to... you know, if I don't issue a license, I can practicably control the... the amount of emissions, even though the agency is not a... an emissions approving agency."
2003.03-358,1,33472,jonathan_weissglass,,3424.088,3429.363,The... the... this is the tradeoff that Congress made in requiring States to meet clean air requirements.

2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3501.244,3508.57,They did not... they did not... what... what they're really arguing is that the agency should have considered some other alternative.
2003.03-358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3539.194,3542.156,--They're... they're making basically the argument you said they waived.
2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3542.156,3542.806,--Yes.
2003.03-358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3542.806,3545.088,"You know, I mean, that's been pretty much our whole discussion."
2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3561.268,3561.488,But--
2003.03-358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3561.488,3562.888,"But you're saying, well, they never made that point."
2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3562.888,3563.059,--Right.
2003.03-358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3563.059,3569.764,"They said, but it's so obvious we didn't have to make it, and besides, when we got to the Ninth Circuit, at least in the reply brief, we did make it."
2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3569.764,3569.945,Yes.
2003.03-358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3570.876,3571.026,All right.
2003.03-358,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3572.157,3579.994,"--The... the... first of all, the agency... the agency did an EA in order to determine it didn't have to produce an environmental impact statement."
