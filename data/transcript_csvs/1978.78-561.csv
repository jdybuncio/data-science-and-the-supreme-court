1978.78-561,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.247,"We'll hear arguments next in number 561, United States against Naftalin."
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,55.817,59.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-561,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,258.382,264.402,"Mr. Shapiro, could this case have been prosecuted under the 1934 Act?"
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,264.402,265.519,"It could indeed, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.184,279.13,Would it have made your position a little easier here had it --
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,279.13,280.322,We don't feel that it would.
1978.78-561,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.111,410.027,"The District Court so found and the Court of Appeals intimated that it agreed on the factual issue, didn't it?"
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,410.027,410.931,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.59,419.626,"Who was the district judge, Judge Larson?"
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,419.626,421.97,"Yes, Your Honor, Judge Larson."
1978.78-561,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.574,589.116,"Mr. Shapiro, do you have to delve very deeply into the legislative history if the statute is quite clear on its face?"
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,589.116,592.438,I agree with Your Honor that you don't have to even scratch the surface.
1978.78-561,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.299,602.016,I realize the Court of Appeals took a different view.
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,602.016,602.591,That's correct.
1978.78-561,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,991.138,992.331,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1978.78-561,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,992.331,994.432,Thank you.
1978.78-561,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.432,1005.118,Mr. Walters.
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1005.118,1012.504,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1118.964,1124.133,"What difference does this make to the central issue, Mr. Walters?"
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1124.133,1130.407,"I think it makes this difference, Your Honor, as to whether or not this case would be before this Court here today."
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.555,1168.087,"Well, the only issue before us is whether he is properly charged under 17 (a) (1)."
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1168.087,1170.689,"Now, that we're here -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.935,1254.791,"Well, Mr. Walters, why does it make any difference which “species of fraud,” as you put it, he engaged in when 17 (a) (1) makes criminal the employment of any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud?"
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1254.791,1271.317,"It is our contention that the 1933 Act was directed towards the purchaser of securities, that it dealt with the offer or the sale of securities to the purchasers."
1978.78-561,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.464,1364.382,"But your client wasn't convicted of short selling, he was convicted of fraud."
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1364.382,1374.067,He was -- he was convicted of a species of fraud and I am directing the Court's attention to what is the fraud that he committed.
1978.78-561,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.098,1402.414,But you concede that he did engage in fraud?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1402.414,1424.928,"I concede that he engaged in fraud in obtaining an illegal extension of credit, and I say that that is in violation of the 1934 Act and that it is not encompassed within Section 17 (a) of the 1933 Act."
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.332,1539.856,"Mr. Walters, before you leave 17 (a), do you concede that the short sale was an offer or sale of a security within the meaning of the opening paragraph of 17 (a) (1)?"
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1543.675,1544.758,"No, I do not."
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.865,1546.957,Would you say there was no offer or sale in the case?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1546.957,1550.916,"There was no offer or sale to the broker, that's correct."
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.916,1556.155,"Well, but -- forget to the broker for a moment, because the statute doesn't have those in it."
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1567.334,1572.066,My client employed a broker to make a sale of some securities.
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.066,1573.435,So you do concede there was an offer?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1573.435,1576.644,"Through his agent, he sold securities and they were delivered."
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.644,1583.008,"I -- so you concede there was an offer of sale of securities and do you also concede there was a device, scheme or artifice to commit fraud?"
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1583.008,1585.037,No.
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.613,1602.65,But you do concede there was a sale?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1602.65,1612.43,"There was a sale to a customer and the securities were delivered to the customer and the customer paid his money for it and the brokerage house that represented the respondent hung onto the money, that's correct."
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.43,1618.696,So your -- what your basic – your statutory argument is that the words “deceit upon the purchaser” should be read into the entire section?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1618.696,1619.305,That is correct.
1978.78-561,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.305,1620.018,Statutory --
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1620.018,1653.059,"I maintain that under the 1933 Act that the deceit on the purchaser should be read into subdivision (1) and subdivision (2) and subdivision (3) and I point out that if you look at Section 12 and you look at Section 11 of the 1933 Act, you will find it is only the purchaser that has standing to bring a cause of action for fraud, deception or anything in violation of the 1993 Act."
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.383,1754.669,"But subsection (1) doesn't say anything about the purchaser, does it?"
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1754.669,1762.232,"It -- it doesn't, but if you read (1) and you read (2) and you get down to (3) at the end, it talks about fraud on the purchaser."
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.232,1763.742,Isn't each one of them independent?
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1763.742,1764.812,I don't believe so.
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.495,1951.371,Thank you.
1978.78-561,1,33700,joe_a_walters,,1954.473,1955.568,I'm finished Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-561,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.568,1957.277,"Very well, Mr. Walters."
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1959.534,1961.284,"Just briefly, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.887,2015.902,"Mr. Shapiro, it is true, is it not, that if you read Judge Larson's opinion, he does refer to sale in each paragraph, and his next to concluding paragraph says they prove beyond a reasonable doubt that -- I have lost the language now, but he refers to fraud in the sale of securities and never mentions offer in so many words."
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2015.902,2016.733,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.733,2023.179,"So, he clearly found fraud in the sale and you are inferring that maybe also offer, but it is not nearly as clear."
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2023.179,2024.351,"Well, that's quite correct."
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.273,2040.527,"And in all events, doesn't the question whether it is an offer or not simply become a question of law?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2040.527,2048.326,"That certainly is, and this Court could affirm or reinstate a correct District Court judgment on any applicable legal theory."
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.326,2069.732,"Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Walters just before he sat down called our attention to the finding under paragraph 11 by Judge Larson, saying that as to each count of the indictment, the court finds that the defendant acted as charged in the count willfully and knowingly."
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2071.715,2072.619,Willfully and knowingly?
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.619,2072.956,Yes.
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2072.956,2079.757,That is necessary to sustain a conviction under I believe it is Section 24 of the Act that requires scienter.
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.757,2080.395,Uhmm.
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2080.395,2085.791,And that was the reason for stating that he acted as charged in a willful manner and a knowing manner.
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.791,2093.467,"And as to each count of the indictment, was that charged, that it was done willfully and knowingly?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2093.467,2096.036,"I believe that it was, Your Honor."
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.036,2099.622,Including the offer as well as the sale?
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2099.622,2102.043,I think that that's correct.
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2102.043,2103.52,The indictment appears on page?
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2103.52,2107.697,Pages 14 through 15.
1978.78-561,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.018,2198.417,"Well, Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro, tell me again -- I think you covered it in your initial argument -- if you lose this case, how will the commission's operations be hurt or crippled?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2198.417,2205.656,There is a practical consequence to the choice between 17 (a) and Section 10 (b).
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.462,2232.207,"Well, is that quite clear, Mr. Shapiro?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2236.454,2236.832,Right.
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.832,2242.843,But is it perfectly clear that only if there is an injury to a purchaser or seller is the statute violated?
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2243.926,2245.239,I didn't mean to suggest that.
1978.78-561,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.514,2257.656,Would you satisfy that requirement here if you find this to be a sale?
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2257.656,2258.679,"Well, that's quite correct."
1978.78-561,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.679,2261.129,"But by contrast, this one refers also to an offer."
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2261.129,2265.081,"Offer and a sale, and that is the practical difference that Justice White was driving at."
1978.78-561,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.081,2275.127,"But if there is coverage here, what about private actions?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2275.127,2278.063,This Court has never decided whether there is a private action --
1978.78-561,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.063,2280.488,"Well, there wouldn't be if there wasn't coverage but --"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2280.488,2281.401,Correct.
1978.78-561,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.401,2289.109,"If you lost, there wouldn't be, but what if you win, how about private actions, would it necessarily follow or not?"
1978.78-561,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2289.109,2293.343,I don't think that it would necessarily follow that there would be a private action.
1978.78-561,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.048,2317.898,"Thank you, gentlemen."
