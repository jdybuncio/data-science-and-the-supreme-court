1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.058,We will hear arguments first this morning in National Labor Relations Board against International Longshoremen's Association.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,23.058,25.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,25.67,26.915,Mr. Wallace.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,26.915,73.488,"In this case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the Decisions and Orders of the National Labor Relations Board in two separate cases which are the most recent in a series of Board Decisions dealing with the validity under the Anti-boycotting Provisions of the National Labor Relations Act of various provisions and applications of the Rules on Containers which are in the East Coast labor contract between the Respondent Union and the shipping companies governs major ports on the East Coast."
1979.79-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.05,639.245,"As I read the Majority Opinion of the Court of Appeals, and I believe it was Judge Robb's Dissenting Opinion here, where he said that if a container is part of a whole -- a very large crate would have to be part of a whole, too -- I had the feeling that one would have to know the business pretty well to make a judgment on that."
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,652.255,657.356,"Well, I couldn't agree more with that suggestion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.464,713.907,Only because there's only one of each.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,713.907,719.283,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.451,906.792,"Mr. Wallace, you're telling us that the Court decided the right-to-control issue erroneously, or are you telling us that it was wrong to get into the issue at all?"
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,907.437,910.652,"Well, I am telling you it was erroneously decided."
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,936.839,941.378,"Therefore, the right to control issue is not really relevant?"
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,941.378,942.902,Well --
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.902,945.651,These were customer decisions.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,947.15,965.185,"Under Pipefitters, there wasn't a right to control, as we view the case; and therefore, this was an unlawful boycott even if the Court of Appeals disagreed with the Board's findings and factual inferences about the work traditions in the industry."
1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.388,1043.756,At what page is that?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1043.756,1073.693,"This is on page 51(a) of the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, in footnote 177 To avoid what the Court itself characterizes as the reduction ad absurdum of its Opinion, it relies on the violation of the Shipping Act to show the reasonableness of the Response that has been adopted here."
1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.08,1123.189,"Is there anything in the Opinion, Mr. Wallace, to suggest what would be the result if, in relation to that footnote, the ILA negotiated a contract for 100 miles on the next negotiator?"
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1123.725,1126.535,"Well, the Court didn't really address that --"
1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1126.535,1131.99,"Well, I get some hint that the Court was saying 50 miles and no more."
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1132.816,1145.824,"Well, perhaps that's the suggestion to avoid what the Court would say would be an absurd result, But the fact of the matter is, that is reliance on a discrimination that violates the Shipping Act."
1979.79-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.34,1170.699,Is there any litigation involving the Shipping Act?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1170.699,1179.155,There now is litigation to review the Maritime Commission's Decisions in these cases.
1979.79-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.107,1182.416,Rules violating the Shipping Act.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1182.416,1182.983,Yes.
1979.79-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.155,1190.324,And where they presently stand?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1190.324,1197.697,"They have not yet been decided by any Court, but Commission has made its determination, and there's no primary jurisdiction problem."
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.697,1205.403,Is there on-going antitrust litigation involving the ownership of the containers by the shipping companies?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1205.403,1217.737,"There's a pending petition in this Court, Mr. Justice, which the Court has not acted on from a Third Circuit case which is an antitrust claim."
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.737,1218.126,Private?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1219.132,1220.871,It's a private case.
1979.79-1082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.349,1227.221,Having to do with the ownership of the containers by the shipping companies.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1227.221,1227.878,Yes.
1979.79-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.677,1398.347,Woodworkers.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1404.202,1406.684,"Well, perhaps not in that case."
1979.79-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.79,1445.247,You say this argument was not made in the Court of Appeals.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1445.247,1447.202,It was not made in the Court of Appeals.
1979.79-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.202,1448.824,And would the Board rely on this at all?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1448.824,1451.347,The Board did not rely on it.
1979.79-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.347,1452.662,Doesn't that make a difference?
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1452.662,1468.925,"Well, the Board's interpretation on the National Labor Relations Act turns out to be consistent with the policy of this Act; and before a reviewing Court rejects that interpretation, it should take the policy of this Act into account, to the extent the reviewing Court --"
1979.79-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.925,1474.638,"Well, are you suggesting we ought to send it back to the Court of Appeals, and tell them to redo the case in light of that statute?"
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1474.638,1478.432,"Well, I'm not making that suggestion at all."
1979.79-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.432,1480.16,But you're suggesting that we do it.
1979.79-1082,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1480.16,1503.864,"Well, I'm suggesting that the Board's interpretation under the National Labor Relations Act even without this Act in the picture, should have been upheld by the Court of Appeals; and this is just another reason that corroborates the reviewing Court should not reject this interpretation when the rejection would result in contravention of this policy as well."
1979.79-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.405,1585.26,Mr. Lips.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1585.26,1586.632,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1979.79-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.12,1653.97,"But this technology has been an evolving one, has it not?"
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1653.97,1655.492,It most certainly has.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1905.068,1910.251,How was that traffic handled before containerization?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1910.251,1918.299,"It was usually consolidated; that is, the NVOCC's traffic was consolidated just like it is now."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.567,1926.828,"In other words, it would just go loose."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1926.828,1927.421,Yes.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1929.185,1933.427,"The consolidator would take less than truck load shipments and put them together as a truck load, wouldn't he?"
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1933.427,1935.732,The consolidator would coordinate.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.976,1944.449,How would he get them to the pier.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1944.449,1945.279,He would truck them.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.279,1945.508,By truck --
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1945.508,1946.76,And over-the-road carriers.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.76,1947.737,Loose in the truck.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1947.737,1948.687,Loose in the truck.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.687,1949.398,Yes.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1949.398,1951.422,Unless he used a different kind of container.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.88,1955.873,"And then when he got to the pier, what would happen?"
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1955.873,1964.043,"When he got to the pier, that cargo would be unloaded by the longshoremen and the trucker working together."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.415,1974.766,And now what happens is he consolidates it in the container.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1974.766,1974.929,That's correct.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1974.929,1976.468,He takes the container to the pier.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1977.886,1980.323,"At the pier, the container is taken off the truck chassis."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.323,1981.457,By whom?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,1981.457,1983.164,By the longshoremen.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.996,2003.508,"I take it, before containerization, that pier work by the longshoremen took hours."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2004.779,2005.493,Yes.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2006.333,2011.151,"And now, it's just a matter of lifting the filled container aboard the ship."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2011.678,2012.446,That's correct.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.446,2016.856,Which I gather can be done in a very small fraction of the time.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2016.856,2023.306,"The record indicates that with close coordination, sometimes the container can be delivered within an hour or two before the ship sails."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.306,2026.58,As against several hours -- or days -- of loading.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2026.58,2028.383,"And sometimes, a week or more."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.71,2051.712,Who loads it today?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2054.129,2057.087,"Well, the seaport terminal company with the crane."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.087,2057.581,I know.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2059.282,2060.317,"Well, I think the longshore workers."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.317,2061.476,The longshoremen do.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2061.476,2063.277,There is a truck chassis.
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.534,2076.647,"But sometimes, it's the actual trailer, isn't it?"
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2078.902,2081.085,The container sits on a wheel base.
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.085,2081.775,Yes.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2081.775,2085.687,"It very seldom sits on a flat bed, a regular flat bed of a car."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.687,2087.926,It then becomes the trailer.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2087.926,2088.972,It becomes the trailer.
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.047,2108.404,"In any event, the workers who load -- whether it's a train or a flatcar."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2112.286,2113.264,At that point.
1979.79-1082,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.158,2121.017,"Mr. Lips, we are here discussing purely facts, I take it."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2130.903,2135.288,"Well, they were clearly in the record before the Board and found by the Board."
1979.79-1082,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.254,2160.44,"So you say the Court of Appeals second guessed the Board, in effect."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2160.44,2160.915,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.524,2192.729,Let me ask just one factual question with your colloquy with Mr. Justice Brennan.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2214.227,2218.443,"They never consistently did that, your honor, until about 1975."
1979.79-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.671,2225.574,What are they doing at the time the facts developed in this case?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2226.201,2228.644,They did it differently in different places.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.091,2233.238,Isn't this what you were complaining about?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2233.238,2233.865,"Beg your pardon, sir?"
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2233.865,2235.57,I thought that's one of the things you were complaining about.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2235.57,2237.147,"Well, certainly, we are."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.529,2240.036,But now you're telling me they didn't do it.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2240.036,2241.037,No.
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.584,2306.027,"What I'd like to know is after the Dublin Supplement, and when you have a container that comes from less than 50 miles from the port, what happens to that container when it gets to the port?"
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2306.027,2316.013,"Under the Rules, the container generally was left alone; was not stripped and restuffed on the port."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.13,2341.164,"On occasion, you say."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2345.671,2361.434,"The Board in the associated case on the import side, the administrative law judge found that the union was only aware of or only took action against about 7 or 8 containers over a period of a two-year period."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.376,2392.3,"Now, the fines were levied, not against your client, but against the steamship companies."
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2393.43,2407.077,"The fines were levied against the steamship companies which then turned to our clients and said we don't have any contractual basis to make you reimburse us, but we're going to tell you, if you don't reimburse us, we won't give you any more containers."
1979.79-1082,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.077,2407.64,Right.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2407.64,2423.454,"Because the ILA's real dispute is with the trucker that's doing this work; and the only way it can get at the trucker and force this work back on the pier, is through the economic pressure against the sea-carrier."
1979.79-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.669,2475.665,At what point do you say the secondary activity begins in this sequence of events?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2475.665,2482.991,"Well, with respect to the Rules, it begins the day they're published and declared to be enforceable against all the trucking companies."
1979.79-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.991,2488.174,You don't get a secondary situation from something written on a piece of paper.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2493.094,2512.225,The activity that is the secondary boycott activity is where the sea-carrier says to the trucking company we will not give you any more containers unless you agree to our superimposed unilateral condition to not strip these containers within 50 miles.
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.225,2523.995,But it's your contention that the entering into the agreement by the shipping companies and the labor union was a violation of 8(e) is it not?
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2523.995,2525.133,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-1082,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.491,2526.713,In the absence of any activity.
1979.79-1082,1,31629,j_alan_lips,,2526.713,2544.613,We believe that the existence of the contract itself has a coercive effect on business.
1979.79-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.613,2546.708,Mr. Lambos.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2546.708,2548.613,Mr. Chief Justice.
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.961,2709.836,Mr. Lambos.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2715.159,2716.991,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2727.942,2733.677,"I, for example, don't know what longshoremen did before so I have to get it out of the record."
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2733.677,2738.969,I think that you will find that the Board specifically stated in various cases.
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.784,2795.902,You say you accept the findings of the Board.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2810.652,2811.338,"Yes, your honor"
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.338,2821.017,I take it they said that there were two different markets; and two different traditional ways of doing things.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2830.725,2833.836,They roughly said that.
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.836,2834.771,You don't accept that.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2834.771,2837.899,I don't accept that as a conclusion of law.
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2837.899,2841.212,That's a classical factual determination.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2841.212,2854.525,"I would disagree with that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I think that the facts upon which the Board acted, straight upon the record, indicated one basic error of law."
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.525,2863.612,But then you're accepting -- or not accepting -- the historical findings of fact of the Board?
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2863.612,2886.746,I am accepting the historical findings of fact of the Board which say that the longshoremen did the work initially; that the consolidator brought down the cargo piece by piece for the longshoremen to stuff it and strip it; and I quarrel with the Board's starting its examination into this matter by looking at what happened after the innovation and not --
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.746,2890.003,"That's a factual inquiry, too."
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2890.003,2891.57,"I disagree with that, your honor."
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.927,2921.467,"Well, what if the consolidators business had started a hundred years ago, and had been just accepted by the longshoremen?"
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2939.675,2942.441,"It would be the same, your honor, as the situation in National Woodworkers --"
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.441,2943.098,But what --
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2943.098,2946.05,Where they made doors in factories for years and years before that.
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.05,2949.451,But you would still say that this was a work preservation agreement.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2949.451,2950.636,I would say it's a work preservation --
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.636,2954.463,Even though it had been going on this way for a hundred years.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2954.463,2960.174,So long as the longshoremen were those who did the work prior to the innovation.
1979.79-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.174,2963.077,And as long as they had done it a hundred years ago.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,2963.077,2970.386,"The longshoremen did it, yes; hundreds and hundreds of years before that as well on a piece-by-piece basis."
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3041.453,3045.963,You say that this does not intrude on this new technology?
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3045.963,3086.817,"It does not intrude on this technology because what it has permitted to do is for unions and management to sit together and work out their problems without the union saying, as it may say here, if we have to go back to square one, we say may, and we on our side say yea; and there is no compromise possible because we don't know how some finder somewhere down the line may accept any compromise; and therefore, the only alternative appears to be industrial warfare."
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3093.093,3095.475,How about a 100-mile limit?
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3095.475,3095.997,Your honor --
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.997,3097.022,It would be a matter of agreement.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3099.181,3102.946,I think that the common law of the industry now is 50 miles.
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.34,3126.373,Where do you get the facts -- those surely are factual inquiries.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3126.373,3127.013,Pardon me?
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3127.013,3130.674,Those surely are factual inquiries.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3134.821,3136.714,That's also in the record.
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.956,3180.106,"But there has been a common thread, at least to my understanding running through both Pipefitters and Sandor and Woodworkers."
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3197.079,3205.507,"You will find, your honor, on a fair reading of the case before the Court of Appeals that they accepted the facts, and they said --"
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.507,3207.674,But your opponents don't agree with that.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3207.674,3208.213,Pardon me?
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.213,3210.009,Your opponents don't agree with that.
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3216.131,3222.28,"Well, they say that here, your honor; whereas, in the Court of Appeals, they said there are no issues of fact."
1979.79-1082,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.866,3272.145,"Well, where you say the Court defines the work."
1979.79-1082,2,19398,constantine_p_lambos,,3279.174,3280.062,"That's correct, your honor."
1979.79-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3308.446,3309.77,Mr. Gleason.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3309.77,3311.212,Mr. Chief Justice.
1979.79-1082,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3363.592,3364.773,Owned or leased?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3364.773,3365.758,Owned or leased.
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.312,3418.765,"Well, do I get from that that two containers which would be precisely the same dimensions, perhaps manufactured by the same manufacturer, one owned by one party, and the other owned by a different party, would be treated differently by the ILA."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3418.765,3422.148,"No, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.148,3427.873,You wanted a label on them so you could identify which ones had to be stripped.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3427.873,3440.166,"Those containers that were owned by the steamship company and also those containers that were moving to the consignee, whether it was outside the pier, a shippers load, or whether it was in another area."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3448.893,3460.188,And what function does -- what economic function does the stripping of this one container perform?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3460.188,3472.149,"Well, if you strip the container, and the problem we have is we had to protect; we're looking to protect the work of the longshoremen, i the longshoremen strip the container within the pier area, that meant work."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.22,3506.462,I go into my hypothetical.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3524.371,3525.013,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.013,3527.686,The other one -- what would you do with the other one?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3527.686,3535.382,"Your honor, if its a shippers load or its a container that's owned by the consolidator if it's his container, then it goes right on the ship."
1979.79-1082,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3705.824,3709.78,"Mr. Gleason, are those figures the figures of ILA work?"
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3712.608,3715.131,Those are the hours in the Port of New York alone.
1979.79-1082,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3715.131,3715.778,I see.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3720.686,3721.185,No.
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3752.762,3755.237,Is that in the record?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3755.237,3755.758,Yes.
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3760.13,3764.433,Was it found as a fact by the Board in this case?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3764.433,3771.554,"Your, honor, the problem was that we were not permitted to present any evidence before the Board in the Dolphin case."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3773.481,3775.819,Is this part of the Dolphin case?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3775.819,3779.28,It's referred to by Judge Wright.
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3779.28,3782.988,I'm not asking you whether it was referred to by Judge Wright.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3787.167,3794.537,"Well, your honor, again, this was not presented in the Dolphin case, but it was presented in the Conex case."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3794.537,3796.58,This isn't part of the Conex case.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3797.663,3800.33,"Well, the Board here takes everything that goes back to the Conex case."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3808.789,3809.676,In this case.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3811.547,3815.743,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3815.743,3822.804,"In the hypothetical question I've put to you, Mr. Gleason, I don't know whether you lost me or I lost you."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3836.513,3840.675,The purpose is to know who owns the containers and whether they fell within the Rules.
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3840.675,3845.9,And what do you do as a result of seeing a particular label on one?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3849.806,3859.018,"If a container came in and it was a consolidator's container, then they would look to see whether or not the work was done within the 50-mile radius."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3859.018,3861.479,And then if it is within the 50-mile radius.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3861.479,3870.197,"If it was done within the 50-mile radius, we would tell the company that this was a violation; we'd have to strip the container."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3870.197,3871.544,Tell us precisely.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3871.544,3875.24,"Then they would strip the container, and load it in another container."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3886.319,3887.429,Let me back up.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3898.403,3899.527,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3899.527,3901.738,A one-car garage.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3919.733,3921.775,"Your honor, they all have to be the same containers."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3925.681,3931.057,"And then having moved it from the one container into the other, you pick it up with a hoist and put in the hold."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,3931.057,3931.959,"That's right, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4005.117,4008.824,Are these containers now being used on cargo airlines?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4008.824,4009.896,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4013.243,4014.542,The container system.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4026.065,4027.033,"No, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4055.14,4066.316,What if the parties saw to it that the container which is used on the airplane was also used in the hold of the ship --
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4066.316,4067.407,Put on an airplane?
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4072.152,4074.904,And the airport would be within 50 miles.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4074.904,4075.322,Sure.
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4156.911,4161.064,Are you satisfied with the result in the Conex case?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4161.064,4161.68,"No, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4161.68,4162.078,No.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4166.796,4167.238,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4190.156,4196.381,Chairman Fanning -- didn't he join to concur with the Board in the Conex case?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4196.381,4197.156,"No, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4198.707,4199.968,He did.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4200.297,4201.058,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4201.058,4202.935,But he dissented in this case.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4202.935,4204.392,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4204.392,4207.215,He seemed to think there was a difference between the two cases.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4207.215,4214.766,"Well, I think the difference was that he probably came about to understand what the rules were about; and the fact that --"
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4214.766,4215.883,And he came to change his mind.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4215.883,4216.529,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4255.371,4260.237,"Well, Mr. Gleason, you say their collective bargaining agreement."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4267.742,4268.138,That's --
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4268.138,4277.296,It isn't as if it were simply a contract between two private commercial people that could go out and make whatever contract they wanted.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4277.296,4287.925,"I think we solved that problem, your honor, in saying hey, the work that has to be done on the containers that are owned or leased by the steamship carriers -- we're going to do that work."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4365.259,4373.856,"Well, Mr. Gleason, when they invented the automobile, they put a lot of horse collar manufacturers out of business."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4376.59,4376.716,No.
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4445.138,4455.031,Why wouldn't -- and maybe you just gave up some of this -- but why wouldn't the reasoning that you use apply equally beyond the 50-mile line?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4462.046,4463.796,Yes.
1979.79-1082,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4543.388,4572.583,"Well, what do you say about the argument that the -- say, like in the New York area, where -- and it's certainly argued in this case that the forwarders perform special services besides the stuffing; that in terms of efficiency, expedition, safety, et cetera; that that is a special business; stuff, but they do more than that."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4572.583,4573.617,Your honor.
1979.79-1082,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4588.7,4591.221,"So you say that whatever it is, it isn't much."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4591.221,4591.778,No.
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4594.585,4605.22,But why would a shipper ever go to a consolidator or a forwarder rather than taking it down to the pier unless there was some real -- He was paying for it.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4608.784,4609.135,Your honor.
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4644.275,4647.645,But that's not work done traditionally by longshoremen.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4647.645,4648.018,Sure.
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4654.574,4660.368,"But, I mean, consolidation done, say, 50 or 100 miles away from the port."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4660.368,4667.249,"Your honor, I may say this that I don't know of any consolidation that was ever done 100 miles away from the port prior to containerization."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4667.249,4675.335,"Well, isn't a primary function of consolidators to take care of less than car load shipments or less than truck load shipments?"
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4675.335,4680.318,"Consolidation really years ago, I think, was in the railroad industry."
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4766.382,4768.475,"Well, it isn't exactly automation."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4783.824,4785.763,"Well, I think it's -- whose containers?"
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4785.763,4786.611,"Well, yes --"
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4786.611,4788.651,Whose ever they are --
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4788.651,4792.775,"Nevertheless, what the longshoremen want is the stripping done on the pier."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4792.775,4794.161,Only those containers --
1979.79-1082,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4794.161,4795.496,I understand.
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4800.178,4812.057,And we really don't even want -- taking that container and having it done by a consolidator because we find that there is so much - so many practices.
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4837.66,4839.848,Was that to evade the 50-mile rule?
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4839.848,4842.222,"Yes, your honor."
1979.79-1082,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4845.99,4849.356,"Mr. Gleason, I still have a little problem with the economics of the situation."
1979.79-1082,3,42762,thomas_w_gleason,,4856.896,4864.521,"I don't think so because they have a minimum rate for, I guess, cargo and out."
1979.79-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5011.768,5015.628,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Wallace?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5015.628,5019.175,"Just two or three points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-1082,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5091.321,5099.059,"Whatever the actual day-to-day practices are, however various they may be, there is the Agreement, isn't there?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5099.059,5100.167,There is the Agreement.
1979.79-1082,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5100.167,5103.176,And isn't it claimed to be --
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5103.176,5105.741,The Board found it to be an 8(e) violation.
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5151.371,5170.383,"Mr. Wallace, how do you view the Court of Appeals differing with the Board on what work was traditionally within the longshoremen's jurisdiction and what was traditionally within the forwarders or consolidators business?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5174.748,5177.012,It's a mixed question of fact and law.
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5181.504,5185.867,"Do you think, then, it should be reviewed on a substantial evidence basis by the Board?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5187.698,5189.007,I do.
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5189.007,5191.417,What error did they make?
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5191.417,5193.957,The Court of Appeals?
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5193.957,5197.479,On this particular question?
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5197.479,5202.099,"Well, in concluding that the Board didn't have --"
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5202.099,5204.898,"But they applied the right test, didn't they?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5204.898,5206.884,The Court of Appeals?
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5207.864,5217.198,"They say they applied -- they came out with the wrong result, but they didn't purport to you some other test, the wrong test in reviewing the Board, did they?"
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5217.198,5226.047,"They purported to use the traditional test and to comply with this Court's Decisions, as did the Courts that reached the opposite result in the other cases."
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5226.047,5232.426,Haven't we said that really the Courts of Appeals ought to be the final word on evidentiary things?
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5236.223,5240.382,That was the position that we took in opposing certiorari in the Conex case.
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5251.916,5255.197,I suppose --
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5255.197,5262.573,There's a need for resolution because of the pressing labor situation in those ports.
1979.79-1082,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5290.176,5292.869,So you do say they applied the wrong standard in reviewing --
1979.79-1082,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5292.869,5294.822,"Well in that sense, I do."
1979.79-1082,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5340.366,5345.208,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
