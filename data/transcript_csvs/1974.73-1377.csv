1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.091,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1377, Train against New York and Train against Campaign Clean Water."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,45.047,47.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.833,217.227,Did you say drama or grammar?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,217.227,220.502,I may eliminate both Mr. Justice Stewart but I meant to say drama.
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.502,221.504,D-R-A-M-A.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,221.504,223.634,Correct.
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.016,261.57,"That the case in other words, everybody seems to agree as they involve the matter of statutory construction."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,261.57,262.57,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.57,264.834,Rather than any kind of constitutional question.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,264.834,265.317,That is correct.
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.317,266.521,Implicit or explicit?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,266.521,266.946,That is correct.
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.665,669.955,In vetoing the bill originally that the –- was there a veto message?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,669.955,675.576,"There was a veto message which related to the objection to the level of spending, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.576,678.769,Anything in the veto message bearing on the issues here?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,678.769,689.263,"I think not, he does refer to the fact that he' worried about federal spending, but I think that was not -- the President seems worried about federal spending and the effect on inflation and taxes and so forth."
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.29,701.567,"No, I'm was going to ask that his discretion at this and with regards to that."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,701.567,716.587,"I do not recall it this -- as to a discretion yes, he thought that he didn't have enough in the veto message and indeed in overwriting the veto, Congress, a number of Congressmen explicitly said that it's too bad he thought that because he's plainly does have discretion."
1974.73-1377,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,759.942,769.467,"I suppose General Bork that so long as there is discretion at some stage, the ability of the states to plan will be affected."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,769.467,770.266,That is correct.
1974.73-1377,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,770.266,779.77,"Whether it's at one or the other, so that an argument based entirely on ability to plan runs into that obstacle."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,779.77,792.682,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it seems to me that there are a variety of arguments in these briefs, which are quite persuasive until you realize that they are all arguments that Congress should have written a different statute."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.419,813.181,But if something isn't allotted here about the plan.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,813.181,815.096,"That is correct, they are not about to commit themselves which is this."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.096,820.2,"Yes and whether they are about to plan anything, except beyond whatever is allotted to."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,820.2,821.877,That is correct on the other hand Mr. --
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.877,828.106,"If they have allotted something they may plan knowing perfectly will, they are going to have to submit the plans that will get by."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,828.106,833.693,"Well, I think they are now able to begin to plan in that sense."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.693,835.858,But not beyond their allotment.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,835.858,865.273,"To plan, yes Mr. Justice White, maybe were using the words in a different sense, but the administration construes -- construes the statute to require that all of the sums be expended and there is now under discussion of variety of ways of timing for the release of these funds they may state that no final decision has been made, so that planning for what -– where will we use this funds and in what way when they become available could go on now."
1974.73-1377,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,872.754,878.356,What happens if the Congress ultimately refuses to appropriate?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,878.356,888.165,"Well, I would hesitate to give a firm answer to that Mr. Justice Blackmun because we might have a suit in the Court of Claims which we might have to defend."
1974.73-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.152,926.354,"Yet it's not an uncommon phenomenon, is it, for Congress to authorize a substantially more money for a given project than it ultimately appropriate?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,926.354,947.955,"Well it may be, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I think here, it may authorize it but if states have gone forward, and expanded their own funds and got themselves into commitments, which are legally binding, I think it could be extraordinary if Congress bend back down on its promise."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.802,966.018,"But you said a moment ago that this was a unique or well, a unique way of going about appropriating or making funds available, different from the ordinary budget or budgetary process."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,966.018,967.82,"As I understand it, yes."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.82,970.258,What is that difference do you think?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,970.258,973.908,In part of this process of authorizing for appropriation.
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.908,982.421,Well isn't that pretty usual of authorizing this as Mr. Justice Rehnquist says more than they may have eventually appropriate?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,982.421,990.791,"I don't think it's usual to have a process in which you authorize for appropriation and then go to the allotment stage and the obligation stage and then appropriate, I may be quite if that's --"
1974.73-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.791,997.605,"But the allotment stage is unique here in the budgetary process, isn't it relevant in the authorization or the appropriation?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,997.605,1008.386,Well I had this -- the authorization for appropriation and its purpose explained to me and I was told that it is quite unique in this kind of a statute.
1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.298,1032.588,That what it makes unique?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1032.588,1033.819,I think that is Mr. Justice.
1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1033.819,1046.545,So does this takes it outside of what has been our common rubric in the Appropriations Committee that the Congress proposes but we the Appropriations Committee dispose.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1046.545,1065.856,"I think this does tend, I don't think this is that I may say so, central to the issue we have before us, but I think this does to some degree limit appropriation of committee's influence on the size of the appropriations."
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1083.335,1101.632,"So, Mr. Solicitor General initially I think did not the government take position that this commitment of $18 billion perhaps that's not the word, right word here, this $18 billion did not necessarily have to be spent, but now I gather that the position of the Government and that must be spent under this legislation."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1101.632,1101.82,That is the--
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1101.82,1105.972,But the discretion is such that it may be spent over a period of time.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1105.972,1112.697,"It may be -- the amount we now believe is firm, it may be stretched out in the expenditure."
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1112.697,1119.163,"Well, to that extent, when you say it must be spent to that extent, and that's to say it's been appropriated, isn't it?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1119.163,1131.801,"Oh no, no I mean we think the executive under the statute has an obligation to allot the $18 billion ultimately."
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1134.868,1144.036,"Yes, that's I understand you say that but to the extent that the $18 billion must be spent, Congress has indicated that it's going to be there."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1144.036,1147.126,That as Congress has certainly indicated that.
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1147.126,1155.676,But yet you think something else may be necessarily the nature of congressional appropriations in fact to make the $18 billion?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1155.676,1156.39,I think so.
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.156,1178.829,But whatever this view now say that whatever discretion executive got and doesn't go –- that doesn't extend to deciding that the X million or billion dollars will not be spent at any --
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1178.829,1182.5,"That is correct Mr. Justice White, the discretion is timing."
1974.73-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.5,1191.082,But the fact that the executive doesn't have that discretion doesn't necessarily mean that Congress will ultimately appropriate all the money that is now authorized.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1191.082,1208.115,"That is quite true Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I said to that only one that I will find to be extraordinary if Congress got states into this position and then let them down, and I would think that there might well be litigation in the Court of Claims over litigation is to which I think I have not, not -- not now to take a position."
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1208.115,1216.258,"But ordinarily I, a different –- the mere fact and authorization doesn't give any assurance to anyone that necessarily would be in the appropriation."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1216.258,1216.671,That is correct.
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1216.671,1227.259,"Here there's something more may not be a complete assurance of appropriation but I gather you're saying that they can't let the states down, almost they'll have to."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1227.259,1227.809,I beg your pardon.
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.809,1230.934,Well the congress certainly will have to.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1232.81,1235.906,They have certainly indicated that and I think that is a moral commitment at the very least.
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1235.906,1238.564,"In that extent, this is a little different than the ordinary --"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1238.564,1238.927,Yes.
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1238.927,1239.705,"-- case, is it?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1239.705,1241.079,"I believe so, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.079,1253.759,"Well, the mechanism would be that if the House Appropriations Committee declined to appropriate and the Senate Appropriations Committee also, you are suggesting the House and the Senate could override."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1253.759,1254.279,Oh yes.
1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.279,1257.049,And reject that would take care of it.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1257.049,1257.647,I think so.
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.279,1351.989,Is the veto message somewhere in the --
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1351.989,1374.586,"It's in the -- in the joint appendix Mr. Justice Stewart in brown book and it's -- well, I trust that it's in the record and I'm sure it's, I will."
1974.73-1377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.586,1375.855,Maybe (Voice Overlap).
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1375.855,1378.328,We can check while we're doing it.
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.306,1524.735,"Well, this is the -- they (Inaudible) themselves and I thought that just disagreed on as to when."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1524.735,1529.034,At the stage of the process at which discretion occurs.
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.034,1532.433,"Your points don't say the discretion of the excised, is it?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1532.433,1544.866,"Well, they want to cut it down to -– it's very odd Mr. Justice White, to see for example the scope of judicial review of the discretion that is suggested right in the Campaign Clean Water brief."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.158,1594.845,"Did you say yes that as you presently view the Act in terms of whether the $18 billion custody allotted at sometime, do you say that the (Inaudible) must be continued at the City of New York?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1594.845,1604.917,"No, I think the City of New York thinks that except for program-related reasons, not federal fiscal policy reasons that the money must be obligated."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.36,1615.174,"Well, there is a -- there is a major difference with the major gulf between you and the Government."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1615.174,1622.905,"The major gulf between the Government and both of these respondents is the scope of the discretion, and I think that's the nob of the case."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.905,1623.98,Not the time?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1623.98,1624.883,Not the time.
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.883,1625.844,The scope?
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1625.844,1649.121,"The scope, I think the statute is clear on the time, but as a practical matter, the scope is what counts and I think the scope is quite clear from the way these amendments were used to overwrite the presidential veto on the fiscal considerations and it was explicitly said that these amendments give him control if he thinks the spending is too high."
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1653.062,1681.492,"Mr. Solicitor General, on page 9 of your brief, as I understand it, that down to bottom of page 9, you say in effect that there is no practical difference between exercising control over the rate of spending at the two stages if I understand that and if that is correct, what is the difference between the parties here today?"
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1681.492,1700.92,"Well I think the –- as I mentioned, Mr. Justice Powell, we felt that the statute clearly places at the allotment stage and if we didn't come up to this Court with that, that we could get -- whipsawed it by a later Court saying, you've already allotted, now your discretion is gone."
1974.73-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1700.92,1714.581,"So, in effect you are protecting a future position, the ultimate affect that a judge, in your opinion, unless you heard flunk in this way, it will be the same."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1714.581,1736.728,"If this -– if I understand the issue, Mr. Justice Powell, if this Court for example, were to write an opinion, saying that the discretion operates contrary to our submission at the obligation stage rather than the allotment stage, it would make almost no difference."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.954,1781.078,If the only issue that we thought that was presented with Justice Frankfurter's question.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1781.078,1781.444,It is not the --
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.444,1782.337,That discretion.
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1782.337,1791.901,"It is not the only issue, Mr. Justice White, in Campaign Clean Water, the Fourth Circuit repealed and reversed and remanded for a trial de novo of the President's exercise of its discretion."
1974.73-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.901,1796.157,"But if the only issue were to finding, there wouldn't be much to argue about."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1798.273,1809.159,"Well, I wouldn't care much if this Court told me which stage is was at, Mr. Justice White, but if the lower court did, then I would be in the position of perhaps getting caught by a Court in a different jurisdiction disagreeing."
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1809.159,1816.446,"But the important thing here is, whether we say allotment or obligation, your real concern is the breadth of discretion of the President."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1816.446,1832.04,"That is -- that I think is the real nob of this case, and I think that the statute itself on its phase is an unconfined discretion and the variety of congressional expressions."
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1832.04,1837.873,"I see that your light is running out Mr. Bork, are you going to say anything about this, I haven't had a chance to read it only roughly this morning."
1974.73-1377,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1837.873,1846.11,"I will say only about that, Mr. Justice Brennan, that that brief proves in our opinion mathematically that the new Act does not affect this case."
1974.73-1377,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1846.11,1856.818,I see.
1974.73-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.818,1874.843,"Counsel, in view of the way the timing is working out here today, we'll extend for your side of the table six minutes and give the Solicitor General six minutes more that will consist of approximately right at 3 o'clock, so you can --"
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,1874.843,1875.435,Thank you very much.
1974.73-1377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.435,1877.495,"(Voice Overlap) accordingly, Mr. Thompson."
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,1877.495,1883.183,"Well, these are two -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2121.591,2126.094,Mr. Thompson you're going to suggest what the practical difference is that the time it takes --
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2126.094,2141.638,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan and that was raised by questions from Your Honor and from Justices Black and Blackmun -- White and Blackmun."
1974.73-1377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2243.534,2253.06,"In other words, knowing advance that you're going to have $350 million, I'll put you in the position where you can plan around a possibility of (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2253.06,2317.083,"Not only a position, Your Honor, where you can plan but you may even not be able to plan as a local official unless you have some kind of ticket from the Government, some kind of go ahead, something you can point to, to the rest of your bureaucracy, to your city council, your older men, what ever happens to be and to your constituents, who were also affected by this to the people, that same statement on page 23 of the brief, in that same statement, Mr. Harsha mentions a kind of things that are included in the planning process and there are a lot more than just simply drawing up engineering and architectural plans and specifications, long as that takes and difficult is that is, he mentions planning generally, by which I take that he meant community planning deciding where these -- where these various plants and collection systems, I might add, where they will be located?"
1974.73-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.228,2567.635,"Mr. Thompson, do you think that the administrator under your theory, his discretion is confined at the obligation stage, do you think he has the same order of discretion or degree of discretion at that stage that the Solicitor General contends he has at the allocation stage?"
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2567.635,2577.235,I have never heard this until today seen any indication from the Government is to exactly how broad they thought the discretion was.
1974.73-1377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.633,2727.53,"Mr. Thompson, do you -- do you think there's any difference between you and the Solicitor General other than the timing of the discretion?"
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2733.457,2748.258,"Mr. Justice White, we have not been discussing -- we have not been thinking ourselves except the academic way and we have not been arguing with the Government in our case over the scope of the obligation -– of the scope of the discretion."
1974.73-1377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.132,2757.291,"Do you seem to concede, there are some discretion sometimes."
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2757.291,2769.423,"Now that -- and now they also, they have changed their positions since the early days of those litigation to say that full amount of the $18 billion must be allotted sometime."
1974.73-1377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.439,2804.904,"I'm not sure if it's unfair question but do you concede that at the commitment stage, the obligation stage, there is discretion to refuse, to obligate because the executive does not want to spend money that fast?"
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2804.904,2816.287,"I don't believe that's an unfair question but as I replied to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would be -- there would be gratuitous answer that I would give you."
1974.73-1377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.432,2829.583,But does that not concede discretion?
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2829.583,2837.815,"It certainly we -- excuse me, we would concede that there was a measure of discretion."
1974.73-1377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2852.55,2859.832,But you take a more extreme example if suddenly we got him to some peripheral war that might have a lot to do with it.
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2859.832,2871.839,I think under the statute that certainly would authorize it and then as indicated under the Budget Act anyway it would be subject if we were getting way off base too in effect to correction by Congress.
1974.73-1377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2871.839,2872.676,By resolution?
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2872.676,2874.969,"By resolution, yes sir."
1974.73-1377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.969,2889.983,"Mr. Thompson, perhaps you address yourself to this but if so I missed it, do you agree with the basic trust of this most recent brief filed by the Solicitor General as to the non-applicability of the new legislation too?"
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2889.983,2892.474,We haven't been favored with the copy of that Your Honor but --
1974.73-1377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.474,2894.197,We all referred to it last time.
1974.73-1377,1,33315,john_r_thompson,,2894.197,2914.069,"But -- from what -- from what the Solicitor General said, we would agree with it with one caveat that this proposed deferral of allotments has been included in the special message that the President sent to Congress."
1974.73-1377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2983.258,2994.591,"Thank you Mr. Thompson, Mr. Jacks, you will have about 18-and-a-half minutes now."
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,2994.591,2997.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1377,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.88,3077.901,You think the discretion is only at the allotment stage?
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3077.901,3079.844,"Yes sir, we do."
1974.73-1377,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.345,3082.394,Yet it is an either or problem.
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3082.394,3082.713,No.
1974.73-1377,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3082.713,3084.044,Proposes on there.
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3084.044,3098.064,"Well, we think our reading of the statute and legislative history, we think it's pretty clear that the discretion was intended to be exercised at the allotment stage because it was the section of allotments and not the section on obligations that was amended."
1974.73-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.588,3120.999,"So, you wouldn't think that the -– what the executive allots, he cannot later at the obligation stage say, “We're spending money too fast”?"
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3120.999,3124.611,"I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3348.262,3366.186,Doesn't the Solicitor General's representation of the Government's policy or position with respect to the commitment of the entire $18 billion at least to cut some of the foundation away from that argument?
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3366.186,3378.771,"It doesn't give me much satisfaction, Mr. Chief Justice, because under the statute, there was a timeframe intended as well as an intent as to the job to be done."
1974.73-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3419.381,3427.938,Doesn't the power of Congress to deal with this by resolution at any time give any conflict to you?
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3427.938,3444.697,"No sir, it does not because I agree with the Solicitor General that the new Budget Control Act which became effective on July 12, 1974, doesn't apply, at least not right now, to the impoundment actions which are at issue in this case."
1974.73-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3471.108,3474.086,I have some difficulty with that Mr. Jacks.
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3484.304,3484.875,Clearly --
1974.73-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3484.875,3486.703,"-- the day after tomorrow, couldn't they?"
1974.73-1377,2,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,3486.703,3489.293,"Clearly, when we're dealing with the Congress."
1974.73-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3737.161,3738.069,Thank you Mr. Jacks.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3742.502,3744.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1377,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3808.825,3813.659,"Your point is that it's unreviewable, judicially unreviewable discretion."
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3813.659,3826.552,"If -- Mr. Justice Stewart, if Congress said that the President, “Spend this money unless you think inflation is getting out of hand or other priorities are more important, but we'd like you to spend this money unless you find something like that.”"
1974.73-1377,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3840.36,3841.601,"So, your answer is yes?"
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3841.601,3842.106,Yes.
1974.73-1377,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3842.106,3843.348,Judicially unreviewable.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3843.348,3844.558,At that stage.
1974.73-1377,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3930.211,3931.483,Can you say that again?
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3931.483,3944.194,As I am -- I am informed that the administrator of OMB has reported to Congress that the total needs for water purification in this country are going to amount to all over $300 billion.
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3988.258,4004.607,"Is there anything in the legislative history up to this time, Mr. Solicitor General that suggests that this astronomical figure that you now mentioned was in contemplation when they got there, putting the door with $18 billion?"
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4004.607,4009.144,"No, I think Mr. Chief Justice, that the problem was vastly under estimated."
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4009.144,4012.724,"Nobody -- nobody really knows, is that it?"
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4012.724,4014.775,Nobody knew it that time.
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4034.305,4055.584,"I gather, Mr. Solicitor, that if we would agree with you, you would still feel whether the choice was at the allotment stage or at the allegation stage, or to be reversals in both of these cases where the remands for dismissal for both complaints?"
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4055.584,4057.367,"That is precisely what I think should happen, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4057.367,4063.967,The latter on the ground that this is a non-reviewable discretion and therefore a political question in that sense?
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4063.967,4072.542,It could be put either in the form of non-reviewable or in the form of Congress intended it to be this broad and therefore there is no function.
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4072.542,4073.148,Yes.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4073.148,4074.107,-- to be served.
1974.73-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4076.974,4084.224,"It could be very, very broad and still be reviewable or it could be relatively narrow as you point out and still -- and still be non-reviewable."
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4084.224,4085.317,That is quite true.
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4111.45,4120.229,"Well, an executive, especially presumably specially informed in the field."
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4120.229,4124.763,"That's -- that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, an executive with delegated authority in this case."
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4124.763,4127.103,And with standards?
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4127.103,4136.818,"The only standards that are apparent in the legislative history, they are non-apparent on the face of the statute, it's an unbounded discretion."
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4143.316,4157.041,"Well, that would not preclude an administrator from sua sponte promulgating regulations or invading rule making as you intimated, would it?"
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4157.041,4160.794,"No, that would not prevent the administrator from inviting rule making --"
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4160.794,4165.725,Under $300 to $350 billion that might well be indicated.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4165.725,4167.651,"I was suggesting as much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4181.984,4183.024,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4183.024,4185.424,May I just (Inaudible).
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4190.917,4192.078,At the allotment stage.
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4192.078,4193.71,At the allotment stage.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4198.458,4203.04,"One judgment below does, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia says, “Know the obligation stage.”"
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4203.04,4203.486,Yes.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4203.486,4210.104,"The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit says, “The court below found the allotment stage was correct, nobody contest that, so we assume it's correct."
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4210.104,4210.456,Yes.
1974.73-1377,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4220.264,4223.53,Affirm the Fourth Circuit.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4223.53,4234.753,"You have to affirm in the respect that the discretion is at the allotment stage, I would ask you to reverse the remand for trial de novo on the discretion issue."
1974.73-1377,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4234.753,4236.13,And send it back to dismissal.
1974.73-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4236.247,4247.15,"You didn't think the deal is to when, when you said that was only at the -- at the obligation stage then we wouldn't be reversing the New York case."
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4247.15,4248.372,"No, you would not Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4248.372,4249.935,We'll affirm it.
1974.73-1377,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,4249.935,4262.839,But the -- the -- I suppose the Fourth Circuit case would drop out then there will be no litigation when the discretion was exercised at the obligation stage.
1974.73-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4262.839,4273.711,"Mr. Thompson, Mr. Jacks, it appears that you have not until recently and perhaps only today will have received the supplemental brief."
1974.73-1377,4,45143,w_thomas_jacks,,4287.704,4289.806,"We certainly shall, Your Honor."
1974.73-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4289.806,4290.434,Thank you.
