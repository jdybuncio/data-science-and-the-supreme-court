1962.53,0,40528,robert_w_stanley,,70.378,73.88,There is a question of the initial arrest.
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3518.251,3518.715,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1962.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3518.715,3520.842,You may now proceed.
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3520.842,3528.324,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Honorable Court.
1962.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3655.965,3661.73,Was the search of the bedroom on a different occasion than the -- than finding the brick?
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3661.73,3665.159,"It almost immediately followed, if Your Honor please."
1962.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3665.159,3670.294,And they did litigate the question of the brick.
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3670.294,3672.411,"Yes, at the probable cause hearing."
1962.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3674.157,3686.138,"Well, every time they opened a drawer or go into another room after the first search has been litigated, must they object to every question along those lines?"
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3686.138,3689.885,"Oh, I see Your Honor's point."

1962.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3768.518,3771.225,"What page of the record did you refer to, (Inaudible)"
1962.53,1,26010,gordon_ringer,,3771.225,3773.42,"68 -- pardon me, Your Honor, 68."
