1983.82-629,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.073,"Mr. Cross, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,54.073,60.196,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.795,296.912,"Mr. Cross, I take it since you are appealing from the judgment of the highest court of the State of North Dakota it is your position that there is some federal constitutional principle or federal statute which that decision has violated."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,296.912,298.38,"That is right, Your Honor."
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.077,316.918,"Well, do you think the Supreme Court of North Dakota actually read Public Law 280 to reach that result?"
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,333.569,352.279,"Your Honor Justice Rehnquist, the decision itself indicates plainly that the state court regarded judicial jurisdiction of the state as extending to these actions before the enactment of the state statute involved under the authority of Public Law 280."
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.482,394.669,But up to then it is all questions of state law is it not?
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,394.669,397.167,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,397.167,414.051,"This case is a curious one, is it not, because here the tribe is asserting jurisdiction in the state court and usually these cases come up here in just the reverse posture."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,414.051,414.91,"That is correct, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,453.082,454.473,Was your due process argument argued below?
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,454.473,456.769,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1983.82-629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.769,476.932,"Mr. Cross, I suppose that it would not be necessary to reach that if in fact we thought that Public Law 280 was the grounds on which the North Dakota court based its holding and we could I suppose give North Dakota another look at it."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,476.932,478.666,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.895,494.285,Let me ask you another question.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,509.873,520.398,"Since the Plaintiff here is a tribe, the tribe according to decisions by this Court has sovereign immunity."
1983.82-629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.583,533.862,"Well, do you think there would be waiver as a matter of law if the tribe decides to sue in the state court?"
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,533.862,543.249,"--Well, as a matter of law, Justice O'Connor, Wold Engineering can recover to the extent of a set off."
1983.82-629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.365,573.377,"Nevertheless, to allow the set off you have to adjudicate their claim."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,573.377,574.518,That is correct.
1983.82-629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.518,579.25,You do concede that that much could be done.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,583.718,585.638,"That is correct, Your Honor, to that limited extent."
1983.82-629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.638,597.758,Is there any jurisdictional problem of a state court asserting jurisdiction against an Indian tribe over a claim arising on the reservation?
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,597.758,606.661,"Your Honor, based on the state court decision below they did not differentiate between claims by tribal members or claims by tribes."
1983.82-629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,690.19,698.249,"Mr. Cross, am I correct under the decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court your people have no forum whatsoever?"
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,698.249,699.872,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.793,864.322,"Those were cases, were they not, where the state court had affirmatively said we have jurisdiction."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,887.39,890.561,"--That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,960.767,971.668,What you want is to have the North Dakota Supreme Court take another look at the situation disabused of any misapprehension about 280.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,971.668,973.715,"That is correct, Justice."
1983.82-629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.21,1086.919,"Mr. Cross, may I ask a question because when one reads the North Dakota Supreme Court's opinion one might get the impression... At least I got it the first time I read it... that they were just construing their own law and they did not feel compelled to construe it the way they did by Public Law 280."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1098.539,1126.84,As I read the appellate record in the North Dakota Supreme Court the position taken by Respondent was that Public Law 280 authorized the state to enact Chapter 2719 and disclaim jurisdiction that it previously claimed or in the alternative that Public Law 280 was the nature of a preemptive statute which by a negative reading precluded--
1983.82-629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.84,1132.838,"That reading would be consistent with yours, but the former reading would just merely authorize if they decided to authorize them to do it."
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1138.71,1142.818,--That would raise a different issue.
1983.82-629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.294,1164.012,That was all before 1963.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1164.012,1166.011,That was before 1963.
1983.82-629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.011,1174.992,Then they say that because of the 1963 enactment of 2719 which is a North Dakota statute everything has changed.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1174.992,1199.42,Our expectation is that when this issue is clarified by the Supreme Court on the construction of the Public Law 280 or the federal law issue that the prior declarations that was a matter of state constitutional law and federal constitutional rights that the Indians do have access to state courts for actions arising on reservations is the proper policy they would follow.
1983.82-629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.97,1240.014,I am just wondering if one possible thing we should consider is perhaps sending the case back to that court and asking them the basis of their decision because if it is one basis then it presents a federal constitutional question.
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1247.276,1248.198,"That is correct, Justice."
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.718,1291.15,"Well, Mr. Cross, how about the statement at page 7A of the petition which is part of the opinion of the Supreme Court of North Dakota where they say that In re White Shield they are quoting from and they say"
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1324.01,1343.502,"Justice Rehnquist, that action was taken under Section 7 of Public Law 280 and the action that was taken by the state legislature and embodied in the state statute was construed by the Supreme Court as being affirmatively authorized legislation under Section 7 of Public Law 280."
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.589,1368.883,Do you think anything we would say about Public Law 280 would make the Supreme Court of North Dakota feel differently about what the legislature meant by enacting a statute?
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1368.883,1383.079,I think that if the legislature and the construction of the statute by the State Supreme Court conflicts with Public Law 280 that they would take what this Court has to say very seriously indeed.
1983.82-629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.079,1389.061,"You are saying it would take a new act of the legislature, not just a new decision of the Supreme Court of North Dakota?"
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1389.061,1405.681,"No, I am saying, Justice Rehnquist, that the statute as construed by this Court since it is under the authority of a federal law and a function of the delegated power would take on a new aspect to that court."
1983.82-629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1408.836,1420.753,You are also relying on decisions of the North Dakota court subsequent to White Shield or whatever it is as far as 280 is concerned?
1983.82-629,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1420.753,1421.673,That is correct.
1983.82-629,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1444.509,1452.349,Mr. Claiborne.
1983.82-629,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1452.349,1455.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.05,1667.667,"Mr. Claiborne, would not our normal practice be if we agreed with you that the Supreme Court of North Dakota was wrong in saying that Section 280 had affirmatively authorized this to go on and decide for ourselves whether we thought there was a constitutional violation resulting from the Supreme Court of North Dakota?"
1983.82-629,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1672.884,1702.388,"Justice Rehnquist, we do not oppose the suggestion that if the federal constitutional question is as plain as we think it is that it would be appropriate for this Court to go ahead and decide it and accordingly to reverse the judgment without need for any further proceedings except for trial of the contract claim in the District Court of North Dakota."
1983.82-629,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.984,1782.262,How about Section 1981?
1983.82-629,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1787.603,1792.336,It does seem to us that Section 1981 may well be applicable.
1983.82-629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.217,2100.509,Mr. McCutcheon.
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2100.509,2103.242,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-629,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2150.552,2155.956,You do not quite state the question the same way in your brief do you?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2155.956,2158.47,"I am trying to point the distinction, Your Honor."
1983.82-629,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.47,2165.513,"Which question do you think is before the Court, yours or the Petitioners?"
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2165.513,2179.509,"I think our question and this question are fairly close and are before the Court, but what has happened that I think that this question has galloped around in the various briefs."
1983.82-629,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.437,2323.389,Mr. Mc Cutcheon.
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2323.389,2324.045,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-629,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.045,2338.835,"You feel then that the question presented for review in the petition, the one sentence thing, does not include the equal protection argument that they now advance in their brief?"
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2338.835,2341.005,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1983.82-629,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.55,2351.596,There are two requirements for us to consider something.
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2360.0,2371.603,"--It was reached by the court below, but I believe that there has been extraneous or extra material now brought into this argument."
1983.82-629,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2535.537,2538.536,"Well, North Dakota certainly thought it was, did it not?"
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2538.536,2552.187,"Yes, but North Dakota was wrong and North Dakota, the Supreme Court of North Dakota and they were wrong under the test in Williams v. Lee."
1983.82-629,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2780.174,2788.593,Do you agree with the answer given to my question to your opposing counsel that this leaves these Indians without a forum in this case?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2788.593,2820.016,"--Yes, sir, I do, but I do not believe that that is discriminatory in any manner because it is my belief from the cases that I have read of this Court where this Court says that is not racial discrimination and this Court goes so far in one case... I don't recall the name of the case right at the moment... as to answer that precise question and it says"
1983.82-629,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2851.753,2853.441,That is a good way to get rid of a law suit is it not?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2853.441,2854.16,"--I'm sorry, sir?"
1983.82-629,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2854.16,2856.486,It is a good way to get rid of a law suit is it not?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2856.486,2861.562,"Sir, jurisdiction can always be accepted."
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.479,2914.26,Does that apply to any other group of people in North Dakota?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2914.26,2915.088,"No, sir."
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.088,2917.399,Only Indians?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2917.399,2917.789,280.
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.789,2919.366,Only Indians?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2919.366,2922.536,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-629,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.486,2978.702,"Mr. McCutcheon, you said a moment ago that in Gourneau the Supreme Court of North Dakota stated that it had overruled White Shield."
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,2983.451,2980.483,I'm sorry.
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3533.182,3534.369,You emphasized dependent status.
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,3534.369,3534.854,--Yes.
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3534.854,3540.351,How do you ever expect them to get independent status if they are free to be robbed?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,3540.351,3545.113,"Sir, I do not believe they are free to be robbed."
1983.82-629,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3579.211,3590.549,I hope you do not think my silence means I agree with you.
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,3590.549,3595.079,"Sir, I am used to having judges disagree with me."
1983.82-629,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3673.984,3676.296,Why not?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,3676.296,3681.527,I'm sorry?
1983.82-629,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3681.527,3682.339,Why not?
1983.82-629,2,26740,hugh_mc_cutcheon,,3682.339,3694.851,Because it is not yet established that the plaintiff can recover a judgment.
1983.82-629,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3829.686,3832.857,"Thank you, gentlemen."
