1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.418,We'll hear arguments next in Elkins against Moreno.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,41.561,44.858,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.205,272.404,What do you mean by permanent residents?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,278.83,288.475,"That -- that is correct, that is a reference to Section 1101 (a) (20) of Title 20 of the United States Code."
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.475,293.392,Where you will get to it but that probably has too much connection with domiciles.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,293.392,331.582,"Well, if the Court please, I think it was -- has been suggested both by the Court's majority opinion in Nyquist against Mauclet last term and particularly by Mr. Justice Rehnquist's dissent in that case that aliens who are nonimmigrants are under a disability from being domiciled in this country or at least most categories of aliens who are nonimmigrants and for that matter that is a factor which is conceded by the respondents in this case as I'll connote later during the argument."
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.567,369.343,With your position is that the United States has never admitted these people for permanent residence?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,369.343,370.442,That -- that is correct --
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,370.442,371.759,Only temporary.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,371.759,388.447,I -- I think that is clear from the conditions of their admission to this country both by virtue of their nonimmigrant status and by virtue of the regulation prescribed by the Attorney General requiring them to depart at the conclusion of their authorized admission.
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.447,392.416,Are they authorized to become citizens?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,394.899,395.395,I think --
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,395.395,398.58,-- while they're in their status?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,398.58,402.519,-- they would not be authorized to apply for citizenship while in this status.
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.87,416.408,Presumably they could only apply but they could not become citizen you are saying while they are in their status?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,416.408,417.944,That is correct.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.879,443.229,"Well, Mr. Feldman, you say in its unvarnished state, at least you're older in that position here is not as -- that this case is different than Vlandis against Kline."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,443.229,443.63,Yes.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.024,482.088,"In -- in other words, you would be saying that for purposes of Maryland in-state tuition regulations and nonimmigrant alien simply by definition can't qualify."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,482.088,483.518,"That is correct, that is the position --"
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.518,494.185,"And if you measure entitlement by domicile, by definition, the Maryland can say that you can never be a domicile here because of the federal law."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,494.185,495.398,That is our position.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.398,507.563,"And therefore a Vlandis type inquiry, at least under this hypothesis, which shed no light on anything at this state uses in the term making its decision."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,507.563,527.665,"Well, I think the Vlandis type inquiry does not preclude the state from shelling that there are legitimate policy objectives of the state in constructing its policy and in essentially defining domicile in such a way as to preclude these persons consistent with federal law --"
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.665,530.382,The presumption is always true as Brother Rehnquist says.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,533.276,533.838,That is our position.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.838,542.793,"When I said Vlandis type inquiry, I meant the type of inquiry mandated in Vlandis to consider individual circumstances."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,559.266,566.952,"That would be true, only so long as those persons did not adjust their status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residents --"
1977.77-154,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.952,573.53,"Mr. Feldman, in that connection, I want to be sure I understand your position."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,624.73,628.957,"Well, I think it is entirely possible that the University would change its policy."
1977.77-154,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.657,655.198,--(Voice Overlap) this case.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,673.781,691.636,That -- that would be true only if the University's only objective in having its policy with the determined domicile and the point that I've been trying to make to Your Honor is there are other legitimate policy objectives which are taken into account in the University's construction of its policy.
1977.77-154,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,691.636,705.011,"Now did I misapprehend that your brief when I thought you were saying that you know more than were following the law of Maryland as to domicile and that under that law, a G-4 could never become a domiciliary of Maryland?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,705.011,714.311,"Well, that is the position of the University but it is further the position of petitioner in this case that that is not the only basis on which the University's policy rests."
1977.77-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,714.311,717.728,Let me get back in a moment to Mr. Feldman.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,730.274,732.443,There are no Maryland decisions one way or the other --
1977.77-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,732.443,738.214,Did you resist the effort to certify to new Court of Appeals that question?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,738.214,760.66,"No, on the contrary, in the District Court and further briefed in the Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit, the University took the position that the federal courts should abstain on the question of whether persons holding G-4 visas were in fact capable of acquiring Maryland domicile in favor of the decision of a Maryland Court."
1977.77-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.66,763.093,"Well, I persist with that position in this Court?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,769.478,770.16,"Yes, this Court could do that."
1977.77-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,770.16,773.807,"And what's your position about that, should we or should we not?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,773.807,778.196,I'm not urging the Court to do that principally because I think the University is --
1977.77-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.196,779.768,"Well, do you object to our doing it?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,779.768,780.935,Certainly not.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.935,798.36,"Well, Mr. Feldman, if there were to be certification, should the question be, what is the general Maryland law of domicile or what policy is the University permitted to adopt with respect to in-state tuition fees under the law of Maryland?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,798.36,813.4,I think it should probably be the latter question because the policy of the University does try to take account of other factors in addition to domicile in determining who appropriately is entitled to the benefit of lower tuition fees.
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.861,842.298,"Well, wouldn't the certification simply ask the Maryland Court of Appeals, whether the regions had the authority under Maryland law to make that decision?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,842.298,848.308,"If that were the question certified to the Court, I would submit that that would be internally appropriate."
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.308,851.306,"Mr. Feldman, let me just clarify one thing on my own mind."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,864.679,887.343,"If the Court, please and if, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stevens please, that that is not entirely the case and the fact that -- or the proof of that is seen by reference to the University's general policy which is reprinted in the brief of petitioner at page 7."
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.331,981.045,"I was under the impression -- maybe I -- I may not have completely followed that, that every person who could establish that he was a domicile, he or she was a domiciliary of Maryland, would be treated as an in-state applicant."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,981.045,987.668,That is only correct in so far as the general classification is concern.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.296,1064.413,Let me ask you -- put the question just a little differently.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1080.89,1094.179,"I think the odds are, are reasonably high that the case would become moot because the University would change its policy, but that policy judgment is one that would be made by the regents."
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.323,1108.798,"You said that if it changed its policy, wouldn't it just apply its existing policy and say that some of these people would then be eligible to be considered?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1108.798,1119.847,It would not because the existing policy specifically precludes from eligibility persons not United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.551,1179.342,"Mr. Feldman, I'm sorry it takes so much time, but I -– I really -- I don't –- I don't understand."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1192.118,1209.454,Because 1(a) is a specific subcategory of one which limits A and specifically says it is only the policy with respect to United States citizens and to immigrant aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.481,1221.466,"Oh, I see.I see."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1221.466,1235.826,As this Court indicated last term Califano versus Jobst state classifications are not gauged properly by focusing on selected atypical examples of the class.
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1502.428,1510.79,"Mr. Feldman, did the District Court find that the -- what the Maryland law was with respect to domicile?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1510.79,1517.712,The District Court took the position that under the Maryland law of domicile G-4s were not precluded from being domiciled in Maryland.
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1517.712,1525.607,So the -- the District Court – the District Court has already answered the question that – that there has been a suggestion it should be certified to the Maryland Court.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1525.607,1532.611,That it -- it has answered the first question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested was a possibility.
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1540.586,1554.172,"As the -- the District Court though has says that under -- as it understands Maryland law, G-4s are not forbidden or not precluded from becoming domiciliaries."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1554.172,1557.008,"That -- that was the District Court's conclusion, that's correct."
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1557.008,1564.732,"And the -- you -- you disagree with that interpretation in Maryland law, I take it?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1564.732,1566.161,"That -- that is also correct, Your Honor."
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1566.161,1575.027,"But then, why should we -- if we -- let's assume we were just bound with -- to the -- to take the District Court's view on Maryland law, what should we do?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1576.586,1589.645,"No, I don't believe that's to be the case and that's the point I'm trying to make now namely that the University's policies served many purposes other than measuring domicile and I'm trying to get to those in the few brief seconds that I have."
1977.77-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1589.645,1594.837,Well that the – did the District Court reach -- didn't reach those questions?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1594.837,1609.841,"That is right because on the District Court's finding, it determined that there was a permanent irrebuttable presumption under Vlandis without -- that was not universally true, without reference to the later cases which cast out on those requirements."
1977.77-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.841,1618.367,"Well, isn't your position also the University's position by the rule is not necessarily the same as the Maryland law of domicile?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1618.367,1620.695,"That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.044,1631.568,"And the District Court didn't treat that aspect, did they?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1631.568,1635.083,"No, the District Court never -- never reach those questions because of its --"
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.083,1638.005,You have only about four minutes left now to make that point.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1639.56,1641.633,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.311,1709.183,"Mr. Feldman, I don't understand how a service of policy have been encouraging the payment of taxes."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1713.143,1720.139,The University's policy as a general matter --
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.139,1724.586,"Do you think somebody is putting the favor, not pay his taxes depending on the result of this case?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1724.586,1753.715,"No, the point that I'm trying to make Mr. Justice Stevens is that those persons who have given preferential treatment by the university are those liable for the full payment of the full spectrum of -- of state taxes, whereas those who are not favored out of staters, nonimmigrant aliens, those who pass through the State for short periods or in the case of the G-4s are not liable for taxes don't receive the benefit for that reason --"
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.715,1753.719,"Well, in the case of any –"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1753.719,1757.428,-- because the case is already subsidizing them by not charging them income taxes.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.428,1766.48,"In the case of any permanent resident alien or any citizen, the question of whether or not he pays any taxes is totally irrelevant to your standards of whether it is admitted, isn't that true?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1766.48,1774.337,It -- it is not totally irrelevant because it is generally those persons who are liable to -- for the full spectrum of taxes who were given the preferential treatment.
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.877,1793.159,"Well, have not our cases taken known to the fact that they are liable for taxes, liable for military duty if they're here as permanent residents?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1793.159,1796.143,"Yes, that is specifically the point that was made in Nyquist against Mauclet --"
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.143,1797.378,Would these people be --
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1797.378,1798.097,Mauclet.
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.097,1802.386,Would these people be subject to compulsory military service if we had it?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1802.386,1803.98,"No, the -- these people would not because it --"
1977.77-154,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.98,1804.789,But how do we know?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1808.818,1810.344,These people I think it is clear (Inaudible) by treaty.
1977.77-154,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.344,1815.916,"And if we do have it, it will require Congress to enact another law and we don't know what that law would -- could possibly be and could we possibly know."
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.916,1822.247,"On the basis of the past law, you are certainly entitled to make that representation if that's your view of the matter."
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1822.247,1833.176,"Well, I –- I think that it is clear that under the present law persons who are here on G-4 visas are not liable for military service or not liable for federal or state --"
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.176,1835.756,There is no compulsory in military service now of course.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1835.756,1837.231,That is – that would be true even if they would --
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1837.231,1845.667,Your position is that on the law as the last -- was before the change there would be -- there would not be liable for military service.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1845.667,1847.441,That is correct.
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.441,1868.517,"Am I under misapprehension, but are there not immigrant aliens who enjoy income tax immunity and nevertheless able to qualifies in-state students in Maryland?"
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1868.517,1874.385,I think it is true that there are immigrant aliens who enjoy income tax liability.
1977.77-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.349,1879.618,-- immunity exception.
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1879.618,1880.826,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1977.77-154,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.826,1881.194,You said --
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.194,1883.079,You enjoy income tax immunity?
1977.77-154,0,20851,david_h_feldman,,1883.079,1884.777,I -- I misspoke myself.
1977.77-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.176,1932.591,(Inaudible)
1977.77-154,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.591,1935.343,Mr. Scanlan.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1935.343,1938.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.77-154,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1995.792,2001.205,"Well, would it make any difference to this case if they had a million dollar in estate out in the country or somewhere?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2001.205,2009.756,"Well, I could see where would make it -- there would be a difference in the ability to show domicile if you have chateau in Bolivia and return there every year."

1977.77-154,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2131.981,2142.419,"Mr. Scanlan, do you think we are to certify this in the Court of Appeals of Maryland to find out whether or not G-4 immigrants can acquire domicile in Maryland?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2142.419,2145.715,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan I don't for the following reasons."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.801,2178.358,But that isn't permanent.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2178.358,2185.183,"Oh, yes it's an intent, an intent permanently and indefinitely to live with the United States and not to repair elsewhere."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.183,2189.049,"Well, how could it be permanent if it's subject to be withdrawn at anytime?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2189.049,2190.9,"Well, there are many times when you --"
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.9,2193.195,How can it be permanent?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2193.195,2196.904,It can be permanent in the sense that the present time you tend to live in this place and no other place.
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.904,2199.515,It can be permanent because of the present time.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2201.278,2207.882,"Well, in -- among the category of aliens Mr. Justice Marshall, among the category of non-permanent resident aliens."

1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.072,2248.002,Would they end up permanent?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2248.002,2253.181,"Well, if the fire occurred where I live now, I might have to move but that's an unlikely contingency."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.915,2271.703,"Well, I suppose the middle level IBM executive for example that has moved 10 times in the last 10 years and expects to move 10 times more, and come to reside in Maryland for -- he thinks probably as hitch there will be two years."

1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2275.496,2276.423,He is domicile in Maryland.

1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2358.355,2359.365,That's right.
1977.77-154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.741,2369.711,"I think that was a quotation, else."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2369.711,2377.338,"Now, may I turn to a passing the equal protection point which I -- let me put it this way."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2417.705,2421.63,But so far this record show they will never be eligible.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2421.63,2423.744,"Oh no, Your Honor, when they -- when they reach for --"
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.744,2426.085,So far as this record go.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2426.085,2428.171,"Well, I'm not sure about that, Your Honor --"
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.171,2431.893,I thought that was you're complaining about that they didn't give a chance to make the records.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2431.893,2432.477,Oh I see.
1977.77-154,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.179,2518.246,"Well, is that any different from saying that the children or the ambassador of France can stay here as long as the father is an ambassador?"
1977.77-154,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.284,2519.465,Fundamentally any different?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2519.465,2524.652,"Well, the -- the ambassadorial status Mr. Chief Justice is -- is a different category --"
1977.77-154,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.652,2527.591,"Yes, it's different but their both derived from treaties or convention."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2527.591,2530.627,"Yes, but the -- the ambassador status is like a capital office."
1977.77-154,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2587.858,2599.282,But aren't all those things is an indications of the transitory nature of the -- of the -- of bold or whatever term you want to picture with the -- just positive ones?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2599.282,2608.891,"Well, I think they're -- they -- well, the functional privileges are necessary for them to perform their functions as an international civil servant, serving an international agency."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.729,2709.78,"Mr. Scanlan, can I -- can I interrupt for you for a moment?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2725.071,2726.75,"Oh no -- oh no, Your Honor."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.097,2757.677,"Well, but let me -- let me pursue it just a moment if I may."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2791.865,2797.464,"Well, the University is -- entitled to draw the line that is drawn namely domicile but it's not entitled to --"
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.464,2803.675,But why isn't it entitled to draw the line permanent resident that just the way the first paragraph where their general policy does?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2805.969,2808.467,Because then they were right back in the equal protection point.
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.143,2844.915,"That really doesn't – that really doesn't quite responded the question, because I think you would conceive that the university would not have to admit all aliens, say, illegal aliens or persons here on a temporary visas, you wouldn't contend that do you?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2844.915,2854.45,"No, I – I would – I would say they'll -- I would – I would concede the classes of aliens of the University would be entitled to say, “Well, on your face, you cannot show your domiciles here."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.45,2854.676,So you further --
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2854.676,2856.815,"Because look, their visa says you have an intention --"
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.815,2860.605,"Well, but the constitution doesn't – doesn't require domicile to be the test."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2861.421,2865.169,"Oh no, I'm not saying the constitution but having, when a legislative body --"
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.169,2869.436,But they have not used -- I used I was under misapprehension before the argument started.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2871.754,2873.051,"Oh, that isn't so Your Honor."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.872,2883.981,"Well, is this general policy quoted on page 7 of the brief?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2883.981,2886.485,"Yes, but the -- yes, that – that is the general policy."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.485,2887.889,That doesn't use domicile doesn't it?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2887.889,2903.683,"Your Honor -- I rely on the -- in fact (Inaudible) themselves speaking in answering a letter -- I think it as for me, I'm – I can't remember for sure."
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.432,2926.784,"If we have choose between a statement of a written general policy and a letter from Dr. Elkins is that -- what is the university policy, which you think we should choose?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2926.784,2935.411,"Well, I think the – the policy as stated doesn't -- maybe doesn't spell out the fact that domicile is the key factor except that the policy contains the definition of domicile."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.411,2941.618,"His letter – his letter on page 22 (a) says, “The tuition rate is determined mainly by domicile.”"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2941.618,2944.401,"Yes, and then he tries to fill in the cost equalization factor."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.909,2964.011,But you would say -- let me just be sure I understand your argument.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2975.398,2977.93,"No, I wouldn't even stop there."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.294,3032.518,Why wouldn't it been equally unfair to the Nicaraguan ambassador?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3032.518,3034.552,Oh you mean the (Inaudible) been here a long time?
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.552,3035.427,Yes.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3035.427,3039.784,"Well, I – I -- let me put it this way."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.865,3062.657,Including their car?
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3062.657,3065.19,Including their car.
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.262,3066.292,As they (Voice Overlap)--
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3066.292,3069.159,They are -- they are obviously -- pardon.
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3069.159,3070.384,As they run into my car.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3070.384,3072.755,"Oh, yes, they –- they are immune."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.758,3075.185,"Well, do I get territorial too?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3075.185,3084.506,"But if one of – one of these plaintiffs, I mean one of these respondents of their fathers, of their mothers hit anybody with the –- their car in Maryland or driving anywhere else, and they were liable, they would pay."
1977.77-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.451,3101.461,"But you're saying there's a constitutional difference between diplomatic immunity for tort liability and bank employee immunity protects liability, the Maryland can't draw the line right there."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3101.461,3104.039,"Well yes I am, I am saying that."
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.039,3112.159,"When you have these hearings Mr. Scanlan, what section of the general policy is it that you offered evidence on that you can comply with?"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3112.159,3112.197,Well --
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3112.197,3115.659,The general policy on page 7 of petitioner's brief.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3115.659,3124.914,We – we offered evidence about car registrations.
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.914,3125.267,Well I -- I don't mean --
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3125.267,3128.251,The criteria that they – we try -- we couldn't obviously satisfy the voting right there.
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.251,3135.581,"You – you -- well, yeah, you couldn't satisfy the criterion that they were immigrant, aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence (Inaudible)"
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3135.581,3143.842,"That's correct, but we offered evidence on the other criteria, they still gave us a hearing even though it was catch 22 situation, of course."
1977.77-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.563,3162.179,"Well, that's like – that's like saying that if a taxi driver statute that requires a minimum age of 21, your – you – your client is 18 you are going for a hearing and they don't listen to his evidence of disqualification because they find out he is not 21."
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3162.179,3175.151,"Well, it is also like the hearing in Stanley where -- I mean not the hearing in Stanley, the Burson versus Bell where there was a pre-suspension of licence hearing but that hearing was meaningless in the case of a non-insured driver."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3323.879,3330.578,"Mr. Scanlan one question on the interpretation of Maryland law, do we have to do that?"

1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.551,3339.097,It's not a state law.
1977.77-154,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,3339.097,3352.201,"Well, this Court held in Bishop verus Wood and where you had a District Court interpretation in a district where he was familiar with the – with the law and that interpretation affirm by the Circuit Court there by divided court."
1977.77-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3363.153,3364.791,By the Fourth Circuit.
