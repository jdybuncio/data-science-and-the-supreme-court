1991.90-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.368,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 90-1278, Indopco v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,12.87,13.921,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.921,16.753,"Mr. Hiegel, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,16.753,18.823,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.948,183.983,Were the investment banking fees contingent on successful completion of the transaction?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,183.983,185.833,"There was a partial contingency, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,211.719,219.005,"Counsel, in the return as filed, only some of the fees and expenses were asserted."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,219.005,220.595,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.595,221.747,Why weren't all of them?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,221.747,226.339,"I... the record does not show why, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,233.224,233.945,Does that indicate--
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,233.945,234.366,--Why that happened.
1991.90-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,234.366,236.748,--Does that indicate the taxpayer felt they were not deductible?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,236.748,242.56,"As I say, I've been told that it was a mistake, and I do not... I do not know any more than that."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.56,251.296,You said these expenses were ordinarily incurred in a transaction like this.
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,251.296,252.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.297,261.464,"Do you think they would have been generally across the country, or is it... was it just because of the requirements of Delaware law?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,261.464,274.772,"Well, in many... most corporations today, I think, are incorporated in Delaware, or States that have similar laws, and I do not think that there would be any difference in particular jurisdictions."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.772,291.331,"Actually, what... do you think... do you think ordinarily if somebody who wants to acquire a corporation makes an offer to its stockholder... to the... to target stockholders that the corporation goes through this?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,291.331,294.804,"Yes, ordinarily they do, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.804,298.227,And you think whether or not the law requires it?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,298.227,312.916,"I think it's just basic... part of the basic fiduciary responsibility of the board of directors to the shareholders, particularly in a public company, to make a determination as to whether the offer is a reasonable offer and represents a fair price to the stockholders."
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.028,338.522,"Counsel, may I ask, now, what about the expenses of organizing a corporation to get started in business?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,338.522,341.394,"--Those expenses are capitalizable, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.394,346.74,"Well, a special statute was passed, was it, to--"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,346.74,347.859,A special statute--
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.859,348.41,--To allow--
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,348.41,349.922,--was passed to allow 5-year amortization.
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.922,354.944,"--some deduction, and before the passage of that statute, how were those expenses treated?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,354.944,358.057,They were capitalized and no deduction was allowed until final liquidation.
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.057,359.336,And no amortization?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,359.336,360.538,"And no amortization, because--"
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.538,361.589,How about the expense--
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,361.589,362.337,--Excuse me--
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.337,362.748,--Yes.
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,362.748,363.389,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.986,380.149,"I see; and how about expenses of restructuring a corporation, a corporate reorganization?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,380.149,382.182,"Well, that depends, Your Honor, on what you mean by restructuring."
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.295,436.647,So your answer is that there is a split of authority?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,436.647,441.67,In... there is a split of theory on which those cases are based.
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.366,468.347,What about expenses incurred in connection with a hostile takeover?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,468.347,477.264,"Well, the... there have been no cases dealing with hostile takeovers."
1991.90-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.57,519.982,"And if it is not, if it does not occur?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,519.982,528.277,"If it does not occur, then there's no transaction to which that you... no benefit, no transaction occurs, and the expense is a... is a deductible loss."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.288,534.942,It is a deductible loss in the year incurred?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,534.942,538.134,--If the transaction does not incur... does not occur.
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.25,558.437,"Here's the hostile takeover and it... and it comes and goes and is unsuccessful in one year, and the company spends a lot of money opposing it--"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,558.437,559.777,--That would be deductible.
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.777,562.859,--As an... as an ordinary and necessary business expense?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,562.859,563.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.38,566.601,Is that clear?
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,569.653,569.984,"I believe so, yes."
1991.90-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.28,581.913,"Mr. Hiegel, could I go back to Justice Kennedy's question?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,592.879,593.32,That's correct.
1991.90-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.131,601.515,"--In other words, if they had rendered a negative opinion and the negotiations had fallen apart almost immediately, you would have only paid about $ 100, 000?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,601.515,602.116,You're... you're right.
1991.90-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.858,604.487,Well--
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,604.487,606.27,"--It was a lesser figure, that's correct."
1991.90-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.27,615.014,"--If the... if the transaction didn't occur, there would have been a deduction?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,615.014,615.455,Yes.
1991.90-1278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.327,730.139,"You... you don't claim, do you, that Lincoln requires your result in this case?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,730.139,739.896,"--We believe that if you look at the facts of the case and follow the process of reasoning of the Court, that it would require the result in this case."
1991.90-1278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,767.804,770.294,"Sufficient condition, not necessary condition."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,770.294,771.075,--That's correct.
1991.90-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.51,907.505,"But Mr. Hiegel, you've... you've said that... why, you said that these costs in other instances, for example, where they are the costs of restructuring a corporation, are ultimately recoverable when the corporation is dissolved."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,919.814,925.297,"Well, in the first place, Your Honor, on the facts of this case we don't have a corporate restructuring."
1991.90-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.928,929.019,"No, I understand, but you're making a theoretical argument--"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,929.019,929.469,--That's correct.
1991.90-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.469,940.545,"--That unless you use a separate asset theory you can never recover this money, but you can, when the corporation is dissolved, as you do with respect to restructuring expenses."
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,940.545,947.531,"I think restructuring, Your Honor, is an example that... an exception, really, that proves the rule."
1991.90-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.988,959.809,"Well, that must be wrong--"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,959.809,960.21,It's the... it's--
1991.90-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.21,961.231,"--That must be wrong, too, then?"
1991.90-1278,0,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,961.231,967.564,"--Well, as I said before... as I said before, there are two ways of looking at those cases, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1470.105,1474.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.267,1602.2,"What about a hostile takeover, and expenses incurred in connection with that?"
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1602.2,1624.366,"Well, the ordinary way to analyze that, if you're the acquiring party, and you seek a hostile takeover that doesn't succeed, your expenses are deemed to be capital, but they're deducted as a loss in the year that they're incurred... I'm sorry, in the year that the transaction falls apart, and that responds to petitioner's suggestion that you have to have--"
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.366,1627.528,xxx--
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1627.528,1630.771,"--Well, not because an asset has been--"
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.771,1631.652,--Under the Government's theory.
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1631.652,1650.963,"--Under the Government's theory, they are an expense that was incurred to create an asset that was designed to have a future benefit, but when the asset loses its value by the failure to conclude the transaction, at that point in time we recognize the loss that has occurred and allow it to be deducted under 165, not under 162."
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1650.963,1654.926,What about expenses of reorganization or merger?
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1654.926,1661.291,"Well, that... that, of course, is broadly speaking what this case is about."
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1697.815,1705.74,But the initial corporate expenses are treated differently to set up the corporation initially?
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1705.74,1710.603,"Well, prior to 1954, they were treated the same."
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1759.596,1767.02,"But what do you think the test is, Mr. Jones, for knowing what must be capitalized and what isn't?"
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1774.306,1784.651,"--The test is a functional one of properly matching expenses with the years they benefit income, but it's a pragmatic test at the same time."
1991.90-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1793.628,1807.506,"Well, is it possible to articulate the test in any... at any level of generality, and isn't the tax law an area where it's desirable to have some kind of clear standard?"
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1807.506,1812.921,"--It is... it is possible to, as I've already tried to do, articulate the functional test."
1991.90-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.797,1872.688,"Mr. Jones, what happens... what happens in this case if Unilever later disposes of this company, so that the value that you think has been acquired in this transaction, the value of the association with Unilever, disappears."
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1876.272,1890.449,"--Well, I'm not dodging the question, I'll try to answer it, but I think it should be emphasized that that isn't presented here, and the reason that should be emphasized is because it depends... it depends on future events exactly how that transaction should be characterized."
1991.90-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.977,1935.189,"Well, if Unilever disposed of this company, they would be selling the stock, I suppose."
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1935.189,1936.791,If Unilever--
1991.90-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.791,1943.865,And I thought the question was... was whether this is deductible by the subsidiary.
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1943.865,1947.708,"--I think you're absolutely right, and I was trying to answer a different question."
1991.90-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.708,1949.578,"Yes, you were answering a different question."
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1949.578,1949.989,Right.
1991.90-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.326,1974.816,"Yes, but... yes, but you say that... you say that what they have acquired, that the long-term asset they've acquired is the asset of the close association with Unilever, which gives them all sorts of... all sorts of benefits."
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1976.266,1976.706,--It does.
1991.90-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.706,1981.061,"--you describe it in your brief, so I'm saying, what happens when Unilever says, get out, you know, we're selling it to somebody else?"
1991.90-1278,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1981.061,1986.704,There are three types of benefits that are... that are acquired by Indopco in this reorganization.
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3001.839,3016.909,I'd like to return to a point that Mr. Jones... an answer to Justice Scalia's question concerning hostile takeovers.
1991.90-1278,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.3,3098.091,"You would allow that loss if they allowed it, I suppose."
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3098.091,3102.725,"--No, we would not, Your Honor, but I think it illuminates the flaw in their theory."
1991.90-1278,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.878,3113.691,"Well, you may have trouble identifying the property, but you wouldn't have any trouble at all in finding out what it cost."
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3113.691,3117.755,"That's correct, whatever it is, whatever it is, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3117.755,3120.626,"Well, but do you claim it's an ordinary and necessary business expense under 162?"
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3120.626,3121.067,Yes.
1991.90-1278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3247.43,3249.41,"Well... well, isn't there a separate section for research and development?"
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3249.41,3254.453,"Research and development is a separate section, that's correct, because there you would have an asset."
1991.90-1278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3256.717,3258.376,"Well, you might or might not, depending on how the research comes out."
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3258.376,3258.787,--That's... that's correct.
1991.90-1278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3281.35,3285.915,"Well, I'm not sure how to distinguish that between your strategic planning, from your strategic planning example."
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3285.915,3296.771,"My strategic planning... it is deductible without regard to any special section of the code, without regard to any such section as section 174, because there is no asset created."
1991.90-1278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.771,3298.764,"Thank you, Mr. Hiegel."
1991.90-1278,2,39434,richard_j_hiegel,,3298.764,3299.866,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-1278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.866,3300.477,The case is submitted.
