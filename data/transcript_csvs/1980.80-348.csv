1980.80-348,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.559,We will hear arguments next in H. A. Artists and Associates v. Actors' Equity.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,31.285,34.658,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.771,192.578,I gather then that if an agent all year long never got a job for any of his clients above scale he wouldn't make anything?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,192.578,193.75,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.75,200.918,"And that isn't very likely, though, is it?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,200.918,218.21,"It isn't very likely because most of the agents will also place actors in non-Equity jobs, but there are many petitioners who place a lot of actors in scale jobs; scale jobs predominate over non-scale jobs."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.21,221.989,"So, why will agents do that for nothing?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,221.989,232.5,"Well, they will do it for nothing because the actors are their clients, they want to accommodate these actors, they hope that maybe some day an actor will become a star."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,234.499,239.84,And then he'll be paid a good deal above scale and he could make up to ten percent?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,239.84,241.2,--If he stays with him.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.681,290.367,Do producers ever pay agents?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,290.367,293.303,--It's strictly prohibited.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.303,294.663,By whom?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,294.663,296.037,By the Equity's--
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.037,297.724,Under state law or by... or both?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,297.724,302.581,"--Well, I believe it's prohibited by Equity's rules and by-laws."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.581,312.296,That's because it necessarily would follow that if they weren't paying the agent maybe they would have paid the actor?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,312.296,316.84,"Well, I think the basic reason is there's no need for producers to pay agents."
1980.80-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.745,407.368,"Mr. Breindel, before you get to that, am I correct in thinking the Court of Appeals made no finding as to whether this conduct was a violation of the Antitrust Act?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,407.368,408.179,--That's correct.
1980.80-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.179,414.957,It simply went directly to the labor exemption without determining whether the conduct would be actionable under the antitrust laws?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,414.957,415.411,That is correct.
1980.80-348,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,468.061,473.026,Could you prevail without our overruling Carroll?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,473.026,474.386,I believe so.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.882,657.313,"But if you're right, it would mean that the agent would be free and the actor would be free to let the agent collect, say, ten percent of a scale wage as a commission?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,657.313,658.469,That's correct.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.469,663.201,And that means that the actor is getting less than scale?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,663.201,664.403,I don't believe--
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.403,666.184,He's netting less than scale?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,666.184,672.807,"--Well, he may be... one way of looking at it, he's netting less than scale, but what happens is, an Equity producer pays an actor."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.114,686.738,"And he can't pay him more than ten percent, anyway?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,686.738,691.159,--Not under New York State law which governs each and every petitioner in this action.
1980.80-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.068,768.143,Is it rather they are licensed under the general New York law of regulating kickbacks by employment agencies?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,768.143,777.89,"--No, Your Honor, there is a specific law which licenses employment agencies which has very specific provisions dealing with the actual employment agencies."
1980.80-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.89,790.603,"Well, is it a type of law such as that that was originally invalidated in the '20s by the case of Ribnik v. McBride--"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,790.603,791.836,"Yes, it is."
1980.80-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.836,794.741,"--And then later, of that case being later overruled by the Olson case?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,794.741,795.85,"It is, precisely."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.932,989.929,"Well, what if there were proof like that?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,989.929,997.021,"If there was proof like that, it might support the Court of Appeals's conclusion that it's necessary to regulate agents' commissions."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.021,998.8,You mean its conclusion that this is within the exemption?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,998.8,1000.191,Yes.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.191,1018.137,"You mean, if there was evidence that there was competition among actors in the sense that one, some actors would offer agents five percent, and others eight percent, and others nine percent, and others ten percent?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1020.075,1023.807,"Well, I think that's the kind of competition the union has been talking about."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.807,1026.899,"Well, suppose there was proof that that would happen, absent this system?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1033.099,1036.848,"I would say, no, Your Honor, because the elimination of wage competition--"
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.848,1041.8,"Well, then, you should argue that even if the Court of Appeals was correct, their conclusion doesn't follow?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1041.8,1065.555,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and it doesn't follow, because the elimination of wage competition, which is a traditional union labor objective, is the kind of elimination of competition between union members involved in dealing with employers, not union members competing for the services of people such as actors who perform services in turn for the union members."
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.903,1099.558,"No, were offering them ten percent when they get paid according to scale."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1099.558,1099.776,That's correct.
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.776,1108.383,"And isn't it almost inevitable that that would happen, that the agents would begin collecting commissions when their clients were being paid scale?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1108.383,1110.444,"I don't know if it's inevitable, Your Honor, for this reason."
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.585,1113.348,"That's what you're complaining about, so I assume--"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1113.348,1130.607,"--Well, the agents are now obtaining scale jobs for union members without any commission whatsoever, so it's reasonable to assume that they might, if the prohibition was struck, they might obtain scale jobs for actors at the commission less than ten percent."
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.247,1144.821,"--Don't we have to presume that if you prevail some, at least some agents will start collecting some commissions when their clients work for scale?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1144.821,1146.538,I think that's a fair presumption.
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.538,1147.241,It seems to me it's inevitable.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1154.66,1158.628,"Well, I think there would be more monies flowing into agents' pockets, but it will soon--"
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.628,1159.659,"There may be more agents, too."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1159.659,1162.719,--It will simply be money that agents have earned.
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.719,1164.126,"Well, I'm not saying it's inequitable."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1169.295,1171.623,"Well, let's turn to a very practical--"
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.623,1173.059,It means you are asking for more competition.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1173.871,1174.184,--Yes.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.51,1226.538,"--But they do, they might engage in competition for agents' services by offering higher commissions."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1226.538,1228.755,"--They might, but there's no evidence of that on this record."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.755,1241.797,Does the amicus brief suggest that actors offer different amounts to agents or not?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1241.797,1245.546,"That's not only suggested, it states it, but without any record cite."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.546,1285.014,"Well, of course, you are the plaintiff in the case and presumably, unless you can point to some federal law that the defendants have violated, you ought not to prevail, and even if you win here on the labor exemption argument, the case still would have to go back to find out whether the practices were a violation of the antitrust laws."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1285.014,1286.42,That's a possibility--
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.42,1290.34,But the courts below just didn't let you get to the merits of the case.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1290.34,1290.933,--That is correct.
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.933,1293.526,They have upheld the affirmative defense of the defendant.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1293.526,1294.557,Exactly.
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.557,1298.321,"And therefore, the merits you haven't reached and--"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1298.321,1308.412,"The merits technically are whether or not the union's franchising agreement is a violation of the Sherman Act, was not decided by either court, although it was fully argued."
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.412,1311.973,--Because the courts below held that the defendants are exempt from the Sherman Act.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1311.973,1313.004,Correct.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.892,1405.965,"And, I take it that unless someone... if somebody says I'll live up to all your rules for the franchise fee, he is then out of business?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1409.12,1409.948,--Exactly.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.962,1421.897,And in which event your argument for a violation of the antitrust laws would be what?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1421.897,1422.833,The argument for--
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.833,1423.911,Say you win.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1426.191,1432.908,"--Well, I would say the union has a legal monopoly over the labor market of its union members."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.367,1462.973,So you think you have to go at it on the monopoly side rather than on any conspiracy or agreement side?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1462.973,1478.843,"Well, in addition to that, Your Honor, I think the franchise agreement between Equity and TARA, which mandates that all franchised agents pay franchise fees is that type of conspiracy or agreement which we are alleging."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.843,1493.539,And it is part of the agreement between... is it a part of the franchise agreement between Equity and the franchised agents--
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1493.539,1494.086,Yes.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.086,1495.133,--That they won't deal with others?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1495.133,1496.616,Absolutely.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.251,1519.217,"So this is an agreement between, you say, between independent businessmen and the union not to deal with other businessmen?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1519.217,1519.325,--Yes.
1980.80-348,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1530.759,1538.661,Do you see any parallel here at all with the union shop structure in the labor field generally?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1538.661,1539.973,--Not really.
1980.80-348,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1563.168,1565.604,How much are those fees?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1565.604,1568.711,"For Equity the franchise fee, the initial franchise fee, is $200."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.069,1579.88,"Well, that's not very much these days."
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1579.88,1587.298,"It's not very much, but for these petitioners' agents, who don't make very much, it seems to be a lot to them."
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1594.155,1595.874,Such as what?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1595.874,1597.498,Thousands of dollars.
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.498,1598.717,What union was that?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1598.717,1600.215,Screen Actors Guild.
1980.80-348,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.215,1600.653,I see.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1600.653,1601.169,SAG.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.964,1605.274,"But they don't... that's a different arrangement, isn't it?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1605.274,1607.196,--It's basically the same.
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.459,1617.301,"They permit, they allow commissions for scale wages?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1617.301,1622.58,"The New York chapter, not the Los Angeles chapter, or the Chicago chapter."
1980.80-348,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.58,1625.563,The New York chapter allows commissions on scale jobs?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1625.563,1625.829,Right.
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.6,1690.366,What do the personal managers do?
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1693.926,1695.895,--That's a disputed issue.
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.267,1707.531,But then they're really not comparable to agents.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1711.42,1714.121,"Theoretically, that is correct."
1980.80-348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.121,1716.84,"They are sort of like a teacher or something like that, would you say?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1716.84,1719.668,"They're a teacher, a confidant, in place--"
1980.80-348,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.668,1720.479,Just like a mother.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1720.479,1722.915,--It's like a stage mother.
1980.80-348,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.915,1728.492,"They go out on the road, they handle the money, they dole the money out, right?"
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1728.492,1728.849,Right.
1980.80-348,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.849,1732.364,And what they don't ever do is manage.
1980.80-348,0,26584,howard_breindel,,1734.38,1745.844,"If the franchising system is struck down, the agents will now be able to bargain with Equity as employers do on equal terms."
1980.80-348,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1818.376,1826.233,"Mr. Lurie, you may proceed when you are ready."
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,1826.233,1830.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the Court:"
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.633,1889.833,"Isn't that true of a lot of employment agencies, or rather employers seeking employees through employment agencies, entirely outside of the actors' field?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,1889.833,1908.935,"--It may be that it is true in some instances, and I would suppose that if there were a union in a similar position where the actors could only get jobs through certain specific employment agencies, that the union would have the right to do something about it."
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.889,1956.352,"The State of New York has addressed it too, has it not, by limiting the amount, or prohibiting any kickbacks to the employer from the employment agency?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,1956.352,1963.116,"What they have done, if your Honor please, is limit commissions to ten percent."
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.397,2001.147,Right.
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2010.191,2010.488,That's right.
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.446,2060.858,"Well, would you say, for the purposes of the exemption, which is what we're arguing, that this case is comparable to what it would be if the producers and the union had had an agreement which provided that the producers would secure actors only through a union, you might call it a hiring hall?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2060.858,2065.95,"If Your Honor please, I think the union would have the right to enter into such an agreement with the producers."
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.95,2066.887,"Well, suppose they did?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2066.887,2068.792,But because of peculiarities of this industry--
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.792,2073.71,"I know, but suppose they did, would it be any more suspect than this one, or any less?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2073.71,2075.07,--I'm sorry.
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.226,2081.161,Would it be any more exempt or any less exempt under the antitrust laws?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2081.161,2082.567,Than this?
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.567,2082.957,Yes.
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2085.067,2087.456,It would be exempt under the antitrust laws.
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.097,2089.33,But no more and no less than?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2089.33,2090.236,--No more and no less.
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.236,2093.158,"And it would be prohibited in an open shop state, would it not?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2095.86,2096.391,Yes.
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.391,2102.311,--Would it be legal if the agreement provided that the costs of operating the hiring hall be paid by the employers?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2102.311,2126.425,"Well, I think that the National Labor Relations Board has often ruled in this matter that if the employers contribute toward the hiring hall an amount which relates, or, for example, an employee, those hiring halls have to be without discrimination and any individual theoretically can walk in and be sent out, and he can be charged a fee commensurate with the cost of operating his share of the hiring."
1980.80-348,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.425,2134.078,"Well, is the $200 initiation fee and the $60 annual fee in your view somewhat comparable to that?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2134.078,2135.625,"Well, if Your Honor please, absolutely."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.771,2165.58,"Mr. Lurie, would your theory make it appropriate for a union to franchise acting teachers?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2165.58,2169.469,"No, it would not, if Your Honor please."
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2227.29,2231.524,Would you say disciplining your members meant imposition of a fine such as--
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2231.524,2239.972,"If Your Honor please, disciplining our members means anything which is permissible and reasonable under the internal... in accordance with the constitution of the union."
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.972,2247.344,--And under our Boeing decision which leaves the substantiality of the fine to the state courts?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2247.344,2250.031,Yes.
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.587,2314.928,Isn't there... the agents who are franchised don't insist that the union not deal with other agents?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2314.928,2320.394,"--The agency agreement does say, but we--"
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.394,2326.906,"Yes, so there is an agreement, whether you call it a conspiracy or not, that they won't deal with other agents who won't pay the franchise fee."
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2326.906,2342.526,"--There is an agreement, if Your Honor please, but let me say, number one, that there is no evidence in this case that anybody or any agent who is prepared to meet and conform with the regulations cannot be licensed."
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.526,2356.551,"Would you think it would be different for purposes of the exemption if it were otherwise, that the union simply made an agreement with a group of agents not to deal with anybody else, even if they were willing to live up to all the rules?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2356.551,2358.456,"Well, let me say that--"
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.456,2360.674,But is it any different?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2360.674,2362.44,"--Yes, I would think that that would change the situation."
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.545,2376.059,"But that isn't this case, is it?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2380.027,2380.449,"Well, if Your Honor--"
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.449,2383.901,"Because isn't it inevitably true that when you don't allow that to happen, There are fewer agents?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2383.901,2388.742,"--Well, I suppose that it is possible."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.727,2390.476,So it is not in your interest to maximize the number of agents.
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2390.476,2406.328,"--If Your Honor please, there is no evidence in this case that I know of that any agent has ever been denied access... has not come into the agency business because of that, or that any agent has ever dropped out because of that."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.328,2418.777,"Well, but isn't it simple economics, as I suggested to your learned opponent, that if you cut off one major source of income into the industry, namely, commissions on people who work at scale, and lots of people work at scale, don't they?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2423.806,2433.678,"If Your Honor please, I think it is... it's not in the record, but I think it's clear in the theatrical industry that people work for scale actors not because they want to."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.921,2490.903,I was questioning your argument that you desired to increase competition.
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2495.621,2498.276,"Well, if Your Honor please, I didn't say we didn't have a right to do this."
1980.80-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.37,2547.569,"Wasn't that partly because this Court had then held that New York State couldn't regulate employment agencies, or agents?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2547.569,2560.344,"--Well, if your Honor please, first, what happened was that Equity in an effort to avoid the abuses which were so prevalent lobbied for the passage of the New York State law."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.338,2622.914,May I just ask one more question.
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2636.191,2638.845,"If Your Honor please, there are two... correct."
1980.80-348,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.639,2690.683,"Mr. Lurie, before you sit down, just as a matter of personal curiosity, how old a union is Equity?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2690.683,2695.432,Equity was formed around the turn of the century.
1980.80-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.216,2728.34,Even Sarah Bernhardt had problems?
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2728.34,2730.792,I'm afraid I'm not that old.
1980.80-348,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2730.792,2734.509,"Has it always had the name, Equity?"
1980.80-348,1,31525,jerome_b_lurie,,2734.509,2737.18,Actors' Equity Association; I think so.
1980.80-348,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2742.631,2745.178,Very well.
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2754.409,2758.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.459,2835.797,"Mr. Gold, what about the fact in Carroll that the orchestra leaders there actually played as musicians with the dance bands?"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2840.358,2859.506,"For the purpose here we think it is irrelevant because Carroll concerned many issues and one issue was the extent to which you could, to which the union could regulate the orchestra leaders."
1980.80-348,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2912.406,2921.81,What about the emphasis that your brother Breindel puts on the collective bargaining agreement between the producers and Equity?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2923.246,2947.126,"--That point is treated in the brief of the union, and the record in the Carroll case shows that there were collective agreements in the steady engagement field in Carroll, and that was covered by musicians' booking agents' rules just as the rest of the engagements were covered."
1980.80-348,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2947.126,2948.642,And Carroll made no distinction?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2948.642,2951.422,And Carroll made absolutely no distinction.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.934,2964.042,What about the fee?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2964.042,2999.169,"Well, my view on the fee is that if the rest of the system were in any way suspect that might not stand, but if we are correct that the whole point and purpose of the system is employee protective, we certainly believe that the fee which barely covers the cost of the system would be lawful."
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.169,3001.808,Should be paid for by the--
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3001.808,3003.073,In part.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.073,3004.917,--By the agents?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3004.917,3010.554,"Let me... you raised the question, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist--"
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.554,3012.538,That certainly wasn't covered by Carroll.
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3012.538,3014.802,"--No, I would agree entirely."
1980.80-348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.673,3033.498,"When you say, if this system were suspect, the presence of the fee might render it--"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3033.498,3036.2,"No, no, Your Honor, I didn't mean to say that."
1980.80-348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.302,3091.958,--But here the employer doesn't--
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3091.958,3098.191,"Because if it's the employer who pays, or it isn't the agents who pay in this instance, then it's the members who pay."
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.621,3117.699,"--Mr. Gold, I'm just curious."
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3161.196,3176.315,"I'm not positive where the line is but I can indicate what we think the theory is, and what we understand the basic point of the labor exemption to be."
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.568,3207.364,"And in my example, that's not the labor market."
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3207.364,3216.064,It would seem to me that was certainly stretching the concept of the employees' labor market to its very end.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.064,3218.235,It may not violate the antitrust laws but it does--
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3218.235,3229.434,"That's correct, but in this instance what we rely on very heavily is that we're in the heart and soul of these employees' job market."
1980.80-348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.877,3257.97,"--Actually, neither are express statutory exemptions."
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3262.405,3266.997,We think they're all express.
1980.80-348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.635,3275.04,"--One is no more express than the other, though?"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3275.04,3275.759,No.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.865,3326.973,"Well, do you say the same, Mr. Gold, if access was limited here, if only a selected group of agents were franchised?"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3326.973,3338.14,That depends on the test you apply to determine what the meaning of the labor exemption is.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.607,3349.417,I agree with you but now suppose the agents have... what's their organization?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3349.417,3350.527,TARA.
1980.80-348,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.527,3350.823,TARA.
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3361.239,3369.174,I think we would have to show that the union was operating to advance a direct and immediate interest.
1980.80-348,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3404.223,3414.079,"Mr. Gold, before you sit down, you touched upon this distinction between focusing on the labor market and on the other hand, on the product market."
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3421.233,3422.279,--Yes.
1980.80-348,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3439.538,3443.161,Does his opinion really make that distinction?
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3452.188,3473.086,"--I read his opinion to say, if the issue is of direct and immediate union concern, and there the direct and immediate union labor market concern was the desire of those employees not to work at night; the fact that there is also an effect on the product market is not sufficient."
1980.80-348,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3526.096,3527.987,"Mr. Gold, what is your second case?"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3533.203,3539.669,"I think that some of the academic commentary doesn't do the opinions justice, necessarily--"
1980.80-348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3539.669,3542.2,"Mr. Gold, I wanted to ask perhaps two questions."
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3542.2,3565.815,"--I was going to say that Mr. Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in that case, he notes that the center of the labor exemption is where the union is attempting to regulate in order to prevent wage and job competition among its members in its labor market, and we think that that's important."
1980.80-348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.05,3572.36,"The question, I guess, then is whether the agents are in... in which market are the agents placed?"
1980.80-348,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3572.36,3585.98,"--Well, you're going to have, in effect... we make an argument, it's point two of our amicus brief, that an agent because he deals in the services of employees doesn't really have a product market in the classic sense."
1980.80-348,3,26584,howard_breindel,,3626.98,3627.792,Yes.
1980.80-348,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.792,3628.886,You have one minute left.
1980.80-348,3,26584,howard_breindel,,3628.886,3633.773,"Very briefly, in connection with Mr. Lurie's statement that there was no--"
1980.80-348,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3633.773,3635.68,"You'd better get over to the microphone, there."
1980.80-348,3,26584,howard_breindel,,3635.68,3650.953,"--In connection with Mr. Lurie's statement that there was no evidence in the record that he was aware of that agents are leaving the field or are reluctant to enter it, let me quote from page 196 of the Joint Appendix, which is a letter from the president of TARA to Equity."
1980.80-348,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3693.843,3703.136,Could I ask you one... do you think all decisions to move from New York to the West coast are motivated by Actors' Equity practices?
1980.80-348,3,26584,howard_breindel,,3703.136,3703.589,"No, I don't."
1980.80-348,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3703.589,3706.728,"Thank you, gentlemen."
