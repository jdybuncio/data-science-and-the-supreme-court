1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,738.766,743.674,"No, it didn't because -- because it's only payable after his death."
1963.61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.773,748.468,I'm talking about the cash surrender value --
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,748.468,748.502,Yes Your Honor.
1963.61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.502,750.927,-- in which persist property during his lifetime?
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,750.927,751.576,It is.
1963.61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.576,758.919,"In which event -- in which event both the bank, I'm suggesting both the bank and the Government had a lien on the cash surrender value."
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,758.919,760.92,"Well, the only difference is this, --"
1963.61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.92,767.095,"But if the loan has been paid, certainly the -- you wouldn't suggest for a minute that the Government did not have a lien."
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,773.181,774.256,"Yes, it would."
1963.61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.02,784.391,I know.

1963.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,801.082,812.664,"Well I gather your point is that as long as the insured lives, if the bank had to collect its loan, they could collect it only out of the insurance or the cash surrender value, is that it?"
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,812.664,814.217,"No, Your Honor, it could collect to that --"

1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,823.051,825.662,Yes.
1963.61,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.043,836.839,"And then for this reason you say that at the time that the federal tax lien attached, there was no cash surrender value in his lifetime to which it could've had?"
1963.61,0,42153,samuel_w_sherman,,836.839,838.159,"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1405.518,1410.597,If it please the Court.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1566.014,1567.666,If they were there.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1567.666,1570.064,"Well, one was clearly on part of the proceeds --"
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1570.064,1572.029,"On -- on just cash, they're in the value."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1572.029,1576.078,"Cash value, the other, subject to a single lien."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1580.783,1586.526,Did the Government get a lien on something she -- she didn't own -- he didn't own and never did own?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1586.526,1589.326,"But if the Court please, I would say, --"
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1589.326,1593.585,Except by a formulation which occurs in that Behrens case --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1593.585,1593.867,"No, sir."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1593.867,1594.775,-- which have ignores the fact --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1594.775,1595.168,No.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1595.168,1597.67,"-- that the contract was made in New York, wasn't it?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1597.67,1598.213,Yes.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1598.213,1600.462,And governed by New York laws --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1600.462,1600.538,"Yes, sir."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1600.538,1601.358,-- the part of it.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1601.358,1601.857,Yes sir.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1601.857,1610.624,"And the very time the contract was made, it meant that she would get that part that exempt to her under New York laws."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1610.624,1615.29,"If -- if she remained a beneficiary at the time of death, but may I -- may I take a point --"
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1615.29,1616.525,"But she did, (Inaudible)"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1616.525,1620.551,"She did but may I take a point as to one statement Your Honor made, Justice Black."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1654.977,1658.164,He didn't assign it to the bank security for his tax.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1658.164,1658.815,I beg your pardon sir?
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1658.815,1661.602,He didn't assign it to the bank as security for his tax.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1663.104,1663.56,I understand that.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1663.56,1668.896,"-- on his -- his right to have done so if he had done it, he wouldn't have done much that way."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1668.896,1669.469,That's right.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1734.683,1735.349,"However, you get it."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1740.089,1743.718,"Oh, I can get from New York law and -- in two respects."
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1772.363,1783.012,"I take it then if -- if this insurer had not made the contract with the bank -- the bank, you may collect out of the proceeds of the policy."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1790.481,1791.817,That's right.
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.001,1798.42,But the only reason you are here is that the contract he made with the bank allowed the bank to collect out of the proceeds.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1798.42,1803.045,"Or if I may put it in my way, the contract he made with the bank provided another fund to pay the banks."
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1803.284,1823.796,"Well, the fact is though I gather somewhat -- your adversary said that under New York law, the property or the -- the proceeds would attempt and exempt from the final creditors, what more the insurer agreement with the bank if the bank could collect that at first?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1823.796,1825.181,"Well, but that's the very glide effect the creditor (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.181,1826.605,"No, I -- I understand it, yes."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1829.502,1829.769,Yes.
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.769,1832.677,-- I think if the New York law provision which accepts --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1832.677,1833.368,Yes.
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1833.368,1836.594,-- that proceeds from it there by (Inaudible) of the States.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1836.594,1837.317,Yes.
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1841.779,1842.317,"Yes, I understand that."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1844.806,1847.579,"Well, I -- I think, yes he does."
1963.61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.049,1871.639,"Well, you said -- is it your position that the New York law does govern this all matter?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1871.639,1872.18,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1963.61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.18,1880.967,Is it your position that the New York law does govern this matter on whether marshaling applies or whether it doesn't or what assets would be exempt?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1880.967,1881.242,No.
1963.61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.219,1897.792,Yes.
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.792,1898.634,On this fact.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1900.346,1901.53,"Yes, as such, it doesn't apply to that thing."
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1901.53,1903.041,"No, but that doesn't disregard marshaling."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1904.289,1904.818,"No, even disregards --"
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.818,1905.887,It does apply here --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1905.887,1906.224,"No, it doesn't apply here."
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1906.224,1907.27,-- by the facts.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1907.27,1908.657,"On these facts, it's not applicable at all."
1963.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1908.657,1909.49,Yes.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1909.49,1911.036,Not in this case.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1942.334,1943.145,Of the what?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1943.145,1946.228,To a payment of his debt.
1963.61,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1989.209,1996.209,(Inaudible)
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,1996.209,1997.261,It could -- yes.
1963.61,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1999.743,2001.918,We have that 1449 (Inaudible)
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2001.918,2003.996,"Well, Justice Goldberg, the --"
1963.61,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2003.996,2006.003,But I think (Inaudible)
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2017.734,2006.003,We don't know.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2020.52,2028.74,"If this giving us security for the bank and made it liable for the debt, why are limited to the bank?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2034.465,2034.879,"Well, that's a --"
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2034.879,2035.917,-- subject to creditors?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2035.917,2037.866,Because the creditors would be bound.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2047.898,2055.286,"In other words that -- having no agreement from him to pay them, they couldn't recover but the Government having no agreement from him can recover."
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2055.286,2056.025,"Look quite, sir."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2059.266,2062.15,How -- why -- did the Government have an agreement with him?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2063.335,2063.773,No.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2063.773,2075.793,If its find any implication that he wanted this by agreeing to make your security to the bank for the debt that he wanted debt to provide for payment of his taxes and take his insurance to witness with it?
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2075.793,2087.018,"Oh, I -- if -- if the Court please, I don't know whether he had that in mind because I don't know those facts but I do say that when he said to the bank, ""I'll see -- I am willing to see toward it."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2095.777,2097.628,For the Government and nobody else.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2097.628,2104.742,"Well, that may be because the Government's tax debt has special rights that a lot -- are barred by state exemption statutes."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2107.241,2110.704,"But it's a little difficult without the committee's exemption, didn't he?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2113.019,2115.721,"Well, I recognize that fee."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2115.721,2116.431,I'm not talking about (Voice Overlap) --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2116.431,2117.178,I'm not saying --
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2117.178,2117.947,-- those loans --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2117.947,2118.106,I'm not --
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2118.106,2120.439,-- they've been given all over the country.
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2120.439,2121.42,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.307,2129.583,"Where's those exemption laws, the effect that they've been given all over the country?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2146.078,2150.441,"Oh, I -- I submit sir, the federal statute governs the exemption state, that will tax."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2160.628,2160.801,But the federal -- federal statutes --
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2160.801,2162.584,-- what he ought to be recognizing could provide.
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2162.584,2169.91,"-- federal statute hasn't said that that New York exemption law cannot be advised in favor of a widow, has it?"
1963.61,1,31288,joseph_kovner,,2169.91,2176.498,"Yes, but it is -- but this Court has said that New York exemption laws in favor of the widow do not bar the federal tax debt."
1963.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2176.498,2179.913,Not if -- not if the -- not if the taxpayer has the money.
