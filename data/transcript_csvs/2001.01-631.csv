2001.01-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.173,"We'll hear argument now in No. 01-631, the United States v. Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,10.774,24.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has held in several decisions that the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and, indeed, vital law enforcement technique."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.356,83.015,"Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had a right to refuse consent?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,83.015,101.386,"That is correct, Your Honor, but also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate."
2001.01-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.899,150.51,"Well, I... I suppose that the advice that you have a right to decline the request applies... and I... I take it you could read Bostick this way; perhaps you disagree... to whether or not the... the consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was a coercive environment."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,150.51,175.113,"That's correct, Your Honor, and as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test to be applied is whether or not, under all the circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a reasonable person... and that presupposes a reasonably... a reasonable innocent person... whether or not the passenger could have refused the officer's request to consent or otherwise have terminated the... terminated the encounter."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.671,199.223,"My question, Mr. Thompson, was your opening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled in direct conflict with this Court's precedent."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,219.324,232.948,"--Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit considered factors that were unlike the factors that this Court in Bostick believed were important in determining whether the police conduct at issue was coercive."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.017,288.881,"Well, it's... it's true that the... the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is... is not really an issue that... that focuses the question, and we said so in Bostick."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,317.655,318.974,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.408,342.297,"He did... nobody said, you can't leave the bus."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,352.328,353.237,Your Honor--
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,353.237,355.316,"He wasn't keeping people out, apparently."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,355.316,357.036,--Excuse me.
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.036,361.616,"It's... it's a relevant fact in determining the coerciveness of the atmosphere, is it not?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,361.616,362.442,"Your Honor, not in this case."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.687,376.066,Let me... let me try a... a different suggestion.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,421.392,443.433,"--Your Honor, the presence of the officer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the context of these facts and if... in the context of this Court's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents surrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply because the factory workers could not leave without passing those agents--"
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.433,444.919,I agree with you.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,467.582,481.866,"--It's a relevant fact, but the factors to be considered and the factors that this Court clearly announced in... in the Bostick case were factors that were threatening, factors that were otherwise coercive, like pointing a gun."
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.64,494.786,"Mr. Thompson, did they know that he was an officer?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,496.189,501.557,--The officer was conducting individual passenger-specific questioning.
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.557,511.132,"The... the other two officers were I know, but was there... was it clear that the person kneeling in the driver's seat was an officer?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,511.132,515.879,"He was casually dressed, Your Honor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or not he was a police officer."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.879,517.82,Did he have his badge?
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,523.393,531.483,I don't believe the record is clear as to where the badge was located with respect to the officer at the front of the bus.
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.483,532.226,--Did he enter with the other two?
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,532.226,533.069,Yes.
2001.01-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,542.053,545.684,"Well, I mean, I... what... I don't know what that... why should that make a difference."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,581.927,595.923,"--Well, that follows on with the... the clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and the test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police conduct commuted anything... communicated anything to the citizens and these passengers as to--"
2001.01-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.923,598.728,What about the proposition as I... as I've stated it?
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,610.245,623.62,"--Well, here... here the... the citizens... some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's request, and what... what you posit is... is really the guts of what is going on here."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.427,675.799,"Did any other case that we considered involve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at luggage?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,714.187,720.382,"Well, the... the Bostick test presupposes a reasonable, innocent person."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.128,738.419,But Drayton said nothing throughout the whole encounter.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,738.419,744.818,"Drayton's... Drayton's consent, as the district court found, was clear and unambiguous."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,779.658,810.661,"Well, it doesn't make it involuntary, but it... it does suggest perhaps that there is an ambiguity here as... as against your claim that there was none in Brown's consent because... and correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I... I think the first request to Brown was... or maybe to the two of them together... can I look at your... your luggage, your bag, whatever they had pointed to, and they said, sure."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,866.965,876.791,"You have the facts, but your conclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in... in the situation both individuals pointed to the bag."
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.37,918.402,"Well, you don't agree, I hope, with the... with the proposition that there would be no reason to decline the pat-down search except the reason that he had something incriminating on him."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,941.436,947.752,--The nature... the nature of the search is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry.
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.752,950.557,"Well, I think you're... I think you're missing my point."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,977.223,978.338,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,978.338,979.702,"And... and, of course, I would agree--"
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.702,981.104,"--You know, let's be reasonable here."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.104,982.014,Yes.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,985.025,986.223,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,993.736,1002.486,"The holding in Bostick, if I remember it, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in adopting a per se rule and left open the question of whether there was a seizure in that case."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1003.312,1004.427,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.377,1046.592,"Mr. Thompson, you--"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1046.592,1047.811,It has nothing to do with--
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1047.811,1048.638,--you were about to say--
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1048.638,1050.124,--compulsion.
2001.01-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1050.662,1053.385,--that the police... you were about to say when the police go over the line.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1077.533,1087.071,The... if... if the police would communicate to the citizen somehow that the citizen's response was compelled.
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.994,1116.254,"And that explains Miranda, of course, to the extent anything explains it."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1120.713,1121.539,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.539,1129.646,And the... the physical custody would have had that... that effect of... of causing the person to believe that he had no choice.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1129.646,1130.455,Absolutely.
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.692,1143.292,And you have a request and a response.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1151.427,1152.913,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.913,1158.114,"May I ask, Mr. Thompson, do you regard this primarily as a seizure case or a search case?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1158.114,1160.715,"This is a seizure case, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.364,1179.58,"Do you think it always would follow if you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was necessarily voluntary consent to the search?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1179.58,1183.582,If there was no seizure?
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.582,1184.159,Right.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1184.159,1199.558,"It... in this Court's test in Bostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the voluntariness in with the... in with the Bostick seizure analysis."
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.85,1206.329,It doesn't seem to me that analytically they have to be.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1225.398,1239.227,"It's... it's hard to... in the context of these bus... police-citizen encounters on a bus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the voluntariness test and the seizure test."
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.227,1244.678,But it does seem to me the passenger might have two different thoughts.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1258.358,1276.918,"I don't know, Your Honor, but I... I would posit here that we do not really need in this particular case to... to understand the full extent of the scope of the voluntariness test because the court below clearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure case."
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.918,1281.209,A seizure of the person or seizure of the contraband?
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1281.209,1283.893,"The person, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.893,1301.271,"If we were writing on a blank slate and other cases weren't there, what would be the Department's objections to a rule of law that said when you're on a bus, only 11 inches of an aisle, three people get on."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1334.808,1346.513,"Well, as this Court noted in Bostick, Your Honor, just because the police-citizen encounter happens on a bus, there's no reason to establish some kind of per se rule."
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.513,1351.426,"Well, I assume Congress could enact a statute like that, couldn't it, for Federal officers?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1363.315,1365.998,I... I don't know--
2001.01-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.998,1368.766,"You would have no problem with Congress doing that, would you?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1368.766,1373.634,"--I would... I would say, Your Honor, here that--"
2001.01-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.634,1374.339,It might.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1391.096,1393.119,--I can think of three reasons.
2001.01-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.212,1432.872,"And one of the difficulties with... with a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a bright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue about anything."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1445.709,1463.253,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and I would direct the Court's attention to a case that was cited in the Government's brief, United States v. Stephens, where there was some appropriate warning, and the court... the Ninth Circuit in that particular case said that the warning confused the passengers, intimidated the passengers."
2001.01-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.913,1473.739,"Well, I assume the other policy objection is, the underlying premise of Justice Breyer's suggestion is the Government has some obligation to teach everybody about their rights."
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1477.0,1478.281,--I would agree.
2001.01-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.281,1480.055,Especially when it's not required by the Constitution.
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1480.055,1480.798,"I would agree, Justice--"
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.798,1494.172,"May I ask you what significance, if any... I don't know if it's significant or not... do you attach to the fact that, as I understand it from the court of appeals opinion, that this officer had made similar requests several hundred times and only five or six people had ever said no?"
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1496.319,1498.426,"--It is not relevant, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.089,1508.579,You don't think that suggests that perhaps most people thought they had an obligation to answer?
2001.01-631,0,35181,larry_d_thompson,,1508.579,1521.006,"--Well, Your Honor, as this Court... as this Court held in Delgado, simply because most citizens cooperate and most citizens agree with the officer's request, that's no indication that the consent at issue is involuntary."
2001.01-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.836,1526.579,"Very well, Mr. Thompson."
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1528.519,1538.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its entirety."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1627.482,1650.416,"That... that I think is true, but could... if their point is that if... if you were to take your case, this case before us, and say under the present law and the test that you're enunciating, that you do have to tell the passengers what I suggested earlier... tell them they don't have to answer or respond... well, then you'd have to in every case."
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1655.7,1657.353,"--Yes, sir."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1664.905,1665.648,No.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1667.839,1669.075,"--Yes, sir."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1669.075,1671.759,And... and there... it's about buses.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1671.759,1672.147,"Yes, sir."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.147,1675.762,And the buses are stopped and somebody comes on.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1682.617,1683.038,"Yes, sir."
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.178,1730.83,Didn't they use language like that in this case?
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1735.827,1737.146,--They used--
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.146,1743.833,Didn't they make it clear that they were asking permission which suggests that the person has the ability to deny permission?
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1743.833,1747.383,"--Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I don't believe so."
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.909,1753.698,What... what words did they use in... in particular?
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1753.698,1757.58,They immediately approached each individual passenger--
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.58,1757.868,Right.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1757.868,1760.364,"--and said, I'm Officer so and so."
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.84,1762.409,Right.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1762.409,1764.822,Do you have a bag on the bus?
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.822,1765.381,Yes.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1765.381,1772.829,I believe that point right there denied the Bostick right to refuse to engage with the officer.
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.829,1773.35,Wait.
2001.01-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1776.733,1778.18,No.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1778.18,1779.416,No.
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.416,1779.871,"Surely, surely they required more."
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1779.871,1780.548,Then they asked another question.
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.548,1781.562,What was the other question that they asked?
2001.01-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.562,1784.413,On page 4 of the Government's brief--
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1784.413,1785.006,Do you mind--
2001.01-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.006,1786.104,"--it says, do you mind if I check it?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1786.104,1786.764,--Do you mind if I check it?
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.764,1794.732,"Does... does that not suggest exactly what you want them to suggest, that the person has the ability to withhold that consent?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1794.732,1796.673,"No, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.592,1813.224,"Well, what is the nuance of a question, do you mind if I inspect it?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1813.224,1820.2,"Because I think no matter how a reasonable, innocent person answers it, Mr. Chief Justice, the police can construe it as consent."
2001.01-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.943,1828.911,"But... well, is there any doubt that this person answered it in a way that indicated consent?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1828.911,1837.662,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there is doubt because I believe... not as to the bag, but as to the question, do you mind if I check your person."
2001.01-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.978,1845.258,"Well, what's... what's indirect?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1846.373,1851.491,"--Because no matter whether you answer it yes or no, it's not may I check your person."
2001.01-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.195,1862.198,"So, it... it turns on that sort of a subtle distinction?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1862.198,1863.547,"--I think it can, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.154,1866.602,"But if we do, then don't we have to follow the district court?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1874.692,1875.807,"--Yes, sir."
2001.01-631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.807,1877.747,And he heard the officer and he heard the tone of voice.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1880.469,1882.699,"Well, Justice Breyer, the district court applied the wrong test."
2001.01-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1904.535,1911.844,The freedom-to-leave test actually is... is more beneficial for your client.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1925.219,1932.278,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, from my perspective, the important point is that he applied the wrong test, the test this Court has rejected."
2001.01-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1934.34,1938.138,Do you want us to reverse because there was a test that's too favorable to your client?
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1938.593,1939.087,--No.
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.725,1980.78,Surely he meant their consent in those circumstances.
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1984.412,1985.238,"--No, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.238,1993.411,"Don't you think it's a little unfair to... to read that after... after he describes the whole situation as simply saying, well, since they consented, it must be okay?"
2001.01-631,1,26117,gwendolyn_spivey,,1993.411,1996.383,Justice Scalia--
2001.01-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.383,1998.408,"I mean, you can say, you know, I'm going to torture you if you don't let me look at it."
2001.01-631,2,35181,larry_d_thompson,,3338.561,3342.315,"Your Honor, I have a couple points."
2001.01-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.532,3415.959,Do passengers on the buses go through the same kind of check that we do on airlines?
2001.01-631,2,35181,larry_d_thompson,,3415.959,3417.816,"--No, they do not, Your Honor."
2001.01-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3417.816,3424.587,"That's... that's what I was wondering because today people might think if you're on a airport and you don't go through the detector, you don't fly."
2001.01-631,2,35181,larry_d_thompson,,3429.333,3430.902,We do not--
2001.01-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.902,3431.562,--on the bus.
2001.01-631,2,35181,larry_d_thompson,,3434.718,3445.104,"--We... we do not have that specific kind of program, and certainly that was not the... the reason relied upon for the consent in... in the record below."
2001.01-631,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3466.281,3468.221,"Thank you, Mr. Thompson."
