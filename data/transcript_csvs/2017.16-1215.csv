2017.16-1215,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.56,"We'll hear argument in Case 16-1215, Lamar, Archer & Cofrin versus Appling. Mr. Garre."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,7.56,35.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of debts procured by fraudulent statements, other than a statement respecting the debtor's financial condition. Everyone agrees that ""financial condition"" is a term of art used by Congress and in commercial practice to refer to one's overall financial status."
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.52,64.76,"Can you tell me, Mr. Garre, what is a statement respecting financial condition? In addition to a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement, what else would qualify?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,64.76,65.4,Sure.
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,204.4,210.44,"Could you tell me, Mr. -- Mr. Garre, what you think the difference is between ""relating to"" and ""about""?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,210.44,232.36,"I think, Your Honor, if -- if you go to the dictionary, the dictionary -- the definition that we provide for ""about"" means ""on the subject of."" It refers to the subject -- the subject here is financial condition. ""Relating to"" is a much broader term of breadth or at least can be used in that way. I mean, this Court famously -- as Justice Scalia famously said, everything is related to everything essentially."
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,232.36,232.48,Yeah --
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,232.48,233.44,"I mean, it's a term of great breadth."
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,233.44,245.24,"So there's something intuitive about what you just said, but then I started trying to come up with sentences in my head where I switched the two words, and I honestly couldn't find one where they meant something different."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,256.08,256.84,Okay.
2017.16-1215,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.84,347.8,"I'm -- Mr. Garre, the problem I have with your example is if I asked you tell me about your batting average and you said, I hit 5 out of 10 or I hit 6 out of 10, you would be answering that question, or you could say I hit 5 out of 10 when I was in a -- in a position to score a run. So the ""about"" would be answered in both ways."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,347.8,349.72,"Well, I think, first of all, are you referring to the subject --"
2017.16-1215,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.72,352.16,"The ""respecting"" would be answered in both ways."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,352.16,355.2,"Well, you're -- you're referring to the subject, the batting average there."
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,379.76,380.36,A problem.
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.24,401.52,"And, therefore, I suspect that the key of your example is the word -- the word ""something,"" not the word ""respecting."" And when you say ""tell me about,"" what usually that means is ""all about."" But let's try it with the word ""statement,"" which is in the statute."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,411.52,417.16,"Well, Your Honor, ""a statement respecting"" is still going to refer to about his batting average, the subject of it."
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,419.84,421.0,"No, not tell me. Make --"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,421.0,421.48,Make?
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,421.48,423.88,-- a statement about his batting average.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,423.88,424.2,Sure.
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,424.68,427.88,Make a statement respecting his batting average.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,432.2,443.36,"He hit the ball more than he struck out, versus he was -- that's a statement respecting batting average, versus he was robbed of a hit in the seventh inning by a great catch."
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.92,448.52,I'll take it -- I'll take it under consideration. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1215,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,448.52,466.32,"And what -- Mr. Garre, what -- what trouble -- what if the debtor makes a statement about a specific asset or a liability, but anybody -- but the reasonable listener would take that to be a statement about or respecting financial situation?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,466.32,477.44,"So our view, Justice Alito, is this Court should follow what Congress said and say that a statement about a single asset or a single liability is not a statement respecting financial condition."
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.96,517.96,I don't -- I don't follow that.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,559.84,560.36,Sure.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,673.52,707.16,"Mr. Garre, I'm not sure I understand how that helps you even on its own terms, assuming I'd be willing to look at it, of course. But if Congress's concern is that creditors are soliciting information that's incomplete about debts, liabilities, that's just half of the balance sheet that you want us to look at. So Congress appears to have been concerned, to the extent we can tell these things, about misstatements only with respect to one-half of overall financial condition. Right?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,707.16,711.44,"Well, I don't think that's completely correct, Your Honor, in the sense that --"
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,711.44,711.72,Good.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,711.96,721.6,"-- that the legislative record makes clear that the forms, the financial statements that creditors were using, were statements that referred to both liabilities and assets."
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,725.0,725.16,Right.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,730.56,741.64,"Congress -- the -- the creditors in that situation were using forms that represented one's overall financial status, referring to a credit score, net worth --"
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,741.64,757.52,"But doesn't that show that an omitted liability, one asset or lack -- or one debt, can reflect on the overall financial condition, that can be about and relevant to and reflect on the overall financial condition?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,757.52,759.32,It -- it certainly can be related to.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,762.08,764.48,"Well, Congress thought -- thought it could be about, didn't it?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,764.48,766.4,I don't -- I don't think it did.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,792.28,805.84,"But if you make a major representation about the absence of an overwhelming debt or the presence of an overwhelming asset, why can't that reflect on, be about, your overall financial condition?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,805.84,806.32,It's --
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,806.32,807.84,I own a genuine Vermeer.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,807.84,811.6,"I think, I mean, I'll give two answers to that."
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,816.96,817.12,Ever?
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,817.12,818.2,-- financial condition.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,818.2,818.48,Categorically?
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,818.48,818.84,Categorically.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,819.08,819.52,All right.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,820.36,820.8,"You know, people who win the lottery --"
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,820.8,821.72,Let's say I don't accept that.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,821.72,823.12,-- the lottery go broke too.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,823.12,823.2,Yeah.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,823.2,824.52,So that -- that's my first answer.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,824.52,825.68,What's your second answer?
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,825.68,839.92,"And my second answer is the one I gave to Justice Alito, which is that if one -- if the Court rejected the first answer, one could say that you'd look to whether a reasonable person in context would view the statement as being about one's overall financial situation."
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.92,841.96,"But it depends on context, doesn't it?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,841.96,842.44,It would --
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,842.44,846.68,"The bank says, Schmidt, you are broke."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,851.44,851.64,Right.
2017.16-1215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.64,856.08,"I mean, and, oh, oh, I didn't know that, says the teller."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,861.92,871.56,"And that would be a hypothetical that I think would call into play this -- this separate rule, if the Court wanted to go there. Now you couldn't say that about the statement in this case."
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,877.24,890.52,"Why isn't it exactly like the genuine Vermeer? All right? The law firm's chasing the client and -- and the client says: Okay, okay, okay, I'm late in paying, I know I'm terribly late in paying, but I have this tax refund coming."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,895.0,895.16,Yes.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,895.48,903.76,"Why isn't that -- why -- why isn't everyone in the room understanding exactly what that means, which is, okay, I don't have a lot else, but I've got this."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,903.76,911.04,"I think -- I think it's the difference between ""financial condition"" and ""ability to pay,"" which are two different concepts, and Congress said ""financial condition."""
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,911.04,919.56,"Well -- well, that -- that's a problem for me too, and maybe you can help me out with that, is the insolvency definitions in --- in the tax code, at least for municipalities --"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,919.56,920.28,Right.
2017.16-1215,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,920.28,927.2,"-- ""financial condition"" is defined as the ability to meet your current debts as they come due."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,927.2,929.56,That -- that's not the way Congress thought of it.
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.0,1083.32,May I -- may I ask you to clarify something? I -- I may not have understood this correctly.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1087.44,1087.92,Yeah.
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.92,1090.0,-- I think you said that would need to be in writing.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1090.0,1091.88,It would.
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.96,1120.68,"How is -- how is that significantly different from ""don't worry, I have an anticipated tax refund that will enable me to pay your bill""?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1120.68,1121.32,Right.
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1129.88,1130.44,"Well, but Mr. --"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1130.44,1131.64,Collateral is not a --
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1131.64,1132.32,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1132.32,1142.6,"I was going to say, I mean, you -- it's not uncommon for people to have -- be in dire financial straits but yet go to get loans on the basis of collateral. That's sort of the pay day situation that the government refers to."
2017.16-1215,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1158.28,1163.92,"But which says more about your financial condition, Mr. Garre? ""I'm above water."" That's one option."
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1167.48,1171.52,"Well, I -- I think the ""I'm above water"" tells you about your financial condition."
2017.16-1215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1358.16,1366.12,"Why wouldn't the result be to get people, especially law firms, to do -- do things in writing?"
2017.16-1215,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1366.12,1376.4,"Well, and that -- and that's an argument that -- that's a reason that the -- the Eleventh Circuit gave, and that is advanced by the Respondent here, not so much so by the government."
2017.16-1215,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.28,1535.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes."
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1535.88,1556.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's principal textual argument is to say, instead of looking to ""relating to,"" they prefer the word ""about."" Now we reject the premise that there's any substantial legal difference between those two concepts."
2017.16-1215,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1629.6,1632.52,"Well, let's -- let's take Mr. Garre's example of the Harvard Business School graduate."
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1649.12,1650.76,"So a few things about that, Your Honor."
2017.16-1215,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1662.08,1662.4,Okay.
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1682.52,1687.08,"Well, yes, Your Honor. And what would deal with that example is the materiality requirement."
2017.16-1215,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1689.8,1697.36,"Well, no, no, it was reasonably relied on for the purpose of the loan or the services rendered or whatever, as collateral, surely, of course, it was."
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1701.72,1704.2,"Well, the question would be the reliance theory there, Your Honor."
2017.16-1215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.56,1858.44,Your -- your -- your understanding shrinks what would once fit under (2)(A).
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1865.76,1877.12,"So, Your Honor, a substantial amount remains under (2)(A), as 34 years of Fourth Circuit practice have shown, and that's because most of the claims -- most plaintiffs under Section 523(a)(2) are not lenders."
2017.16-1215,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1936.64,1943.4,"In saying that, are you saying that (2)(A) does not really exist anymore with respect to fraud on lenders?"
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1943.4,1951.12,"No, it still can exist for fraud with lenders, particularly when somebody is making a statement at the time of obtaining debt as to a future promise."
2017.16-1215,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.16,2097.56,And they -- they all read the Bankruptcy Commission report?
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2097.56,2099.76,"Well, it was -- it was entered in -- into the record, Your Honor."
2017.16-1215,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.76,2103.32,"It was entered into the record? Oh, then I'm sure they all read it. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2103.32,2107.4,"Your Honor, though, to be clear, our principal argument rests on the text of the statute."
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.28,2165.04,May I go back to the argument Mr. Garre -- Garre did? He said the Congress was seeking to -- to protect debtors where credit companies were telling them to omit a particular item.
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2165.04,2166.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2166.76,2168.64,How does this rule protect those creditors?
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2168.64,2169.32,How --
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2169.32,2186.4,"Because, if the debtor provides the balance sheet in writing but omits something that the creditor asks -- tells them it's not -- it's unimportant, why does the writing requirement save the debtor? It doesn't really."
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2186.4,2187.88,"Well, Your Honor, that's because --"
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2187.88,2189.56,It doesn't save the debtor because --
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2189.56,2193.28,"Your Honor, in (2)(B), there were two particular protections."
2017.16-1215,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.72,2240.08,Would you respond to -- to Mr. Garre's argument that the statement here concerns ability to pay and not financial condition?
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2240.08,2256.52,"Well, it's hard for me to see the distinction between those two, Your Honor, because I think people are concerned about ability-to-pay statements because they go to financial condition, and vice versa, financial condition statements are -- are relevant to condition -- to ability to pay. But, again, as the government says, ability to pay is a very important part of this test."
2017.16-1215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2339.64,2363.64,What about the argument that you would be putting a burden on small businesses that deal informally? You would be putting a recordkeeping requirement on them for a statement like: I've got this tax refund.
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2363.64,2387.48,"Well, so, Your Honor, this rule has applied for 34 years in the Fourth Circuit, and neither Petitioner nor its amici have come up with a shred of evidence that there has been any untoward policy effect on small business or any other sector of the economy. And I think we know exactly why, because the NFIB amicus brief cites its own report, and its report, at page 8, concludes that bankruptcies are not significant problems for small business."
2017.16-1215,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.44,2436.56,"Well, you know, we -- we get these arguments a lot."
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2459.32,2469.28,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the -- the point that we make is a -- is a more limited one, which is to say if the sky were falling in the Fourth Circuit, there would be some evidence or some outcry from these very substantial jurisdictions."
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2570.36,2576.16,Could -- could you tell me how you think -- why you think your rule is better than the Solicitor General's suggestion?
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2576.16,2578.2,"Well, our rule is -- is superior for several reasons."
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2585.44,2587.72,So how is your rule different from the Solicitor General's?
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2587.72,2588.12,"Oh, sorry."
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.16,2609.44,All right.
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2614.04,2614.24,Sure.
2017.16-1215,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2614.32,2617.16,"I know they spoke about context and purpose, and you didn't. So --"
2017.16-1215,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2617.16,2617.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1215,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.4,2693.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sandberg."
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2693.4,2703.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our view and Respondent's view of the statute leaves the no-discharge rule in fraud cases basically intact."
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2854.96,2868.92,"You say that a statement respecting the debtor's financial condition ""encompasses an affirmative representation about a single asset if that representation is offered as evidence of the debtor's ability to pay,"" right? So it's --"
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2868.92,2869.56,That's right.
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2869.56,2876.72,"That goes -- it is the intent of the person making the statement, the subjective intent of the person making the statement?"
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2876.72,2882.64,"No, we see it as an objective test -- test that turns on the context in which the statement is made."
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2889.88,2890.08,Right.
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2890.08,2900.76,"-- for oral statements really. So, if the -- if the creditor says: Tell me about your financial condition and the debtor says: Here are the three significant assets I own that you should know about, one of them is a genuine Vermeer --"
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2900.76,2919.0,"So, if the debtor makes the statement not intending it to be evidence of -- to be taken as evidence of the debtor's ability to pay, but it is taken in that way by the creditor, that counts or a reasonable creditor would take it that way?"
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2919.0,2923.6,I think a reasonable creditor gets closest to the -- the right approach.
2017.16-1215,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2945.64,2946.08,But Mr. --
2017.16-1215,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2946.08,2947.92,"Your -- your test -- I'm sorry, please."
2017.16-1215,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2947.92,2958.96,Mr. Hughes said that there was really no practical difference between your test with the evidence of ability-to-pay language in it and his test without it. Do you disagree with that or agree with that?
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,2958.96,2988.12,"As I understand Respondent's position, there -- there is no practical difference in how it turns out. We're really -- the point of our ability-to-pay language is -- is to get at what we think Congress was trying to do here. And one can agree or disagree as a general matter with its policy choice, but what we think Congress was trying to do was treat statements that go to a debtor's ability to pay differently than -- than other types. So a statement respecting financial condition is -- is one made for the purpose of shedding light on one's financial condition. And -- and why ever would a creditor care about that? Because they want to know if they're going to get their money back."
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2988.12,2989.16,What if it's a false --
2017.16-1215,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2989.16,2989.96,Following up on -- sorry.
2017.16-1215,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2989.96,3003.4,"What if it's a false statement about an asset, but it isn't one that would be taken by a -- a reasonable creditor as having any significant bearing on financial condition?"
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,3003.4,3009.72,"Well, I think that that statement probably would not be material or it would not be one that the creditor would have reasonably relied upon."
2017.16-1215,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3038.2,3061.52,So why do we have to look at the debtor's intent? Why don't we just -- won't the elements of reasonable reliance capture almost -- how can -- how can a creditor reasonably rely on a statement that wasn't -- that couldn't have been intended as --
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,3061.52,3065.08,I think that's right. I don't think we are looking to the debtor's intent under our approach.
2017.16-1215,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3077.12,3081.8,"We've been focusing on the balance sheet, and that's where your focus has been."
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,3101.04,3107.08,I think our approach would cover those statements because we think that they are financial representation -- representations that go to ability to pay.
2017.16-1215,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3126.0,3128.0,"Well, but you talked about assets or liabilities."
2017.16-1215,2,62973,jeffrey_e_sandberg,,3132.68,3133.84,That's right.
2017.16-1215,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3208.4,3213.2,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Garre."
2017.16-1215,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3213.2,3233.96,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The rule advanced by Respondent and the government would essentially wipe out the application of 523's baseline rule in the consumer finance or simple collateral situation. The government says itself on page 18 of its brief that statements respecting debtors' finances are, of course, common in credit transactions."
