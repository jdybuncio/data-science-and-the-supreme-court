1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,18.475,41.59,"The question presented in this case, if the Court please, is whether the Board has power to declare a union out of compliance upon a finding in a separate administrative proceeding that an officer of the union has filed false non-Communist affidavits and that the union membership was aware of their falsity."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,201.545,207.705,What was the -- what was decided not to be -- be about it?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,207.705,210.613,"The record indicates about 100,000."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,210.613,212.314,"100,000."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,219.909,220.621,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,225.84,231.535,"And that meant a 100,000 or does it mean something else?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,231.535,234.299,"General knowledge is what the record in this case would suggest, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,234.299,248.444,"Well, I -- I'm not questioning how the knowledge was brought forth, whether it's the objective to the -- the issue to be ascertained whether the 100,000, whatever the -- whatever the basis, whatever the evidence has included."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,258.279,261.516,"That was one of the issues, whether there was general knowledge by the membership."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,261.516,262.571,By the -- by the whole membership?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,262.571,265.205,"By the membership, precisely."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,283.33,284.785,Was he an officer at that time?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,284.785,285.653,He was.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,285.653,288.194,(Inaudible) --
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,288.194,289.764,The hearing officer issued --
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,289.764,292.815,Isn't that the time of the hearing on the falsity?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,292.815,293.263,"Yes, at that time."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,293.263,294.251,(Inaudible)
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,294.251,294.777,Yes.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,294.777,297.041,All right.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,297.041,326.623,"The hearing officer found that among other things, the August 1949, Travis' statement is closed on its face that is contemporaneous non-Communist affidavit filed with the Board was false and found further that the membership of the union was aware of the falsity of Travis' 1949 affidavit and of subsequent affidavits, but nonetheless, continued to reelect him to office as secretary-treasurer of the union."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,326.623,333.163,Is the validity -- is the correctness of that finding on either showing here?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,333.163,334.217,"I think not, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,335.965,337.813,"That's conceded, is it?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,337.813,339.71,It was not reached by the court below.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,351.311,354.571,Stating a word by the (Voice Overlap) --
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,354.571,354.871,Because the court --
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,354.871,356.994,Provided to be otherwise if you cut that --
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,356.994,363.808,"Our view is, Mr. Justice Frankfurter that it's not here because the court below did not reach it."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,367.476,369.079,It wouldn't come to that issue.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,377.78,378.402,Yes.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,378.402,379.016,(Inaudible)
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,379.016,382.605,"Yes, sir."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,382.605,386.947,So that the remanded question doesn't have to be trespassed if you don't believe --
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,386.947,388.68,"That is -- that is our view, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,423.502,429.045,"I didn't mean to affect the course of your argument, I just want to know what it is I have to listen in my mind."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,429.045,431.759,Precisely.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,650.228,656.882,"Simply, six of the circuit judges charged him in its view of what the Court of Appeals had."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,664.786,666.268,"That is right, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,670.941,680.776,I don't mean as a (Voice Overlap) in the head of the judges.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,680.776,708.538,"The Court's position of course implies that the Board function with reference to non-Communist affidavits is purely a ministerial one, that it has no right or authority to look behind the paper to inquire into truth or falsity, that it must accept affidavits even though they concededly be false as counsel Harwood suggested in the prior argument."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,934.691,942.407,"Thereupon, is (Inaudible) connection to this or both?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,942.407,945.217,"Both, I would say, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,986.329,987.398,"Mr. Kammholz, before you get to that --"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,987.398,988.025,Yes.
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,988.025,1000.024,-- on -- on that first position that the Board took that determined that the question of a falsity of the host was a matter for the Department of Justice.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1006.956,1008.235,"No, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.255,1025.846,"The other way around, is there any manifestation of the -- the call for insanity for that question?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1034.065,1037.603,"That's -- that's an intriguing inquiry, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1044.185,1069.808,"Well, Mr. Kammholz, the reason I ask is because at that particular time about all the Board would have to go on would be the legislative history and I wondered what interpretation it put upon the statements of Senator Taft at the time the Conference Report was filed, these that we've been -- that we've been talking about."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1069.808,1091.996,"The early -- the early interpretation of the Chairman of the Board and -- of the Chairman of the Board was as contended -- as is contended by the respondent here, that the Board was not obligated or empowered to engage in administrative, the determination of truth or falsity."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1091.996,1100.295,"Did they base that upon the legislative history, particularly the attitude of Senator Taft?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1100.295,1103.025,"They did in part, they did in part."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1120.499,1121.627,Relied on the opinion on that?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1121.627,1122.491,-- rely upon it.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1125.611,1127.668,Can you give me reference to that?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1130.287,1147.164,"That is referred to, Your Honor, in the Lannom brief, the footnote at page 13."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1147.164,1148.113,The other --
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1148.113,1150.443,"In the other brief, in number 40, yes, Lannom."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1150.443,1151.968,I beg your pardon?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1151.968,1153.695,Page 13.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1153.695,1154.791,Your brief?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1154.791,1159.299,"Our brief, yes."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1159.299,1177.39,"Well, I can see Mr. Kammholz, how the Board would learn from experience as to what its function probably should be depending upon the ramifications of -- of such situations."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1197.161,1202.397,"I suppose there are two factors that were significant in that regard, Mr. Justice Warren."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1216.035,1219.889,"Experience wouldn't hardly change the legislative history, would it?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1219.889,1233.063,It might well have a marked impact on what the people on the Board thought that history had intended -- was intended to be.
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1233.063,1239.138,"In other words, the legislative history would change from time to time to fit the facts that they saw."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1239.138,1239.93,"No, not all."
1956.57,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1286.573,1290.249,Were there new members of the Board who made the change?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1297.764,1300.052,I think the cumulative experience with this --
1956.57,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1300.052,1302.4,I'm -- I'm talking about the members of the Board
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1302.4,1304.576,I -- I wouldn't undertake to answer that.
1956.57,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1304.576,1308.021,What wasn't change in the first bill?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1308.021,1314.239,It's been a continuing change and I -- I can't delineate it for you precisely at this time.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1314.239,1323.261,Do I get the impression that -- that an overlapping member said he was Chairman Herzog.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1335.499,1338.317,"And then testified the other way, yes."
1956.57,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1354.455,1360.813,"When the change occurred, was it unanimous?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1360.813,1362.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1374.203,1375.439,Would you help me out?
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1379.972,1382.197,"Well, Your Honor, he was there long before I."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1384.976,1385.975,He's been there a long time.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1386.116,1388.158,He's been there a long time.
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1388.158,1392.573,"So that he was -- was he one of these people who changed position, Senator Murdock?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1392.573,1393.637,"Yes, yes."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1393.637,1395.857,And he was almost -- I didn't know he was quite to the Senate.
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1398.733,1400.426,"Well, he was in the Senate until three."
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1400.691,1410.173,The Senate was -- he may have been in the Senate when the statute was passed and that changed -- then read his own history back and then forwards.
1956.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1410.173,1411.002,"Mr. Kammholz, would you --"
1956.57,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1411.002,1415.345,"(Voice Overlap) power to that, we do it all the time.[Laughter]"
1956.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1415.345,1436.274,"Mr. Kammholz, did I understand you to say that there is no evidence of any kind, even slight evidence to indicate that the Board stated (Inaudible) originally either because it felt it had no power or as a matter of what seemed then to be administratively desirable."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1436.274,1441.15,"The problem was not posed in the early days, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1956.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.15,1447.377,"Well, the fact is that the Board that didn't move in on this field at all would said justice ought to do."
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1448.592,1449.762,That's precisely what happened.
1956.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1449.762,1459.915,"Now -- but there is no evidence that that was done either because they thought they had no power or administered a way even if they had the power or not, a desirable thing to do?"
1956.57,0,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,1459.915,1463.885,"There were suggestions as I recall it, they thought they didn't have the power."
1956.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1580.775,1597.181,Mr. Witt.
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,1597.181,1600.058,May it please the Court.
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.835,2063.681,What do you say Congress did?
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2063.681,2064.152,In --
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2064.152,2065.61,What else do you say Congress did?
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2065.61,2066.931,"In 1954, it passed that --"
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2066.931,2069.081,"No, when they took away the bill?"
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2069.081,2069.938,"No, sir."
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2069.938,2071.571,I thought you said that --
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2071.571,2072.547,I'm sorry if I --
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2072.547,2073.092,What -- what --
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2073.092,2074.81,"-- perhaps, I mistook -- misspoke myself."
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2074.81,2076.88,What is the consequence with Congress --
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2076.88,2077.231,The pass --
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.231,2078.283,-- in 1954?
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2078.283,2090.181,"Well, by passing the Communist Control Act in 1954 if there was any slight doubt before that, Mr. Justice Black, whether the Board had this power."
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.35,2126.251,But I don't see what -- that you would say if you are saying that the passage of that Act refutes the argument he's made here as to the power the Board has.
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2126.251,2150.726,"Well, the argument that the Board makes basically here and it's more fully developed in its brief is taking this particular case, is not merely that Travis continued to be a Communist or whatever you want to call him because there's an ambiguity about that."
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2172.884,2187.194,"I understood one of his arguments to be that the Board had a right to preserve its processes from perjurious affidavits, and I don't see why the passage of the Communist Control Act answers that argument in here."
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2187.194,2217.957,"No, it doesn't in that sense, Mr. Justice Black, but in arguing that an interpretation should be put on the legislative history of the 1947 Act, the Board argues that this history of continued Communist influence or control or domination, supports the -- the power that the Board is asserting as a result of the 1947 Act."
1956.57,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2255.128,2274.503,"What do you say about Chairman Herzog's testimony quoted in the Government's brief, on page 13 of his brief and 40, down at the bottom of the page 13?"
1956.57,1,37330,nathan_witt,,2274.503,2303.003,"Well, without now arguing number 40, Your Honor, that quote from Chairman Herzog has a reference to a conviction, conviction of an affiant, the way union officer would file an affidavit, and that's not our case at all."
1956.57,2,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,3250.739,3253.595,"Very briefly, I should like to make two observations."
1956.57,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3292.125,3299.052,"Mr. Kammholz, Mr. Herzog as such (Inaudible) in this field has -- I looked at his testimony."
1956.57,2,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,3414.864,3416.421,"We shall be delighted to do that, Your Honor."
1956.57,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3416.421,3425.2,It looks -- I don't quite (Inaudible)
1956.57,2,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,3425.2,3427.021,There is this other consideration.
1956.57,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3447.69,3450.195,"Mr. Kammholz, may I ask just this one question?"
1956.57,2,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,3469.681,3470.972,That is not our position.
1956.57,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3478.302,3485.839,"In other words, that if you have the power, you may decomply merely upon being satisfied that the affidavit was in fact false?"
1956.57,2,42497,theophil_ckammholz,,3485.839,3487.232,That is our position.
