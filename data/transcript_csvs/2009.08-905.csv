2009.08-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.135,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-905, Merck and Company v. Reynolds."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,6.07,22.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute of limitations for private securities fraud claims incorporates the equitable principle known as the discovery rule; that is, the principle that the limitations period begins to run from the discovery of the facts constituting the violation."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,38.375,66.775,"Counselor, that presumes that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts constituting a violation and a different statute, like section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when it says ""due diligence""."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,66.775,75.298,"--Well, Congress did say that, Justice Sotomayor, in section 77m, section 13 of the 1933 Act, but we don't think--"
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.298,78.666,So are we supposed to presume that they like using unnecessary words?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,78.666,89.372,"--Well, we don't think that Congress's inclusion of that express language referring to constructive discovery in that provision was significant, and that's because of the default understanding--"
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,89.372,90.788,"So you're answering me yes, it's unnecessary."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,90.788,92.907,--We don't think it makes any difference in terms of the application of the rule.
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.694,128.145,But you want to go beyond constructive discovery?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,128.145,130.061,"Well, no, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.648,145.154,"Well, I think there's a line between constructive discovery -- constructive discovery asks, when should you have known?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,148.689,158.728,"--Well, we are asking the Court to adopt the principle of inquiry notice, but we don't believe that that is a particularly significant additional step."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.773,182.676,"Under your rule, what happens when you are put on inquiry notice?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,188.913,190.647,"That's right, and at least where--"
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.647,196.401,"And that's where the -- statute begins to run, at the point when you should have conducted additional investigation?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,196.401,199.519,--At least where a plaintiff fails to conduct an investigation--
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.519,200.003,--Yes.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,200.003,200.619,--as is the case here--
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.619,201.053,Okay.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,201.053,201.386,--the limitations period--
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.386,201.736,All right.
2009.08-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.736,210.409,What would you -- what would you -- what phrase would you use to describe what happens when inquiry notice culminates in finding out?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,221.265,249.534,"--Well, I think it's true that at that point the plaintiff discovers the remaining fact, and so to the extent that the Court embraces our fallback approach, under which a plaintiff who actually exercises reasonable diligence and conducts an investigation gets the benefit of additional time, one can essentially embrace and codify that understanding of the words of the statute, which is to say a plaintiff at the point of inquiry notice suspects the possibility that the plaintiff has a claim."
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.942,264.794,But how could--
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,264.794,267.329,--at that point the plaintiff will have discovered the underlying facts.
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.329,272.631,--How -- how could that -- let's descend from the abstract to the concrete that is this case.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,316.991,317.391,Right.
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.701,357.717,"Well, excuse me."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,358.152,358.835,--before the plaintiffs filed.
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.835,372.043,"--To say that, you must believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy, without--"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,372.043,372.459,"Well, there was more than that."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.459,374.909,--without any evidence of scienter.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,376.928,387.303,"Well, most notably, you had the FDA specifically accusing Merck of deliberate wrongdoing in connection with its public representations concerning the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.303,395.658,"Well, but deliberate wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to the other side of it."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,395.658,398.61,"Well, but the FDA did more than that in the warning letter."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.066,408.732,That means it's -- that means it's wrong.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,413.784,421.04,--But I do think that the fair reading of the FDA warning letter is that the FDA was accusing Merck of intentional misrepresentation.
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.04,422.34,But it didn't stop it.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,448.691,454.143,"Well, it is true that Merck continued to maintain its belief in the naproxen hypothesis."
2009.08-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.332,494.665,But one of the things they could not have done was file a lawsuit right then.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,504.14,516.03,"--Well, we don't believe that the Respondents would have had sufficient information to file a complaint then; and, indeed, we have taken the position that they still don't have sufficient facts to satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements."
2009.08-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.088,530.054,"Well, but if we had that--"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,530.054,531.04,--that somehow provided them additional information.
2009.08-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.04,537.61,"--If we had that kind of analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve all of its defenses, then we would never get to the statute of limitations problem."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,546.3,546.966,Right.
2009.08-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.966,550.918,"Well, I -- I think you don't get -- get very far."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,577.319,578.604,"Well, it may very well--"
2009.08-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.604,581.473,"Even on -- on -- but you have you to say, on their theory of the case."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,581.473,586.941,--It may very well be that the plaintiffs have to possess at least some information bearing on scienter.
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.152,604.719,Can you tell me--
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,604.719,605.354,--information relating to scienter.
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,605.354,609.556,--Can you tell me what that investigation would entail?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,643.463,646.848,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, that there are at least a couple of other things they could have done."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.208,674.313,"Assuming they had talked to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that those lawyers had more information than the ones they included in the publicly available lawsuit?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,674.313,680.383,"--Well, there's no way to know, of course, because the plaintiffs in this case failed to conduct an investigation at all."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,681.3,682.252,You haven't answered my question.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,697.012,712.771,--I would say that the very fact that other lawsuits were filed that accused Merck of making intentional misrepresentations with regard to the very same statements that are at issue here actually itself constitutes additional information that should have put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice in the first place--
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.771,737.303,"How when -- when there were -- doctors across the country were continuing to write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another -- but there were not signals from the market itself, and the medical profession seemed to be going on and writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions for this?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,737.303,741.088,"--Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, the market did respond."
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.957,746.29,Very brief.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,746.29,746.557,--inquiry notice analysis.
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.557,751.527,"There was a brief drop, but it came right back up again."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,751.527,764.752,"A brief drop in response to the FDA warning letter, a substantial drop, but the stock price did rebound; and a longer term drop over the course of 2001 when the various other events that are discussed in the briefs were occurring."
2009.08-905,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,766.037,774.374,"Your arguing that if the -- if the plaintiffs' attorneys made diligent investigation, they would have uncovered facts about the safety of Vioxx that the FDA was unaware of?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,774.374,775.342,--Well--
2009.08-905,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,775.342,779.594,"Because the FDA never took any action during this period, other than changing the label."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,779.594,788.534,"--Well, the FDA did issue the warning letter, and the label was changed to incorporate language indicating the cardiovascular disparity from the VIGOR study."
2009.08-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.625,845.72,"But the -- I take it the point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is I take it you will concede the following: Let's imagine on January 1 some investors look out and there are not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots to put them on notice."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,889.196,890.08,"--Well, that's correct, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.08,890.43,All right.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,932.373,939.86,"I think there's no doubt, Justice Breyer, that the easiest rule in some sense for the Court to apply would be a rule that started the clock running from the date of inquiry notice."
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.138,975.133,"Why not say that because of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that there's no inquiry notice based on -- there may have been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or deliberate, we have no way of knowing."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,995.113,1010.373,"--Well, again, Justice Ginsburg, the fundamental inquiry, so to speak, in determining whether a plaintiff is on inquiry notice is simply whether a reasonable investor based on the information in the public domain would at least suspect the possibility that the defendant has engaged in securities fraud."
2009.08-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.764,1023.883,But it's inquiry -- it's notice of what?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1035.94,1038.29,"--Well -- well, that's correct."
2009.08-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1050.514,1054.316,"Well, but if not, then the whole storm warning theory that you have conceded doesn't work."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1054.316,1060.119,"--Well, I -- I'm by no means conceding that the storm warning theory doesn't work."
2009.08-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.558,1073.61,Then he would have to file a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to even bring a case.
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1086.603,1095.293,"--Well, there are certainly going to be cases, Justice Breyer, in which a plaintiff frankly can never get to the point where the plaintiff can satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements."
2009.08-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.326,1098.678,"In those cases, of course, the statute would not run."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1099.745,1100.779,--No.
2009.08-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.812,1114.254,"If we go back to the text of the statute, it says 2 years after discovery, and you argue it should mean 2 years after he should have discovered, though -- and that period being measured by a date from inquiry notice, which is not mentioned in the statute at all."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1114.254,1124.312,"--Well, I think that in understanding the term ""discovery"", Justice Stevens -- that term really can't be meaningfully understood without reference to the common law against which the statute was enacted."
2009.08-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.264,1131.216,But you do agree that you are reading as though it meant 2 years after he should have discovered?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1131.216,1136.203,"--Well, that's right, and, again, I think that getting to the point of ""should have discovered"" is a fairly modest step."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.649,1169.924,"Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we -- we had to choose between what statute of limitations provision, Federal one, we thought applied."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1227.796,1228.713,"--Well, no, I don't--"
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.713,1238.418,"I mean, I read this -- this statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1251.245,1260.867,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the Court did choose to essentially incorporate the language from -- it was section 9(e) of the 1934 Act."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.088,1272.492,"Well, just tell me what the difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1272.492,1272.725,--Well--
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.725,1283.281,"What was the difference, unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) -- absolutely required knowledge?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1283.281,1290.701,"--Well, I think one potential difference is that section 13, section 77m, refers to discovery of the untrue statement or the omission."
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.794,1307.527,So there was no difference between the two--
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1307.527,1307.944,"--No, there was really--"
2009.08-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.944,1308.694,--and we were just wasting our time?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1308.694,1322.935,"--There was no difference between the two, and I think really for the reasons that the government states in its brief as well as the reasons that we state in our opening brief, the default understanding has always been that a reference to discovery includes at least constructive discovery."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.107,1335.159,Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1364.864,1366.097,"--Well, I think--"
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1366.097,1370.416,It would require the shareholder to find the guy in Burma?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1391.162,1405.737,"--I think it's an open question, Justice Sotomayor, as to what actual discovery would -- would actually mean, and I think that there would be a pretty good argument that you don't actually discover the underlying facts until the plaintiff himself subjectively actually has them in his possession."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1405.737,1408.239,"Well, that's going further than the amici are suggesting."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1416.643,1417.428,Well--
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1417.428,1425.765,"What, in addition, do you think constructive knowledge would include that the actual knowledge standard doesn't?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1425.765,1435.556,"--Well, I think it does -- constructive knowledge obviously also includes information in the public domain, and we believe that the plaintiffs in this case were on inquiry notice precisely because--"
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1435.556,1436.389,Putting all of that--
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1436.389,1436.739,--of that information.
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1436.739,1439.674,"--what in addition to that would it include, in your mind?"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1439.674,1443.56,"Well, for purposes of the inquiry notice analysis, I think that that's all you look to."
2009.08-905,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.547,1456.451,So -- so you are conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual knowledge standard is the same as a constructive knowledge standard?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1456.451,1473.162,"--Well, I would hope at a minimum that if the Court were to embrace an actual discovery standard, it would look to information in the public domain, precisely because otherwise you really would be rewarding an ostrich plaintiff because a plaintiff who claimed not to read what was in the newspapers could have the benefit of additional time."
2009.08-905,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1473.562,1480.482,"Well, if actual knowledge means things that the plaintiff doesn't actually know, then I don't know what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge."
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1484.97,1489.672,"--Well, again, that's not how I would ordinarily understand the phrase ""actual knowledge""."
2009.08-905,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1509.336,1510.336,"Well, what is the problem--"
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1510.336,1510.719,No circuit--
2009.08-905,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1510.719,1522.743,--What is wrong with the -- with the inquiry notice rule that the court of appeals in this case set out on pages 29a to 30a of the joint appendix?
2009.08-905,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1563.634,1566.503,"--I think I'll answer that question, and then I would like to reserve the balance of my time."
2009.08-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1589.649,1590.551,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1597.188,1607.311,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that Congress intended the word 1658 to have its normal and well-established meaning."
2009.08-905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.041,1629.993,"Well, you're adding -- you're adding concepts to it, as well."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1643.382,1650.054,"Well, we say, at the first part of our submission, that the Court can decide the case on an actual discovery -- actual knowledge standard."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1670.051,1674.336,Can -- can you tell me what you see as the difference between the two?
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1698.869,1705.439,"--In a fraud-on-the-market case, like this one, where an efficient market is pleaded, there's no practical difference."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1744.896,1752.566,"But I -- it sounds right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical example--"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1752.566,1753.083,--Sure.
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1753.083,1761.322,"--of what you are talking about, where -- where an individual investor would have something that's not in the public domain."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1761.322,1776.332,"That would be information that the -- the broker, for instance, would have made available to the investor, that the investor simply didn't look at, or that the investor could have asked for, but -- but never followed up in obtaining."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1798.411,1809.386,Well -- but actual knowledge would include anything the investor had in their possession because that's what actual knowledge is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the public domain.
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1810.469,1810.969,Correct.
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1810.969,1819.492,The -- the only difference then would be information the individual would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in the public domain?
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1819.492,1832.399,"That's correct, through reasonable inquiry, that by following up with questions to the broker or to other persons associated with that entity."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1838.988,1844.123,"I -- so we are in agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might have a different -- they would be identical?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1844.123,1844.706,"--That's correct, and--"
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1844.706,1852.296,"You are suggesting that, in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be constructive knowledge because there could be things that--"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1852.296,1871.107,"--It could be actual or constructive, depending on the facts and circumstances, but the important point to draw away from this is that Congress also wrote in a 5-year period of repose in this statute and followed up on the suggestion of the Lampf dissenters, who believed that the period of repose was too restrictive."
2009.08-905,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1899.427,1902.145,But when does the -- when does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the 5-year period?
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1902.145,1903.612,--From the violation.
2009.08-905,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.612,1905.513,"Well, what is the violation?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1905.513,1909.148,The violation would be a material misstatement made with scienter.
2009.08-905,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.735,1953.161,But you -- you say that you did -- you did begin this action even before that point was reached because you -- you attribute this to the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall Street Journal article?
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1962.7,1963.569,That's correct.
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1973.675,1981.764,"--So you are admitting that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you filed?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1981.764,1982.181,No.
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.814,1990.801,"So, if you had a good faith basis, what was -- what was in your possession that gave you that good faith basis?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1990.801,1995.455,"--First, let me say that the first complaint is now a legal nullity."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.172,2005.16,"Counsel, I -- whether it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which is: You had to have a basis for your complaint."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2010.297,2028.093,"--Shortly before the filing of the first complaint, there were public releases of a study that was done by the Harvard Brigham and Women's study, and that was a large epidemiological study that was the first empirical basis that disproved an aspect of the naproxen hypothesis."
2009.08-905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.102,2043.419,"That doesn't prove scienter, though."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2043.419,2060.845,"Well, to an investor who was following this information, that very well may have led to a strong inference of scienter because of the vociferous denials that Merck subsequently made to a study that was publicly reported as being funded by a Merck grant."
2009.08-905,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.296,2092.333,"But Judge Sloviter used the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2101.272,2103.474,--That's correct.
2009.08-905,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2174.717,2189.91,"Now, your -- your position is that the statute begins to run at the time when a -- a plaintiff is -- has constructive knowledge, at least, of information that would be sufficient to file a complaint that would satisfy the PLRA?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2189.91,2190.56,That's correct.
2009.08-905,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2214.006,2218.474,"Well, my question -- why, then, did Congress allow 2 years after that?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2224.711,2248.743,"In the legislative reports that accompany the Act in 2002, what the Senate described in its report was a concern that a 1-year period would be too short for a plaintiff to file an action, survive a motion to dismiss, and then gain discovery about the possibility of other codefendants who had participated in that fraud."
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.186,2322.041,"So, is there a difference -- I'm trying to get these terminological differences clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the difference between you and the government."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2373.369,2373.836,I don't believe so.
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.303,2377.255,"--Is there no difference, then, between the two of you, or what?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2377.255,2385.592,"--Well, the difference -- here is the difference: We accept that the pleading standard rule advocated by the government is the brightest line rule and that this Court should adopt it."
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.203,2402.703,Okay.
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2436.274,2437.79,That's correct.
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.79,2438.79,So you both agree about that?
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2438.79,2439.94,We do agree on that.
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.831,2460.085,"So -- so you want to say, you ought to get enough information from that or in all the other things the same, so that you have -- are able to file the complaint."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2466.188,2466.504,No.
2009.08-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.427,2476.677,"No, I'm not saying -- I'm not so worried about that."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2480.562,2501.994,"--The difference -- the space between our the position and the government is really quite small, and it rests on pre-1934 interpretations of ""discovery of the facts constituting"" that did not seem to tie specifically to pleading standards, but nonetheless adopted a reasonable person standard based on what a reasonable person would have believed that fraud had occurred."
2009.08-905,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2501.994,2513.033,"Mr. Frederick, before you -- you've finished, there's something puzzling about the Third Circuit decision, and it's that Judge Sloviter says at the end, in summary,"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2558.912,2561.947,"Well, this was brought as a motion to dismiss, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-905,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.774,2624.54,"Well, it does seem to me that even if we adopt your theory of the case, there is some problem with the allegation that there was fraud, because Vioxx did not -- because Merck did not disclose that the hypothesis was only hypothetical, and the FDA August letter made that clear."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2627.575,2628.308,--I don't think so--
2009.08-905,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.308,2630.61,"But, again, I'm not sure we would parse that out up here."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2630.61,2635.228,"--Well, you can in these ways, because the market had no reaction."
2009.08-905,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.001,2645.453,"Oh, well, you mean we have to look to see how the analysts react?"
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2645.453,2652.857,"--Well, that was part of the factual inquiry that Merck itself submitted as part of its motion to dismiss."
2009.08-905,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2679.607,2685.928,"Well, you think there was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 2003."
2009.08-905,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2685.928,2693.267,"To be sure, subsequently information came to light that brought Merck's very serious fraud to public attention."
2009.08-905,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2722.167,2723.069,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2737.379,2750.869,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its terms, section 1658(b)(1) provides that the 2-year period of limitations will commence to run upon discovery of the facts constituting the violation."
2009.08-905,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2794.631,2804.487,Was there also a substantial support in the lower court case law prior to the enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry notice?
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2807.123,2811.093,There were certainly frequent references to the concept of inquiry notice.
2009.08-905,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2855.004,2863.86,"But, under your position, as -- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially very unimportant, if not completely meaningless."
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2876.5,2884.17,"--Well, I think it is -- I think you are right that that is the ultimate question for the Court: When would a reasonably diligent person have obtained actual knowledge?"
2009.08-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.507,2941.443,So how -- how -- what's the right phrasing?
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2967.074,2968.526,"--Yes, we -- under our--"
2009.08-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2968.526,2969.609,How do I say that here?
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2969.609,2982.684,"--Under our standard, the -- the individual would have knowledge of facts constituting the violation once he had facts sufficient that if -- if alleged in a complaint, they would survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim."
2009.08-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.684,2983.017,Okay.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2983.017,2983.817,They would establish--
2009.08-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.817,2985.636,So you are basically in agreement.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3001.479,3003.43,--That's correct.
2009.08-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.863,3007.665,"And if it happened to be a case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't."
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3010.598,3011.367,--That's correct.
2009.08-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.117,3013.902,I don't understand -- I don't understand that.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3026.643,3027.16,--Yes.
2009.08-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.16,3029.511,So inquiry notice has nothing to do with anything.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3029.511,3043.171,"Well, inquiry notice is -- in many instances, identifying the point of inquiry notice is often essential to identifying the point at which a reasonable person would have discovered the facts that would support a well-pleaded complaint."
2009.08-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3043.171,3043.837,I don't understand that.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3043.837,3058.764,"For instance, suppose it was common ground that there were records available in an admittedly obscure public records office, and that a plaintiff, once he started to conduct an investigation, would find those records within a week."
2009.08-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.992,3090.818,"Well, and maybe -- and maybe it turns out that you could find them within a week and maybe it turns out you could find them within 3 months or when the fellow from Burma is released, but in either case, it's when they discover it or should have discovered it."
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3090.818,3106.494,"--That's correct, but we -- again, knowing only that the records would have taken a week to be discovered once the plaintiff started looking, wouldn't tell you when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have found those records, unless you also knew the date on which the reasonably diligent plaintiff would have begun his investigation."
2009.08-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.494,3108.927,"Mr. Stewart, you are talking about a hypothetical case here, right?"
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3108.927,3109.446,Yes.
2009.08-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.446,3112.398,Some -- we are talking about this particular case.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3121.42,3126.788,"I think typically in a fraud -- on-the-market case, inquiry notice will really tell us nothing meaningful--"
2009.08-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3126.788,3127.121,Right.
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3127.121,3131.24,--because the whole premise of the case is the market as a whole was defrauded.
2009.08-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.542,3136.81,"So, in this particular case, we should ignore inquiry notice entirely?"
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3136.81,3144.666,--I think we should ask: When would a reasonably diligent investor have discovered sufficient facts to file a well-pleaded complaint?
2009.08-905,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3165.745,3166.379,Why does the--
2009.08-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3166.379,3192.229,"And, Mr. Stewart, the -- you said -- the phrase that you used were (1) facts constituting an alleged violation -- which you say is the test -- and (2) facts evidencing scienter."
2009.08-905,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3192.229,3200.15,"And I think if you read Tellabs as a construction of this statute, it would be inconsistent with our view."
2009.08-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.128,3351.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-905,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3354.032,3356.5,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-905,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3511.147,3515.282,"As long as the stock price was holding, how was the plaintiff injured?"
2009.08-905,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3515.282,3529.773,"--The plaintiff may not have suffered an injury by that point, but it is clear that section 1658(b) refers to the facts constituting a violation of section 10(b), not all of the elements of a private cause of action."
2009.08-905,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3559.458,3568.397,"If it's true that everything was locked up internally at Merck, all the reasonable diligence in the world would not have uncovered what eventually came out."
2009.08-905,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3568.397,3578.586,"--And under our approach, if a plaintiff comes forward and shows that the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence but was unable to discover any remaining information, the plaintiff will have the benefit of additional time."
