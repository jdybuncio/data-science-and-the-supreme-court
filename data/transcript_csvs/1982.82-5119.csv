1982.82-5119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.026,The next case is Bell v. United States.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,32.518,35.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.931,89.868,"Mr. Allman, Daytona wasn't the drawee of the check either, was it?"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,89.868,92.024,"--No, Dade Federal Savings and Loan."
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.048,107.781,The check wasn't drawn on Dade Federal Savings and Loan?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,107.781,108.249,"No, it was not."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.499,464.341,You agree you must resort to legislative history to win your case?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,464.341,473.134,"--Yes, I do, Judge, and I think in the Ninth Circuit Le Master analyzed the legislative histories of 2113(b) even though Turley was a--"
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.134,475.79,What is the ambiguity in the statute?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,478.738,480.067,"--Steal and purloin, yes, sir."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.067,495.514,--Because there was a carrying away of money with some kind of an intent to... At least the person knew he was not entitled to the money.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,495.514,497.795,"There is no question about that, Judge."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.979,510.787,But Jerome at least used words that had some common law meaning like larceny--
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,510.787,511.287,Larceny--
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.287,515.475,"--and things like that, but steal or purloin does not have that kind of meaning."
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,515.475,516.333,--It is a generic term.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.48,631.567,Are there any other statutes that would make it a crime to get money from a bank other than by this violent kind of crime?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,631.567,633.1,"Yes, there are, Judge."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.411,640.47,"I mean any other federal law, any federal law."
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,640.47,643.375,"--Yes, as a matter of fact, a recent case, Williams."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.706,683.813,I will put it another way.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,701.303,703.147,--There are other statutes both state and federal.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.693,704.492,I mean federal.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,704.492,705.693,--Okay.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.693,709.878,Or does this come as close as any?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,709.878,712.361,I believe this comes about as close as any.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.786,762.435,"Well, do some of the cases on either side of this issue... Do some of them relate to say giving a bank false information in an application for a loan and getting money from--"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,762.435,763.998,That is Williams.
1982.82-5119,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.966,775.385,"--Well, couldn't this defendant perhaps have been charged under that section 1014?"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,775.385,777.569,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.454,793.612,"Well, he certainly got money by means of false statements here."
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,793.612,797.469,"Well, in reality he took advantage of the bank's mistake."
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.601,831.188,Have the liabilities been settled as between the Dade Federal Savings and whatever bank the check was drawn upon in this case?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,831.188,842.684,"I am not certain about that, but I am certain that Dade Federal guaranteed his endorsement and, therefore, they ultimately would have paid for their mistake, I'm sure."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.306,859.397,In 1014 Congress has protected the bank against false statements in loan applications?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,859.397,860.146,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.146,868.549,"So it really has not left to the states in all circumstances the false pretenses crimes, all of them?"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,868.549,870.374,"I would agree with that 100 percent, yes, sir."
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.374,880.919,"Well, here is just another arguably did not leave the false pretenses kind of crime involved in this case."
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,880.919,891.416,I would have no problem with that in resolving the ambiguity in saying stolen or purloined if the legislative history had not specifically eliminated the crime of false pretenses.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.164,933.757,What would he have been charged with under state law?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,935.333,936.068,Larceny.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.895,938.143,I know but how about--
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,938.143,939.067,Forgery.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.067,941.879,"--He forged somebody's name, did he not?"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,941.879,947.143,In reality forgery is given very broad definition in Florida.
1982.82-5119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.623,950.735,"Well, he purported to be the payee, did he not?"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,950.735,951.297,--Yes.
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.141,987.468,Is there not an aspect of the legislative history that you have not addressed at least yet?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1019.284,1028.28,"You could argue that, Judge, but when Congress has done something specifically and not later taken corrective action as they have done in other cases--"
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.28,1030.078,They did take out the words
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1033.904,1038.244,--The bill which was not enacted into law--
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.244,1038.712,Correct.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1045.322,1046.102,--That is correct.
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.261,1080.823,"If they wanted just to cover that situation, should they not have said takes and carries away without the consent of the bank because in that situation there would have been no consent--"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1080.823,1081.774,--That is correct.
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.774,1083.369,--the one that they are talking about specifically.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1085.101,1087.133,"Takes and carries away, steals, or purloins."
1982.82-5119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.768,1098.862,You are suggesting the statute should be read as if it included the words
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1100.438,1110.092,If we are going to separate the part... False pretenses gets us to the fact that they tricked him.
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.702,1146.638,"Well, Mr. Allman--"
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1146.638,1147.122,"Yes, sir?"
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1147.122,1153.291,--wasn't common law an element of I think they call it aspertation in larceny.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1159.885,1162.837,This is the way I feel and this is what I think Congress was concerned with.
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.282,1185.715,Certainly it does not have to be robbery.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1186.904,1204.944,"Burglary or larceny, but the quick, violent active type of crime that Congress was addressing in this matter, if you look at legislative history and if you look at the interpretation in Turley, Turley says how are we going to interpret the words ""steal and purloin""?"
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.253,1251.161,When you say a violent I take it--
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1251.161,1252.3,I mean active.
1982.82-5119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.3,1257.389,--burglary could certainly obtain at 3:00 in the morning and no guards around.
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1260.138,1263.372,"Nonconsensual, active taking away, yes, sir."
1982.82-5119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1267.2,1274.242,Why is this less a removal than taking it a 3:00 in the morning when they happen to leave the door open?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1274.242,1275.584,It is both a removal.
1982.82-5119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1278.929,1281.819,He carries it away in both cases does he not?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1281.819,1282.49,--I'm sorry?
1982.82-5119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1282.49,1284.284,He carries it away in both cases?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1284.284,1285.052,Yes.
1982.82-5119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1426.557,1434.942,Am I correct that if you win your man goes free and that the statute is wrong in the state case?
1982.82-5119,0,38593,roy_w_allman,,1435.834,1436.333,"No, sir."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1503.648,1505.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.087,1581.505,"Mr. Giuliani, did he take cash?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1581.505,1583.475,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe he did."
1982.82-5119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1608.794,1614.635,Was there any other federal statute which conceivably could have covered his action here?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1614.635,1615.836,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1615.836,1616.944,Not 1014?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1616.944,1624.49,Ten fourteen would not because this would under your own decision in 1014 this would not have amounted to an extension of credit.
1982.82-5119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1624.49,1625.863,The Court's decision.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1625.863,1627.348,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.032,1713.953,Is the same true that that would have been a violation of state law?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1713.953,1715.079,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.079,1717.138,"That would be a violation of state law, I assume?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1717.138,1718.016,I assume it would be.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.016,1724.074,"Just in a broader sense, what is the reason why these cases ought to be in the federal court rather than the state court?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1724.074,1726.102,"Well, Your Honor, the banks--"
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.102,1732.666,"I understand it is a federal insurance at a bank, but nevertheless it is a state crime as well."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1738.601,1746.018,"--Well, first of all there is potential federal lability in the sense of all of these banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--"
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.018,1746.564,I understand.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1746.564,1748.97,--and it is our view that this is precisely--
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1748.97,1751.812,I am not too sure that the statute does not limit it to those.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1759.027,1760.841,"--No, Your Honor, it would have to be either a--"
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.841,1762.513,Are all banks insured?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1762.513,1765.087,"--I do not believe all banks are insured, Your Honor, it would have to be--"
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1765.087,1767.524,"Well, the statute says all banks."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1769.649,1770.631,"--Well, it should be--"
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.631,1778.036,"Or any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association, so it applies to all banks."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1778.036,1778.801,--Now it does.
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.218,1791.81,But the statute we are operating under says all banks.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1791.81,1792.921,It has been expanded since then.
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.935,1794.938,It says all banks.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1795.967,1797.059,That is correct.
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.059,1800.057,I join Justice Stevens.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1817.519,1822.316,"First of all, Your Honor, this particular bank was not an uninsured bank."
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.87,1844.399,Is it not true that it was passed in response to a specific problem.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1852.159,1856.831,"No, Your Honor, that is what caused the 1934 Act to pass."
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.831,1860.126,"Right, and then they picked it up to take care of the fellow who walks in and finds the money on the counter."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1860.126,1865.545,But I think there is a very big difference between the 1934 Act and the 1937 Act.
1982.82-5119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.491,1887.442,I suppose one explanation on the policy issue is that that is the way Congress decided it should be.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1890.675,1895.814,"But, Your Honor, I do not believe that that gives effect to what the 1937 Congress did."
1982.82-5119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.814,1904.452,"No, my point is only with respect to the policy question that was suggested that why does the federal government get into it."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1907.449,1909.056,That is precisely correct.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.056,1910.995,Why didn't you read the statute correctly?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1914.43,1927.989,"Well, our argument is simply that the plain language of the statute if you put aside distinctions that are 200 and 300 years old and have been criticized for 200 or 300 years as just introducing technicalities into the law that have no equity."
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.695,1959.665,Not just burglaries but robberies.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,1959.665,1961.74,Only robberies in 1934.
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.089,2040.068,"Mr. Giuliani, what if Mr. Bell instead of being an outsider here had been a teller in the Dade Federal Savings and Loan Association and had simply embezzled $10,000?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2040.068,2049.423,That would be covered by a separate statute that had a federal embezzlement statute that applies to agents and employees of the bank.
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.5,2060.716,Would you say it was covered also by this statute?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2060.716,2064.854,It could be covered by this statute as well.
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.854,2069.244,Does that mean you think it might be but you are not sure?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2069.244,2077.207,"No, I believe that the purpose of the Congress in 1937 was to broadly prohibit theft from a federal bank."
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.63,2101.966,"So the taking away requirement is really almost done away with because in the facts of this case you have Bell actually taking $10,000 that did not belong to him, dollar bills, so to speak, or tens or hundreds, but in the embezzlement thing it is just basically a credit or a ledger transaction."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2103.183,2103.791,No.
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.164,2113.258,But I am not trying to strike a bargain.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2116.46,2126.033,"The statute should be interpreted to reach theft offenses, larceny, larceny by trick, and taking by false pretenses."
1982.82-5119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.033,2127.141,How about embezzlement?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2127.141,2131.251,It does not have to be read and should not be read to reach embezzlement.
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.218,2137.342,Do you think embezzlement is a taking away?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2140.887,2143.324,"Yes, Your Honor, there clearly is."
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.324,2148.132,"If there was an embezzlement, why would the statute not cover it?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2148.132,2148.962,Well--
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.962,2161.877,"We have other instances where an act we have already recognized it that, I think it is in the bank field, where the same act violates two different criminal statutes."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2161.877,2165.251,--You could interpret... The statutes could cover the same ground.
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.908,2170.078,What about the false application on a loan application?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2174.153,2175.327,That is covered in 1014.
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.327,2180.934,Was that on the books in '37?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2180.934,2184.667,"I do not know if it was or not, if it was on the books in '37 or not, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2472.828,2490.337,"Mr. Giuliani, speaking of the Jerome case, in Jerome the Court held the burglary prohibition of section 2113(a) did not cover this act and the underlying act in Jerome was, I think, uttering a forged check."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2497.243,2501.646,"No, Your Honor, because actually it was an incomplete crime."
1982.82-5119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2512.159,2514.39,That is contrary to your position.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2514.39,2516.374,--That is contrary to the position that the government is now arguing.
1982.82-5119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2570.948,2578.583,"If the act had been completed in the Jerome situation, could the government have prosecuted under subsection (b)?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2578.583,2579.959,"--Yes, I believe so."
1982.82-5119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.568,2595.593,Could the government in the case that we had last term in Williams have prosecuted for the check kiting scheme under this subsection?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2595.593,2612.087,If the scheme had actually been completed in the sense that check kiting you have the ambiguity as to whether or not the person intends to make good on the check in the period of time between the time that they write the check and the time that the check is actually finally negotiated.
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.748,2716.809,Let's get back to the other question that you made.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2733.191,2752.295,"Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, the line would be with this particular bank a bank whose actual funds were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation so that I--"
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.295,2755.168,You mean the state law would not cover that?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2755.168,2756.322,"--No, state law does cover it."
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.402,2764.508,Mine is what line says that this is a state crime and this is a federal crime?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2764.508,2773.566,"--In this particular case it would be the federal insurance in federally insured banks, the necessary and proper clause of the constitution."
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2773.566,2775.411,You say it was two crimes.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2780.219,2781.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.267,2793.481,Is there any procedure in the Department of Justice that says who should prosecute an instance of double crime when it is a crime against two sovereigns?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2793.481,2808.335,There is a formal procedure that exists if a person is prosecuted in one place and then there is the possibility of prosecuting him again because of the possible double jeopardy concerns involved in that.
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.0,2831.482,There is nothing in the record to show why this was brought in the federal rather than the state court?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2831.482,2832.776,--In most--
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.776,2835.089,"No, sir, in this one."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2836.446,2837.745,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.968,2859.406,And there is no burden on the federal department?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2859.406,2861.422,"Yes, there is, Your Honor, but--"
1982.82-5119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.422,2862.046,I thought so.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2862.046,2862.982,--there is a sharing.
1982.82-5119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.542,2922.224,"If this savings and loan association had not been federally insured, could there have been a prosecution under this statute?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2922.224,2943.713,"I do not... The statute was expanded in 1950, Your Honor, to cover additional institutions, and it is not limited just to institutions insured by the FDIC."
1982.82-5119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2951.664,2959.334,"Not all banks but some savings and loans institutions, I think, are purely state institutions--"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2959.334,2959.974,That is correct.
1982.82-5119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2959.974,2962.52,--without any federal insurance.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2970.831,2982.482,"I think that is further defined, Your Honor, to include only banks that are federal reserve banks, federally charted banks or banks that are insured by the federal government in some way."
1982.82-5119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2984.9,2987.914,--Any bank in this statute has been so limited?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2987.914,2990.445,"--I think it has been, yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.445,2991.993,How has it been limited?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,2999.363,3020.951,"Yes, further on in the statute, Your Honor, 2113(f) as used in this section the term bank means any member bank, federal reserve system and any bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank or other banking institution organized or operating under the laws of the United States and any bank the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC."
1982.82-5119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.181,3030.758,"Well, if that were not the case, why it would apply to any bank and it would not make any difference how this case came out."
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3035.772,3036.942,That is correct.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.516,3089.703,May I interrupt right on that point?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3110.928,3112.164,--I believe he was.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.206,3125.376,That is why it would seem to me... I wonder if he thought it was as expansive as the government's argument would make.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3129.954,3141.574,"Well, I actually do not think you have to say that in '37 you need an expansive interpretation of the language of either the statute or the legislative history, just a common sense interpretation of it."
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.77,3158.143,And more broadly than '34?
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3158.143,3159.219,--That is right.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.219,3165.923,"The only example that was given, and am I correct, and it is the only example that was given was the larceny example?"
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3165.923,3173.325,It was an example that would have constituted if you use the common law distinctions of common law larceny.
1982.82-5119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.288,3189.834,Right.
1982.82-5119,1,39383,rudolph_w_giuliani,,3189.834,3201.877,But in '34 or '37 there is absolutely no concern at all evidenced as to whether it should be common law larceny or larceny by false pretenses.
1982.82-5119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3277.456,3278.689,Very well.
1982.82-5119,2,38593,roy_w_allman,,3280.611,3288.793,May it please the Court.
1982.82-5119,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.081,3390.845,Thank you gentlemen.
