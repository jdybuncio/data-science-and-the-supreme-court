1959.339,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.217,"Number 339, New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company, Petitioner versus Scanlon, District Director of Internal Revenue, et al."
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,14.32,18.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.898,407.1,"May I ask Mr. Hart, as of what date in reference to the filing of the federal tax lien did the surety as you put it, definitely (Inaudible) of the contract?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,407.1,413.514,The surety came in I think after the filing of the tax lien.
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.208,467.208,"Well, if the -- if that time of the filing of the federal tax liens that you had not yet stepped in use of a contract, to whom did the city at the time of the filing of tax liens owed them?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,467.208,468.998,"Well, if there are no money would be loaned."
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.02,516.809,"Well, did (Inaudible) also arise after the filing of the tax liens?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,516.809,518.953,"In this case, I believe it did."
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,556.726,567.656,"Well, then you mean this case comes to us, virtually you and the Government and the other side in agreement that the property did belong to the surety at the time that --"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,567.656,578.981,"Yes, well, the -- the surety thing subrogated for the position of the owner and its right of subrogation depending on whether it has in fact expanded the money."
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.512,606.061,"Well, is there right such issue here?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,606.061,607.683,"No, sir."
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.617,636.255,And this even on the premise that in fact that the contractor's business -- no property of the contractor but only the surety code.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,636.255,636.914,Yes.
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.914,641.346,Even on that premise the -- should you civilly suit by rather than summary suit?
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,641.346,646.581,There are plenary suits but nobody says against whom and there isn't any findings (Voice overlap) yes.
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.581,647.997,That's what the contention is?
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,647.997,649.075,Yes sir.
1959.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.075,653.539,"Although it's your money, you can't resort and no claim belongs to the contractor."
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,659.749,682.378,"Well, I must say with respect to that that the respondent has not been required to take a position in the posture of this case as to whether it concedes, he concedes or denies that the money belong to the surety because he had attacked the jurisdiction of the Court and has not been required to respond to the factual allegations of the petitioner."
1959.339,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.378,692.824,"Isn't that really the point that the questions, the issues that the subjects of Mr. Justice Brennan's questions have not yet been reached, is it, and then you don't know if there any -- if there --"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,692.824,695.277,"It's actually so, Mr. Justice Stewart, yes."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1013.111,1019.1,"May I ask you, on what basis you assert that the Court had custody of this property?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1019.1,1024.392,On the basis of the express language that of Section 2463.
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1024.392,1030.239,I read it to say that the property should be in the custody of the law.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1030.239,1038.089,The several cases which have dealt with this have made no distinction between the custody of the law and the custody of the courts --
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1038.089,1038.243,Now --
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1038.243,1043.122,"-- by taking it – I am sorry, sir."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1107.839,1121.305,You're seeking an adjudication that you're not a taxpayer and that the funds here being held are your funds and it was being held to the tax debt to somebody else improperly.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1121.305,1121.8,"Yes, sir."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1121.8,1137.704,"Now then, how do you buy writing a letter to the Court or file a motion with the Court initiate proceedings that result in the Court's acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1137.704,1145.563,The Court does not get jurisdiction over the person of the defendant by our filing a petition.
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1208.719,1226.811,"What do -- tell me, do the Federal Rules allow the initiation of a proceeding against a defendant and the requirement of his return and answer otherwise and upon 20 days allowed for the rules?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1226.811,1228.122,"No, sir."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1243.946,1267.735,"Now, if there were jurisdictions over some raised or some already pending case in the Court, then any notice in the form -- reasonable notice to some other person in an ancillary or a dependent proceeding would that Court in due process would be sufficient to bring that person in, wouldn't it?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1267.735,1268.334,"Yes, sir."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1268.334,1270.495,That's what is in this case?
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1270.495,1272.232,"No, sir."
1959.339,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1272.232,1273.133,I don't understand.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1273.133,1293.742,"Well, if I may take your very illustration, suppose that Mr. Scanlon the District Director in this case having seized our property then resigned, and was no longer the District Director, who would be the defendant in our suit."
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1638.51,1646.082,"I -- I understand that you derive your power here from the implications of 2463, is that right?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1646.082,1647.427,"Yes, sir."
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1647.427,1664.659,And I wonder if you would make a comment on the discussion of the problem of summary recovery of that property that is involved here of the opinion in the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller?
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1666.505,1667.023,"Well, I --"
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1667.023,1670.358,In the discussion of Justice Brandeis in that case?
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1688.243,1695.521,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I would say that we are submitting to this Court that the history of 2463 --"
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1695.521,1699.134,(Inaudible) explicitly that will require to that --
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1699.134,1701.078,Expressed language.
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1701.078,1702.731,-- or having in purpose.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1702.731,1709.965,We'll -- we'll put together leave no alternatives in logic to what we are here submit.
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1738.666,1741.685,He might claim it ex officio.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1741.685,1746.471,"Well, if he claims it as ex officio, if I -- if I get the solution --"
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1746.471,1753.159,"But I mean, he might claim that's not stolen or the Court pleaded that he might say this is a (Inaudible)."
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1753.159,1754.583,Exactly so.
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1754.583,1757.337,(Inaudible) state keepers as well.
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1757.337,1758.795,"Yes, we're not personally."
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1766.813,1778.156,"I know the difficulty of substitution -- substitutive party that if he resigns, he is fit to be getting to an action of where he got to resigning their offices."
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1778.156,1786.421,"Well, the District Director has a pretty powerful weapon in being able to proceed administratively to seize property."
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1805.199,1808.582,"But those are contested questions, aren't they, Mr. Hart?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1808.582,1808.788,"Oh, yes."
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1808.788,1819.064,"What happens that maybe they clear, you maybe -- he may be extra zealous or he maybe extra careful or he – you say we'll find it out in the -- some legal action?"
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1819.064,1829.546,"They -- they may will be sir contested questions and power before us is if they are contested which we assume they are, how are you trying to manage?"
1959.339,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1829.546,1843.669,"Well, I -- the reason I put the case to you is because the characteristic detail in the -- Mr. Justice Brandeis in that opinion for the Court said this if the impression that you want a good deal before we will allow such an action."
1959.339,0,30824,jack_hart,,1845.806,1849.352,"No, sir and I would agree with that and I say we have a good deal present."
1959.339,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1856.206,1857.73,Mr. Roberts.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1857.73,1861.172,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2213.997,2226.369,"Mr. Roberts, before you proceed with the replevin thought, would you indicate what was embraced, what was accomplished by subject only to the order to decrees of the Courts in dealing with the 1833 statute."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2236.436,2237.834,I beg your pardon Mr. Justice?
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2237.834,2266.858,"I just want to know, to what -- for what purposes that authorization if it maybe so called was put in subject only to the orders and decrees of the Courts of the Unites States shall be accepted, shall be deemed to be on the custody and subject only to the order of the -- dedication arise under the -- before we get to the modern form of the progentive statute."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2275.957,2282.065,I believe that it would have reference to the case where prior to this time.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2282.065,2282.931,By the what?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2282.931,2286.042,Prior to the time of the enacting of this Section.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2286.042,2286.813,1833?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2286.813,2288.495,In 1833.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2317.424,2317.767,Do you mean that --
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2317.767,2320.098,Collector of the custodies.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2320.098,2328.91,On your -- on your suppositions you in that a prior judgment which is a matter of committee ought to be respected by the federal courts.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2339.219,2339.386,No.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2348.177,2359.644,"I know it couldn't but -- I understand that, but it could go to the U.S.C., United States Court and ask that Court to release the property within its custody, is that it?"
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2359.644,2363.137,I don't understand that the -- that should go to the state court to the federal court.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2363.137,2364.683,I'm thinking enlightenment.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2403.941,2404.179,Yes.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2404.179,2410.948,"And there's an authorization, it shall be subject to orderly decree of the Courts of the United States."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2420.276,2425.651,"Well, it would be recited this would give, this district court jurisdiction over this property."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2425.651,2426.548,To do what?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2426.548,2432.536,"To order a return to the petitioner, if it's rightfully his Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2432.536,2435.665,"Well, I thought that would be that, only asking."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2435.665,2436.856,"Now, that's what he is asking."
1959.339,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2436.856,2437.294,You've been saying --
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2437.294,2439.1,But we say we should --
1959.339,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2439.1,2440.395,You were set on a plenary suit.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2440.395,2441.434,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2441.434,2444.118,Isn't that all that's involved here?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2444.118,2445.084,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2445.084,2447.984,But it doesn't say anything about plenary or summary.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2447.984,2449.938,"No, it does not."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2455.773,2461.289,"Well, but the authorization to surrender isn't qualified by anything in the language."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2469.554,2471.382,I'm not sure that I understand your question.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2471.382,2474.484,"Well, I'm afraid I can't make it clear."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2500.074,2501.612,I don't think it's in the statute.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2501.612,2503.315,Where do you get it from?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2503.315,2505.361,"From Rules of Civil Procedure, Your Honor, that authorizing --"
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2505.361,2507.628,But that didn't say anything about it.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2526.295,2528.957,I don't believe it is property in the custody of the Court.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2533.824,2535.129,In custody of the law?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2535.129,2537.926,"Yes, but not in custody of the Court, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2540.226,2543.873,"Do you mean if -- if it could be claimed on, that (Inaudible), that --"
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2543.873,2545.68,"No, I do not mean that, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2586.906,2597.863,"Well then your answer means that if the -- if property were in the custody of the Court and that restricted and technical and intelligible sense, then the Court couldn't make summary disposition."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2597.863,2600.443,"If it's in the custody of the Court, yes, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2600.443,2612.244,"Now it probably is in the hands of the custody in bankruptcy, in the custody of law and custody of the Court."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2612.244,2615.17,"Leave us in the custody of the Court, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2615.17,2620.094,But is there a specific provision dealing with summary dispositions.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2620.094,2623.355,"Yes, but he must -- but he must go to the Court and get approval to self."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2623.355,2624.769,"Yes, he must get all that."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2632.129,2633.077,By the Bankruptcy Act --
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2633.077,2634.833,By the Bankruptcy Act.
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2638.618,2642.833,"I'm afraid I cannot answer that, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2647.542,2656.258,"Now, before going -- when the 19 -- from 1833 down to whatever it was 1930, there was no federal procedure, Rules of Federal Procedure, was it?"
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2656.258,2656.995,That is correct.
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2656.995,2658.57,"Now, what was the situation?"
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2672.361,2673.269,"No, Your Honor."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2673.269,2673.626,There is no --
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2673.626,2687.824,"This case is -- the Raffaele case in the Third Circuit that uses this section of the code as giving the Court jurisdiction, in giving it custody in the Court subject to the summary orders of the Court."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2694.377,2699.488,"In other words, the Third Circuit read it as unqualified."
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2707.237,2708.745,"Yes, sir."
1959.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2742.701,2743.571,Campbell what?
1959.339,1,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2743.571,2750.249,"Campbell and Usry, U-S-R-Y, there are two District Directors."
