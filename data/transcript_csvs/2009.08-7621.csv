2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-7621, Sullivan v. Florida."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,7.487,22.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Joe Sullivan was 13 years of age when he was arrested with two older boys, one 15 and one 17, charged with sexual assault, ultimately convicted, and sentenced to life without parole."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,33.387,39.791,"Mr. Stevenson, there's a serious question before we get to the particulars of this case."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,64.656,67.274,"Yes, there are two responses."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.33,85.086,"They said there's a question whether that means an illegal sentence, like the judge gave more than the maximum punishment."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,94.859,103.715,"--Yes, we cite in our brief Summers v. State, which is an example of someone challenging their sentence after this Court's decision in Apprendi long after the time would have run."
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.715,110.201,"Except the court there applied 39(a) and said: Yes, it's a change in law, but it hasn't been made retroactive."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,110.201,110.968,That -- that's correct.
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,118.372,120.574,But isn't that what the court said here?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,134.817,136.186,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.773,146.458,"No, that's an unfair characterization."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,163.753,165.469,But our argument -- and I accept that.
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.32,194.938,"But Roper was decided under a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is different."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,199.759,206.93,"Well, because -- because what the Court said in Roper categorically for the first time is that kids are different, and in this context we were arguing--"
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.93,210.484,"It said kids are different for purposes of the death penalty, which is different."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,210.484,214.936,"--Well, I think our argument was that they are different for the purposes of sentencing."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.949,240.384,Let me -- let me--
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,240.384,242.253,--had their sentences reduced to life in prison with parole.
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.253,254.144,"--But this judge said: Yes, there's a Federal question in this case: Does Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for juveniles?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,282.477,296.136,"Well, because under your precedent, if the question -- if the judgment of procedural default is dependent on an analysis, an assessment of Federal law, in any context, then it is not an independent and adequate State ground, and that's the basis on which we--"
2009.08-7621,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.136,303.79,"Well, suppose arguendo we assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not establish a rule that applies in this case."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,311.896,318.466,"--Yes, that is the rule would still allow us to challenge the sentence under the notime restriction as it relates to the sentence--"
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.466,319.0,"No, no."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,337.879,345.883,"--Well, yes, but if you agree with the State court about Roper did, then we don't -- we are not entitled to relief under -- under either theory, under a merits theory or a default theory, but the point is--"
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.883,347.568,"Oh, I don't -- I don't know about that."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,361.076,361.661,--No.
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.417,400.702,I thought -- I thought Simmons got life without parole.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,402.988,404.721,"--Simmons did, Your Honor, in Missouri."
2009.08-7621,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,432.055,446.665,"Your argument is that because the -- the State judge had to decide whether Roper dictated or required the result that you were asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State ground."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,447.683,455.754,--My argument is that if Roper applied -- if Roper is relevant -- because what the State courts of Florida have said is that when you are looking at this question there are three things.
2009.08-7621,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,470.146,473.715,"No, but I'm -- I'm interested in how we decide whether it's independent."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,489.641,491.308,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.449,561.07,"Well, that's true, but once we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the result in this case and, therefore, there is no exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes an exception where the fundamental constitutional right asserted was not established within the period provided for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish it, you're out of court, it seems to me."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,565.272,566.622,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.663,581.115,Then that would completely overtake the specific provision.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,596.208,597.243,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-7621,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.392,631.731,"And you say the -- under Florida law, the question is not whether the right was, to use the phrase, ""clearly established""?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,631.731,632.364,--That's correct.
2009.08-7621,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.364,634.683,But the right is whether or not -- it had -- what was your phrase?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,635.799,636.266,That's right.
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.535,668.185,Can I--
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.185,683.913,"Did -- did you raise below your assertion that the exception -- that there is an exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences, that there is -- that that is an exception to the normal rule of 2 years' limitation?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,685.23,691.417,"No, because at no point did the State make any argument that we were barred or precluded in any way."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.969,757.978,"Why won't the next case we get be an argument that for a juvenile, particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years is too long; 40 years doesn't recognize his capacity for moral development within a reasonable period?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,757.978,762.513,"--Mr. Chief Justice, you may get that case and this Court will have to evaluate that."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,783.344,788.064,"No, but -- I mean, you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence, right?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,792.968,793.551,Yes.
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.551,795.451,--that this type of sentence is unconstitutional.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,795.451,804.174,"I think with regard to very young kids, I -- I don't think we can say that the States have adopted or considered or approached this kind of sentence, in part because--"
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.174,816.334,"All you have established is that there is a consensus that that sentence should be rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be available, because most States make it available."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,816.334,828.807,"--I -- I think, Your Honor, that -- that the judgment that they have made it available in some conscious way can't really be defended, because no one who has set the minimum age for imposing a sentence of life without parole has set it as young as -- as 13."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.628,839.83,So it would be -- it would be reasonable under your approach to have a different result in these two cases?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,848.619,849.538,--It would be conceivable.
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,876.722,878.657,"It seems to me, once -- excuse me."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,878.657,879.207,--Sorry.
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,879.207,885.911,It seems to me that one way to take that into effect is through our normal proportionality review and in a case by case.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,912.895,923.186,"I understand your point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think that's the way the Court should proceed, for two reasons: One -- one is that that kind of case by case analysis hasn't worked well for children."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.923,938.695,"Well, I thought -- I would have thought your argument that this is so rare suggests that maybe that analysis, to the extent it's permitted under State law, has worked well for children."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,938.695,942.331,"--Well, but -- but I -- I think in many ways it -- it hasn't."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.174,993.596,"Well, that's because death is different, is what we said, and because death is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst of the worst."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,997.981,1006.154,"--But I think it is, Your Honor, for -- for -- for the kinds of crimes that we are talking -- for non-homicides, life without parole is reserved for the worst of the worst."
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.282,1026.984,There are a lot of murderers who get life without parole.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1035.256,1038.375,"--Yes, they do, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.73,1053.567,"Call them the ""worse of the worse"" maybe, but they are not the worst of the worst."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1053.567,1056.769,"--Well, that's one way of characterizing it."
2009.08-7621,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1065.192,1068.144,What is the categorical rule that you would like us to adopt?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1068.144,1073.88,I would like you to adopt a rule that bans life without parole for any child under the age of 14.
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.784,1081.784,"But that would leave out Graham, then?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1091.842,1097.228,"Well, I support -- my client is 13, and there are differences between kids who are 14 and younger and kids who are older."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.282,1105.917,"Why not Thompson, where the line was 16?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1105.917,1110.638,"Well, I mean, the difficulty of course, is that -- and Thompson was a plurality opinion."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.581,1159.2,"What -- what about a homicide, a 13-year-old?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1159.2,1169.508,"It's our position that, based on the incidence of these sentences, that even between non-homicide and homicide, no child of 13 should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole."
2009.08-7621,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.066,1203.645,"But you -- you are differentiating your position based on young age from Graham's counsel, who said for murder, even in the case of a youthful offender, life without parole is an appropriate -- is an available sentence?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1203.645,1204.495,"That's -- that's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.23,1233.499,"So your line is 13, and for obvious reasons."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1256.778,1262.248,"--I guess we make these categorical distinctions in lots of contexts, not just in the death penalty context."
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1270.021,1272.39,"Well, but that's because that's a policy judgment by the legislature."
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1283.178,1284.613,"Well, it is this Court's history."
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.37,1322.738,"It depends on how horrible the crime is that they've committed, doesn't it?"
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1329.992,1335.88,"I think for -- for a child of 13 with regard to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1396.121,1397.971,--Could you go back through the statistics for me?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1408.094,1413.646,--There are 73 children 14 and younger who have been imprisoned for life without parole.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.14,1459.194,Can you do what you have just done with the category non-homicide cases?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1459.194,1459.811,Yes.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.811,1460.927,Life without parole?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1460.927,1461.563,Yes.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.563,1464.281,Under the age of 18 when committed?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1464.281,1465.015,Yes.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.481,1467.467,One hundred and eleven.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1469.919,1470.685,Seventy-seven.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1470.685,1471.719,Seventy-seven.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1475.221,1475.823,Six.
2009.08-7621,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.823,1476.556,Six.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1476.556,1482.976,"And with regard to children younger, we're also talking about just the universe of six, 14 and younger, all in Florida."
2009.08-7621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.844,1485.961,This is non-homicide.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1486.628,1487.713,"--Non-homicide, yes, sir."
2009.08-7621,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1499.438,1504.073,What is your response to the State's argument that these statistics are not peer-reviewed?
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1507.192,1510.544,"--Well, these statistics come from the States' Departments of Corrections, Your Honor."
2009.08-7621,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1526.255,1529.04,There's a certain number of States that didn't respond at all.
2009.08-7621,0,18048,bryan_stevenson,,1529.04,1529.79,There are very few.
2009.08-7621,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.646,1539.379,"Thank you, Mr. Stevenson."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1542.365,1550.704,"May it please the Court: As to the data, in our view, the data is unreliable."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1562.095,1563.195,You say it's suspect.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1573.652,1576.438,"--Justice Breyer, we have no data on--"
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.438,1577.604,Not in your own system?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1577.604,1578.504,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.504,1579.556,You don't know how many people in Florida--
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1579.556,1583.508,"I'm sorry, let me -- in Florida, it was the non-homicide."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.358,1589.912,"--Non-homicide, life without parole, under the age of 18 when committed."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1589.912,1590.948,--One hundred and fifty.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.948,1592.898,And they say 77?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1592.898,1593.648,They say 77.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1598.785,1599.418,What?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1600.137,1600.77,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.487,1603.672,You are speaking too fast.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1604.688,1605.656,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1605.656,1610.242,"Maybe if you raise the -- raise the lectern a bit -- no, the other way."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1610.242,1626.454,"The reason why is that the Annino study upon which they rely, which was generated just this past summer, doesn't count a non-homicide offense that happens to also be bundled with a homicide offense."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1632.775,1633.291,Okay.
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.727,1638.345,Wait.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1645.848,1647.45,--This is an individual that they don't count.
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.45,1648.2,Yes.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1648.2,1652.002,"And this is a person who committed, for example, an armed burglary."
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.002,1652.938,Right.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1652.938,1655.788,And then -- and put in jail and sentenced to life without parole.
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.788,1656.923,"For the burglary, not for the--"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1656.923,1658.09,"Right, non-homicide."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.637,1685.492,"--So -- so in your example, Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a robbery."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1693.646,1694.431,"Yes, and he was--"
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.431,1694.981,Yes.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1703.704,1704.787,"--Yes, sir."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1704.787,1705.471,Yes.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1739.544,1742.496,"By our number, it's 150."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.362,1750.083,Even though you gave -- said that the reason for the difference was a set of instances that I just asked you to put to the side.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1750.083,1751.185,"Well, okay."
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.291,1764.926,Which of these cases is worse?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1772.931,1776.317,"--Well, worse in which sense?"
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.269,1788.727,"My point is, if you had to consider youth as one of the factors that we consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come out?"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1788.727,1792.429,"--Well, I think certainly in this case we are at the far extreme."
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.214,1798.683,Off the charts on age or off the charts on violence?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1798.683,1799.366,"--Violence, I'm sorry."
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.988,1810.323,"I'm sorry, which one?"
2009.08-7621,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1810.323,1811.14,What do you mean it was done twice?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1812.925,1821.281,"--Two different -- the woman -- there was two counts of -- of sexual battery in the -- he committed the offense in two different ways upon this woman, and--"
2009.08-7621,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1821.281,1835.958,"So your adversary provided statistics to show that other people who have committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told, 10 years."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1850.115,1861.739,"--Well, when we look at the data for sexual battery, there's a distribution, and there's all kinds of factors underlying each of those sentences, and we have hundreds of sexual battery sentences in Florida."
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1884.522,1885.039,My--
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.039,1889.092,"So, what is the right -- go ahead."
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.092,1889.808,--Go ahead.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.808,1895.929,"I mean, I think if you want to address it, that the basic argument here is we want a bright line."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1948.397,1956.468,"Well, certainly -- and I've got, Mr. Chief Justice, questions about how does age play a role in proportionality and so forth."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.955,1963.891,That wasn't my point.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2043.859,2044.459,Sure.
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2101.714,2115.439,"Can you tell -- tell us something about that catchall that says an illegal sentence can be reopened at any time, illegal sentence?"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2125.378,2126.645,"--Well, that's incorrect."
2009.08-7621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2150.426,2151.776,That wouldn't apply to the Eighth Amendment?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2151.776,2159.43,"--No, because 3.850(b)(2) -- well, I think if, for example, at the time of sentencing--"
2009.08-7621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2159.43,2161.632,"We're talking about the first sentence of (B), I take it?"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2161.632,2162.432,--Right.
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2234.511,2249.771,"Now, what -- during the -- during the time, the postconviction period, would he -- he had an appointed lawyer at trial."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2259.46,2263.014,"Not as a matter of right, and he did file, I believe, a habeas--"
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2263.014,2267.382,"No, I mean -- I mean, he does -- he had representation in 2007."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2283.408,2285.76,"--Not -- not that I am aware of, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-7621,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2305.972,2307.589,What age was he at that point?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2307.589,2317.362,"--He would have been approximately, I think, 16, somewhere late teens, I believe; it was a few years after, '89, or '90."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.231,2333.491,"Do you want to comment on the district court, the -- the -- what -- what the -- your opponent says is that this Florida rule is a rule as the district court applied it that said the following: You have to file a challenge within 2 years."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2363.176,2365.276,That's not what those cases stand for.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.276,2365.795,Okay.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2384.424,2388.809,I don't believe there was any State brief filed in opposition to his appeal.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.927,2393.195,So the State didn't even deny what he was saying?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2393.195,2394.679,--Didn't deny -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.679,2399.449,So the State -- he says that whole section doesn't apply.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2406.52,2413.109,"No, because I think it was so obvious from the trial judge's order that he was relying on the procedural bar of 3.850(b)(2)."
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2416.644,2417.244,All right.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2417.244,2418.277,--I think -- I think Roper applies.
2009.08-7621,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.646,2449.896,"In any case, there is a circularity point here, I guess."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2478.432,2479.95,"That's exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.008,2508.935,"--You did say in -- in your brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition, that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2526.848,2530.717,"Well, he could file -- the next day he could file a--"
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.717,2532.669,--A new -- a new postconviction motion?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2532.669,2533.485,--Absolutely.
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.493,2555.248,Would -- would the standards applied in that situation be any different than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on his reading of the procedural bar?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2555.248,2557.117,--I'm--
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2557.117,2560.486,I'm just trying to see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference.
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2570.758,2583.916,"--Well, I think that -- but his winning would be hinging upon Graham, rather than winning in this forum today, on a new claim, that the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider in the first instance."
2009.08-7621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.916,2590.922,"--If I understand you correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2591.756,2602.146,"But that's premised upon this Court establishing a new fundamental right in Graham, a categorical rule, that would apply to him in his case, retroactive application."
2009.08-7621,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2606.265,2617.823,"What did the Florida -- what do the Florida courts do with that series of cases in your footnote, in the yellow brief, where it did apply Apprendi after?"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2622.358,2622.893,"Well, my--"
2009.08-7621,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2622.893,2624.293,--to consider the Apprendi challenges?
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2624.293,2637.117,"--My recollection is that the retroactivity was there, so that they would apply it, but, frankly, I cannot, as I stand here, I can't tell you all -- what all the--"
2009.08-7621,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2637.117,2652.912,"If you are wrong and they did do exactly what your adversary said and considered the issue of the legality of the sentence under Apprendi, does that vitiate your argument here?"
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2656.131,2662.018,"--Well, I don't think that a court here or there that may deviate from the rule would establish the precedent."
2009.08-7621,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.948,2686.65,"Well, if it's not consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground."
2009.08-7621,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2701.393,2706.928,"Well, there is no question that 3.850(b)(2) is consistently and regularly applied."
2009.08-7621,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.36,2756.894,"Thank you, Mr. Makar."
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2759.995,2761.263,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-7621,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2788.581,2789.731,You are missing the point.
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2822.235,2824.587,"Well, I -- and that's what I disagree with, Your Honor."
2009.08-7621,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2846.381,2862.593,"And you address this in footnote 35 of your reply brief, and it would have been a little bit helpful if you had raised it initially, so that the State would have had an opportunity to reply, but you introduced the citation there with ""for example"", and then you cite some cases."
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2863.593,2870.949,"Yes -- yes, there are, Justice Alito, and -- and, again, I just want to contextualize why this is the way it is."
2009.08-7621,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2880.304,2893.295,There are -- there are other cases in which the lower Florida courts have used -- have said that this particular subsection is appropriate for raising a constitutional challenge.
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2893.295,2893.895,That's correct.
2009.08-7621,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.703,2918.242,"I thought that in your cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised the question of the adequate State ground in the second question."
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2918.242,2924.665,"We did -- well, what we raised was that, without this Court intervening, that people like Joe Sullivan would likely never get review."
2009.08-7621,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2929.532,2934.603,"But there was a question that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't discuss it at all."
2009.08-7621,2,18048,bryan_stevenson,,2951.982,2952.482,--Yes.
2009.08-7621,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3035.668,3037.754,"Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Makar."
