1983.82-1684,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,65.608,72.178,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.274,231.916,"Mr. Horowitz, do the Appellees suggest that maybe this was really an attempt by the government to get unauthorized entry into the premises?"
1983.82-1684,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,234.868,238.82,I just do not think there is any support for that in the record.
1983.82-1684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.483,271.724,"The question is not really before us here, of course, but do you think the statutory authority under the Act to enter and inspect the premises is possibly invalid under Barlow's?"

1983.82-1684,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,285.051,296.007,"--If they did I think unlike this case Barlow's would be quite relevant and there would be a serious question under Barlow's, but the question would be whether Barlow's was distinguishable or not."

1983.82-1684,1,40240,richard_g_peterson,,1108.064,1108.681,Yes.
1983.82-1684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.681,1110.448,Where do we find the stipulation?
1983.82-1684,1,40240,richard_g_peterson,,1112.283,1113.802,I believe it is in the--
1983.82-1684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.802,1117.754,Is it in the appendix somewhere?
1983.82-1684,1,40240,richard_g_peterson,,1117.754,1120.972,"--Yes, it is in the appendix, Justice Rehnquist."
