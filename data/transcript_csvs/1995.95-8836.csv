1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-8836, Ellis Wayne Felker v. Tony Turpin."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,10.556,13.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.612,153.48,"Has what, Mr. Monaghan?"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,153.48,156.766,"From time out of mind has existed as an appellate remedy, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.424,368.536,"Well, but if it is, indeed, an appellate... if the original writ of habeas corpus, as you say, is appellate in this case, then it does seem that the prisoner could obtain relief, but certainly it does not seem, under cases like Yerger, that the warden could."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,368.536,372.254,"That's exactly right, Your Honor, but I think that that... I think first of all, two things."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.86,391.049,"Well, but in an appellate situation, supposing the district court grants a writ of habeas corpus, the State or the Government can appeal from the grant."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,391.049,391.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.848,416.967,You say the court of appeals is just really screening--
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,416.967,434.244,"The court of appeals is supposed to engage in a gatekeeping function here, but one of the points we want to make is that the court of appeals decided the merits of this case, and that's a point which I'm going to address, which is the... and it decided it in an egregious manner, if you actually study what it did."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.998,441.332,--Yes.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,452.556,453.59,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,453.59,480.457,"But I take it your theory of... that sort of neutralizes the warden's complaint is not merely that there is an asymmetry in the very structure of habeas practice, but that the result of the probable cause determination when it goes against the warden ultimately is merged in what happens in the district court, and it's like many preliminary orders that are merged before any ultimate review takes place."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,480.457,493.033,"That's... yes, Your Honor, and if there is an asymmetry, if there were, it would hardly strike me as a point of great substance, given the tradition of the writ of habeas corpus."
1995.95-8836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.36,558.142,"It suggests, though, does it not, that it was... Mr. Monaghan, that it was omitted inadvertently, because what does come across from that brief was the intention to foreclose any review if the appellate panel refused to certify."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,558.142,573.902,"Well, if the argument is that it was inadvertently omitted, I might say that this Court is not authorized to write legislation that Congress might have written but didn't write."
1995.95-8836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.171,613.377,"Mr. Monaghan, what about jurisdiction in this Court under the All Writs Act by way of writ of mandamus, or something of that sort?"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,613.377,616.279,"--On behalf of the warden, or on behalf of--"
1995.95-8836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.279,616.931,Either.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,619.648,658.439,"--That's a hard question, Your Honor, because it doesn't impair jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, either, and there is at least one case, House v. Mayo, in which effectively habeas corpus relief was given under section 1651, but there is a body of case law in your Court, last invoked in an opinion by Justice Scalia last year, or early this year, which says that section 106 is inoperative if there's a specific provision that deals with the proposed remedy, and so that brings you back to 2241(a), and for that reason I was unwilling to brief that point."
1995.95-8836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.439,664.177,How would 2241(a) work on your interpretation?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,687.44,707.004,"Well, the various briefs, if you look at them carefully, sharply divide on what happens if you have authority to entertain the writ and, given the limited time constraints and the lack of developments in the brief, we can only give you our initial thoughts about this."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.859,751.029,"Well, our Rule 20 says you have to have sought relief everywhere else before coming here for an original writ, doesn't it?"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,751.029,751.964,And that's our position.
1995.95-8836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.363,837.135,"Before you go on to the second point, that first point is the only way in which we could get into that interpretation of what 106 really means?"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,837.135,837.404,No.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.822,867.007,Question Number 2--
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,873.927,877.462,Yes.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.814,886.568,To what extent do the provisions of 106 apply to this Court in its exercise of our jurisdiction.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,886.568,892.372,"--Yes, and that is a... that's a question which we may have flubbed."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.767,920.308,You agree that the provisions of 106 do apply to this Court when we are exercising our original habeas jurisdiction?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,920.308,923.11,"--Well, the only provisions that could apply to this Court--"
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.11,923.96,That's what I mean.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,923.96,929.914,"--Yes, the only provisions that could apply are the substantive standards of 106(b), and--"
1995.95-8836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.914,931.497,Do you mean (b)(1) and (b)(2)?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,931.497,934.013,--(b)(2).
1995.95-8836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.186,1026.291,What would the role of miscarriage of justice have been in the days when we had no criminal Federal jurisdiction at all?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1026.291,1029.261,You had it under the All Writs Act.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.733,1048.805,"Well, there was certainly a lot of criminal convictions in the 19th Century, you could not appeal them and they were not reviewed here."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1048.805,1058.244,"They were not reviewed, and the difference was in the 19th Century what the... if you look... there's a nice discussion by Dallin Oaks in his article."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.988,1072.838,But not--
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1072.838,1073.94,--Not routinely.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.94,1077.474,--Not challenging final judgments of conviction.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1077.474,1084.997,We... the first... the challenges to the final judgments conviction really don't emerge until 1873.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.997,1085.613,"Siebold, yes."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1085.613,1098.055,"Siebold, Ex parte Lang, but they come, incidentally, Your Honor, from a Court that also said that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is a privilege of immunity of national citizenship."
1995.95-8836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.767,1158.093,"Well, we got into this when you indicated that under... I think this was your... the purport of your remarks, that under 2241 we will be construing what (b)(2) means."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1164.597,1167.984,The Government argues that it does.
1995.95-8836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.315,1193.617,"I don't understand why the... the question arises, is it exhaustive."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1195.635,1196.085,No.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.085,1196.635,Well--
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1196.635,1197.336,No.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.47,1200.638,"--Well, maybe... maybe--"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1200.638,1201.905,"Let me give you an... oh, sorry."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.905,1207.359,--Maybe Congress thought this was as much of a miscarriage of justice as they wanted the courts to look into.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1207.359,1219.934,"That may be, Your Honor, and if that's the construction which you put on it, then it raises substantial questions whether or not... not necessarily in the Federal court, but in the State court broader postconviction relief must be available."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.673,1254.84,Why?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1254.84,1265.815,"Because the Due Process Clause would require postconviction relief in those circumstances in our view, so long as Palko v. Connecticut and Rochin v. California are the law of the land."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.815,1270.033,"Well, you know, Rochin is a fact-specific case if there ever was one."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1271.969,1273.769,The standard is not fact-specific.
1995.95-8836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.075,1325.869,--What do you think of the suggestion in one of the amicus briefs that the statute really means that you can get relief if you present new evidence that ought to substantially undermine the reviewing court's faith in the fundamental justice of the verdict?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1325.869,1326.536,We certainly--
1995.95-8836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.536,1328.055,There was a suggestion that that's--
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1328.055,1328.805,"--Yes, we could certainly--"
1995.95-8836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.805,1329.121,--what the statute means.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1329.121,1334.225,"--And what we would do is to argue that the statute does mean that, and if it doesn't--"
1995.95-8836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.225,1337.511,And is there a way of getting to there with the words of the statute as they are?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1337.511,1340.546,"--Well, I don't know how to respond to that."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1343.315,1344.598,Why should we try to get there?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1344.598,1345.9,"--You should try to get there, absolutely."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.9,1346.333,Why?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1346.333,1350.235,Because you don't want to have a... because the historic--
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.235,1354.039,Why shouldn't we just try to apply the statute as written?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1357.325,1358.041,"--I don't think it's a torture, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.041,1358.775,--that's not there.
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1358.775,1363.994,"I don't think it's a torture, and to say you're going to apply the statute as written presupposes that this statute is quite plain."
1995.95-8836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1378.921,1389.046,"Mr. Monaghan, if we were to agree with the panel when it said, old law, no law... new law, we would come out the same way on this petition, if we were to agree with that--"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1389.046,1389.546,Uh-huh.
1995.95-8836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.546,1397.133,"--position, then there would be no occasion for us to determine whether our current Rule 20.4(a), sets the standard--"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1397.133,1397.902,"Yes, I--"
1995.95-8836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.902,1400.853,"--It just says rarely granted, or this new statute."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1404.571,1416.779,"--No, there would be another question you would have to face, and let me say, Your Honor, the panel says that the instruction is given twice, and then it applies harmless error analysis."
1995.95-8836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.546,1549.05,"Mr. Monaghan, can I ask you a question I want to be sure I have your view on?"
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1562.774,1575.517,"--I'm glad that you asked that, Your Honor, because I have opened the Government's brief, and you... the... what is being appealed from in this case is the denial of the certificate to go forward to the district--"
1995.95-8836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.517,1578.219,So you think we have appellate jurisdiction over the action of the court of appeals?
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1578.219,1581.504,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I would like to read to you from the Government's brief."
1995.95-8836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.124,1669.979,"Well, I thought the Government was taking this position, that our review is appellate in the sense that it is not within the meaning of Article III original, but that it is an original proceeding in the sense that it's a proceeding before us in the first instance, and I would suppose that if it is treated in that way, we could consider as an evidentiary matter what may be on the record below, even though we are not, in the conventional sense, reviewing that record on an appellate process."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1669.979,1674.364,That would be completely contrary to the whole practice in the 19th Century.
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.953,1686.339,"And yet you read Ex parte Grossman, you don't seem to have had that in mind."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1688.54,1695.027,"The 19th Century... Dallin Oaks' article sets this out quite clearly, and we have many cases which we could provide."
1995.95-8836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.027,1696.379,"Well, there is a judgment."
1995.95-8836,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1698.079,1700.348,"That's right... no, you're not... that is not the practice."
1995.95-8836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.095,1722.245,"Very well, Mr. Monaghan."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1726.831,1728.081,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.341,1795.376,"That's not a very specific position, Ms. Boleyn."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1795.376,1796.828,--Mr. Chief Justice.
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.828,1806.684,What is your position with respect to the existence of the original habeas jurisdiction in this Court after this act of Congress was passed?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1806.684,1827.264,"With specific reference to that, Mr. Chief Justice, our position is that, while the original writ exists on paper, because the new act does not mention 2241, that there was no intent of Congress to allow the applicability of 2241 to successive habeas corpus petitions, so it does not exist for that purpose."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.966,1831.835,"Yes, well, how do you distinguish ex parte Yerger?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1831.835,1843.291,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, again I believe what earlier has been said by other justices, that there... our position is that this is a permissible restriction."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.291,1849.278,How do you distinguish Ex parte Yerger from this case on the jurisdictional point?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1849.278,1857.466,"Well, I think that this Court has recognized exceptions to its jurisdiction both in the constitutional venue under Article III--"
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.466,1858.716,Are you familiar with the Yerger case?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1858.716,1862.184,"--Yes, Your Honor, but I'm not familiar with what exactly you're asking me to respond to."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.184,1885.883,"Well, in Yerger, as I understand it, the Court said that the repeal effected in the statute considered in the McCardle case, which had repealed the jurisdiction of the Court to hear an appeal from a lower court decision denying certiorari, in Yerger they said, well, that's true, Congress took away that appellate jurisdiction, but it didn't take away our original jurisdiction."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1885.883,1890.77,"Your Honor, I don't think that original jurisdiction is affected, if that's what you're saying."
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.903,1916.671,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1945.472,1946.707,You do not--
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.707,1949.059,I thought from your brief the answer was yes.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1949.059,1957.48,--You have the right under your... under writ... under 2241 to look at extraordinary cases for extraordinary relief.
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.283,1962.633,So you're answer's yes.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1962.633,1965.235,--You have the right... that right still exists.
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.057,2017.72,"But Ms. Boleyn, part of the Yerger decision was to clarify that although it's an original writ, the jurisdiction that this Court exercises is appellate, because apart from the original jurisdiction that Article III gives to this Court, there can be no other authority other than appellate in this Court."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2033.896,2042.751,"--Because, Your Honor, I believe that what's being done in this case is attempting to substitute, and under petitioner's view this Court would be substituted for the lower court."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2061.013,2061.565,"Well, it--"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2061.565,2063.732,The appellate court jurisdiction doesn't encompass factfinders.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.851,2066.034,--I didn't mean to interrupt you.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2086.347,2086.996,That's a possible reading.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.184,2093.953,But that's not what the act says.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2097.755,2098.138,--Yes.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.138,2101.957,"--only to the relationship between district and courts of appeals, isn't that correct?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2101.957,2102.307,Yes.
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.12,2130.959,"But then wouldn't we be making the same sort of factual, fact-specific determinations on the prima facie case issue?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2132.911,2140.332,"Yes, and I think that's exactly what we're asking the Court not to do, not to denigrate the Court's Article III jurisdiction by going and becoming a factfinder."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.466,2182.678,"So your position basically is if the court of appeals under this act turns down the petitioner, that there's no occasion for the exercise of our original jurisdiction even though it exists, because he had another avenue of relief but he was found to not meet the standards for it?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2182.678,2189.332,"--That's our position, except perhaps in those cases where, as Mr. Felker did, the jurisdiction of the Court as a whole has been challenged."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.406,2207.309,"Well, mandamus is no more readily granted here than original habeas corpus, I think."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2209.428,2227.29,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say when I'm saying that is that exceptional relief such as the type that the petitioner is seeking in this case, for example, that there's no jurisdiction of the Court, or that the act is unconstitutional, is exactly the type of situation that the Court might want to exercise its jurisdiction."
1995.95-8836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2227.29,2235.544,"Well, why would the mandamus petition be in order to protect our jurisdiction, because I thought we had no jurisdiction."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2244.918,2245.551,"Your Honor, I think--"
1995.95-8836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.551,2246.601,So how does mandamus work?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2246.601,2250.303,"--Your Honor, I think that perhaps I was not clear about what I was saying."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.894,2297.886,"Then he shouldn't be able... I take it it's your position he should not be able to invoke that original extraordinary jurisdiction, as you put it, for any purpose that would result in his getting substantive relief."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2297.886,2298.536,Correct.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2298.536,2303.438,You are saying the only thing he can litigate under that jurisdiction is jurisdiction itself.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2303.438,2304.29,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2304.29,2315.413,"So that if you win on that point, in fact there will never be again an extraordinary case in which this Court might invoke its original jurisdiction to review the particularities of the case."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2315.413,2318.55,"Not for the particularities of the case, but only if there's something overriding."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2319.233,2325.203,"So that means... I mean, the practical effect of that, them, is that our original jurisdiction is, in fact, gone."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2325.203,2325.854,--Yes.
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.854,2327.203,"I don't understand, then."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2367.863,2368.899,My answer's no.
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.899,2370.765,"Well, your brief suggested yes."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2370.765,2373.351,"Let me see if I can explain myself more fully, Justice--"
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.351,2381.54,"And the reason that we don't have jurisdiction to do that, given you're here and everything is... I'm just asking you to explain, just want you wanted to--"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2381.54,2399.352,"--I've been trying to do... Justice, I think what we're saying is, if someone brought a claim of innocence, Congress has already spoken and said that primarily claims of innocence in the first instance under Georgia law ought to be to the State courts, anything from a motion for new trial, an extraordinary motion for a new trial, or a petition for clemency."
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.332,2423.717,"--I'm sorry, the case I'm quoting is 106 is met."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2437.044,2438.727,--You should not review it.
1995.95-8836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.727,2439.662,Because--
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2439.662,2453.153,"You should not review it because he petitioner is seeking to obtain habeas corpus relief from this Court as prohibited by the statute, and the only thing that they could be trying to do is get you to review the prima facie decision not to go forward."
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2453.153,2457.957,--Then I don't understand your position that 2241 exists.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2460.159,2460.959,Because--
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2460.959,2464.294,But now you seem to be saying it is effectively repealed.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2465.077,2466.646,"--Effectively repealed, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2479.554,2482.839,"So now your position is, it was repealed by implication."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2482.839,2483.775,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.775,2488.41,"And it's a dead letter, so it's not... it doesn't exist."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2488.41,2501.752,"And, of course, alternatively, if the Court finds it does exist, what we're asking this Court to do is to make it rare and extraordinary in a situation where, perhaps, jurisdiction or some other unusual situation might be envisioned."
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.96,2522.65,"Well, if it is preserved, if 2241 continues, not just on paper--"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2522.65,2523.316,--Right.
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.316,2532.605,"--what more would you propose than what our rule already says, which is exceptional circumstances rarely granted?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2532.605,2545.329,"I think, Your Honor, what we have proposed is that the Court interpreted... there's another portion of that rule that talks about that the petitioner has to establish that he has no other forum available to litigate his claim and no other avenues of relief."
1995.95-8836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.877,2591.36,But that doesn't answer the new claim.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2596.364,2597.948,Where he has a new and different claim?
1995.95-8836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.948,2599.066,"He alleges a new claim, yes."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2599.066,2599.7,Well--
1995.95-8836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.7,2605.97,"Why doesn't he just say, I presented it to the court of appeals, they denied it, there's no other avenue available?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2607.756,2613.057,"--I think because in a new claim situation, the Court bars new claims for lots of reasons."
1995.95-8836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.121,2646.564,"Ms. Boleyn, your interpretation of the new law, and your position that 2241 is effectively repealed, differs from that of the Solicitor General, I take it."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2646.564,2647.747,I believe that's true.
1995.95-8836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.602,2662.368,"May I ask also, you referred earlier to mandamus."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2677.314,2681.865,--I think this Court in its rules refers to exceptional relief.
1995.95-8836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.4,2684.933,Assume we've got an exceptional case.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2701.595,2702.912,--Probably so.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.087,2721.157,"Well, but if you're allowing that, what happens to your argument that we ought to construe or ought to find an implication?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2736.852,2737.285,Right.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2737.285,2751.278,"But in fact, on your view, something like that is allowed if we exercise a mandamus jurisdiction, so why shouldn't we construe, even on your view, our 2241 jurisdiction at least that broadly?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2751.278,2758.516,"I think the short answer to your question is, we want extraordinary relief to even be more extraordinary in the context of the success of the petition."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2758.516,2761.068,2241 doesn't sound extraordinary enough.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2761.9,2770.906,"I guess that's what we're saying that it... by your own definition of it in Rule 20, it's supposed to be rare, extraordinary, drastic remedy."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2771.473,2773.791,"--Well, I mean, that sounds like mandamus, too, doesn't it?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2773.791,2778.845,"--Well, I think that what the petitioner is trying to do is make an extraordinary remedy an ordinary remedy."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2780.981,2797.741,"No, but you're saying even as an extraordinary remedy, your answers to Justice Breyer, Justice Ginsburg and me made it very clear that under 2241, save for in the narrow sense, jurisdictional litigation, 2241 no longer, on your view, gives us power to do anything."
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2797.741,2799.859,--I think you have limited exceptional power.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2800.993,2802.044,Even under 2241?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2802.044,2803.127,--Not under 2241.
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.127,2804.246,But under mandamus.
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2804.246,2807.364,"Right, and perhaps under the All Writs Act as well, in some sense."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.505,2828.793,But why don't you take the position that we should construe those avenues as equally barred in the spirit of this new act?
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2828.793,2830.843,"I think I am, or perhaps I'm just not being clear."
1995.95-8836,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.062,2837.049,"No, but you said... I thought you left a place for mandamus, and you left a place for the exercise of the All Writs Act, which I guess--"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2837.049,2845.203,"--I guess my position is that all extraordinary relief has not been eliminated by virtue of the act, but that extraordinary relief should remain extraordinary."
1995.95-8836,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2848.589,2854.409,"--Well then, why not call it what is the most accurate fit for what's sought here?"
1995.95-8836,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2877.108,2880.226,"I'm not asking the Court, Your Honor, to recharacterize it as mandamus."
1995.95-8836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.438,2899.04,"Thank you, Ms. Boleyn."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2901.64,2913.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-8836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2979.989,2986.909,What exactly is it that the Court would be reviewing under its original habeas jurisdiction?
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2990.528,2991.563,"Yes, it is."
1995.95-8836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2991.563,2999.133,--would we be reviewing the denial by the court of appeals of the permission to file a successive petition?
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2999.133,3000.402,"No, not under these circumstances."
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.03,3020.264,You mean a State court decision?
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3020.264,3025.534,Whatever decision is holding the person in detention.
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.534,3029.422,"Well, this is a very kind of confused point in our cases, I think."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3029.422,3029.922,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.922,3039.36,"But we have to have some... if it is indeed appellate jurisdiction, we have to have somewhere where the prisoner has been ordered confined."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3043.079,3046.447,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3070.999,3071.365,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3076.736,3077.385,That's correct.
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.385,3087.508,--those decisions in... but wouldn't... it seems to me the most logical analysis to... analogy to that is to say it is the court of appeals which has refused to allow the--
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3087.508,3087.874,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3087.874,3088.46,--issuance of the writ--
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3088.46,3088.81,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.81,3089.343,--of habeas corpus.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3089.343,3089.81,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.81,3113.076,"But in Yerger what was... why I'm confused about it is that Yerger says that the 1868 act, that was the act at issue there, repeals so much of the act as authorizes an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court, so there they seem to repeal the section that would authorize an appeal, and yet it was still in our appellate jurisdiction."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3121.431,3137.607,"Oh, I... as I was indicating to the Chief Justice, it's complicated by the fact that by McCardle and Yerger were cases having to do with the Federal court system, and had nothing to do with State detention, which is presented by this particular case."
1995.95-8836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3137.607,3140.826,"--Well, so are you changing your answer to my question?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3141.595,3148.165,"The Court would not, on original habeas, be reviewing a determination by the court of appeals."
1995.95-8836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.486,3163.508,--It would be the same as if the district court under prior practice had been asked to issue a writ against the warden.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3163.508,3167.226,"After all, the warden is here as the respondent."
1995.95-8836,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3167.226,3172.714,"So what it means is, it is appellate in the Article III sense because it can't be original."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3172.714,3173.647,That's correct.
1995.95-8836,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3173.647,3183.755,But it is original in the sense that it is going to the merits of the habeas claim rather than to the specific determination by the court of appeals that no prima facie case was made.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3183.755,3184.172,That's right.
1995.95-8836,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3185.738,3186.14,Yes.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3186.14,3188.992,--in violation of the constitutional laws or treaties of the United States.
1995.95-8836,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3188.992,3200.448,"And I would suppose that in making that determination we would be free to look, on your view, at whatever had been presented in the court of appeals simply as a convenient place where evidence was reposing."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3200.448,3201.383,That's correct.
1995.95-8836,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.383,3220.445,"May I also ask if it's your view that, assuming... we're all very doubtful of some of these things... that there is such an original, quote, appellate habeas in this Court, would 2241(b) nevertheless apply and authorize this Court to transfer for a hearing the case to a district court, in your view?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3220.445,3222.797,I'm not very clear about that.
1995.95-8836,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.538,3236.057,But it's on the books.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3236.057,3242.126,It's simply dismissed these cases and sent them to whatever court is competent to resolve those issues.
1995.95-8836,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3281.001,3299.296,"But we might take the position that the gatekeeper determination having been made, the district court could have no jurisdiction, so we couldn't send it to the district court, and if we needed evidence taken in a really extraordinary case, I suppose we could use a master, isn't that true?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3299.296,3300.646,"Yes, that is also possible."
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3328.379,3330.831,Where do we find 10... that portion.
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3330.831,3337.569,"That's at point 4 and 5a of the appendix to our brief, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-8836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.228,3439.486,"Well, but why aren't those two readily met by simply saying, I can't go some place else because the court of appeals said I couldn't?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3439.486,3441.202,"--Well, I think it is."
1995.95-8836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.764,3463.834,"But the fact that relief is available elsewhere is no longer an obstacle to that relief, you say."
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3463.834,3481.379,"Well, certainly it's been exhausted, but I think that what the Court would do is say that the fact that the person has been denied, the applicant has been denied through the gatekeeper process, does not represent an exceptional circumstance that would warrant this Court's consideration of that application."
1995.95-8836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3481.379,3488.55,"In the case of an extraordinary error by a circuit court, would we have mandamus jurisdiction?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3488.55,3499.008,"Justice Kennedy, I think mandamus probably is used the way it's been used, to deal with ministerial acts, the failure of lower courts to perform ministerial acts."
1995.95-8836,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.196,3513.45,"Well, following up on Justice Kennedy's thought, what about the common law writ of certiorari that was used in House v. Mayo?"
1995.95-8836,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3513.45,3523.806,"I think that since the statutory original certiorari jurisdiction was available, there would be no need for this Court to use that particular common law writ."
1995.95-8836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3523.806,3524.992,"Thank you, General Days."
