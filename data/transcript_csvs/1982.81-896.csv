1982.81-896,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.742,We'll hear arguments next in Perry Education Association against Perry Local Association.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,100.569,103.411,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-896,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.384,673.398,"Speaking of threshold questions, counsel, at some point I hope you're going to address the jurisdiction question."
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,675.038,679.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, it was not my intention to address it in oral argument."
1982.81-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.423,853.623,"Mr. Chanin, what does the record show here was the use by others of the mail facilities?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,853.623,897.041,"What the record shows, Justice, is that subsequent to the designation of PEA as the exclusive representative in 1977 the mail facilities have been used by PEA in its representational capacity and by the YMCA, the YWCA, the Cub Scouts and certain parochial schools, all organizations which we submit are on their face youth-oriented civil organizations which are engaged in activities that would be of interest and educational relevance to students."
1982.81-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.041,904.836,Does the record tell us any more about the specific uses than simply the identity of the users?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,904.836,912.865,"No, the record indeed says nothing about the specific uses by PEA or by any of the other groups."
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.904,931.185,"Is it possible to say, Mr. Chanin, whether any group besides... is it the PLEA is your group's rival?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,931.185,933.497,It is our rival.
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.497,934.121,Yeah.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,939.979,942.696,There is nothing in the record to indicate that.
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.696,958.284,"Does that lead to... can you then generalize as to what the school district's standard for access to these mailboxes was, or are you left pretty much to having several points and trying to figure out where the line goes?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,958.284,961.967,"Oh, no, we have no trouble whatsoever identifying the standard."
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.487,1002.53,Can you give us some examples of communications from your client to the teachers that would be school business as you describe it?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1002.53,1010.575,"Not from the record, Justice Stevens, but I can tell you what this union and other unions typically include in their communications."
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1022.788,1025.554,And what a stinker the other union is.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1025.554,1026.615,"Pardon me, sir?"
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1026.615,1030.097,And what a stinker the competing union is.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1030.097,1033.595,I think that may come in occasionally.
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.662,1070.16,"Just taking one of your examples, describing the result of a particular grievance between one union member and the school board, I assume, why would that be disseminated to the entire union membership?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1070.16,1072.706,--Because the resolution of the grievance--
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.706,1073.564,To tell them what a fine job they've been doing?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1073.564,1079.944,--The resolution of a grievance that arises under a collective bargaining agreement does not have one-on-one impact.
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1106.906,1123.307,What would happen if Congress passed a law which said that the NEA shall have the authority to send its mail with a frank on it and denied that to all other organizations?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1123.307,1126.353,"I think that law would be unconstitutional, Your Honor."
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.353,1128.115,And the difference is what?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1128.115,1138.472,The NEA does not hold in that context this special status vis a vis the constituency to who that franked mail would go.
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.222,1181.079,"Well, it'll be a fair fight, won't it?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1184.502,1187.123,"That is not the fact, Your Honor."
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.778,1192.091,I'm not talking about Indiana law.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1192.091,1195.9,"--Well, I would like to just focus in on the fight, sir."
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1209.209,1211.022,Does that give them the right to use those boxes?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1211.022,1213.928,They will be during the representation campaign.
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.928,1215.488,Now where'd I get that from?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1215.488,1216.658,That's in the record.
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1217.691,1218.299,Where?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1219.598,1222.971,"--It is in the request for admissions, the responses."
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.985,1271.201,"Mr. Chanin, state law just allows it?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1271.201,1273.591,State law requires equal access.
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.591,1278.415,"Yes, but during the insulation period state law doesn't require unilateral access."
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1280.338,1282.727,"That is correct, it allows it as a bargainable matter."
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1282.727,1288.069,"I sure wish you could point that out in the record, or do I have to go look for it?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1288.069,1291.723,I can point it point.
1982.81-896,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.723,1295.128,"Okay, I'll find it, if it's there."
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1295.128,1298.423,"Let me, if I may, get back to the point--"
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.423,1303.922,"While you've been interrupted already, just to clarify, is the school board a party or was it a party below?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1303.922,1308.137,--The school board was a party in the district court and the Court of Appeals.
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.073,1314.025,Does the school board have any interest in your prevailing?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1314.025,1315.324,I'm sure it does.
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.324,1318.323,What is the interest of the school board that's at stake?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1318.323,1335.659,"We would like to believe that its interests are that we prevail, that what we are seeking here is to sustain a provision which we believe and which this Court has indicated contributes to labor peace, to labor stability, and to a more rational relationship."
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.659,1340.265,"But the provision in dispute was adopted by the board at the request of your clients, was it not?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1340.265,1343.782,"It was adopted through collective bargaining, in the give and take of collective bargaining."
1982.81-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.782,1353.808,"And is there any reason why, had the union not been interested in preventing your rival union from having access, is there any reason to believe that the school board independently would have concluded that this was a desirable provision?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1355.839,1361.396,"I think there is reason to conclude that, although I can't look into the mind of this school board."
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.913,1413.407,"Well, even if the school board weren't all that happy to have either union in there, I suppose it has some interest in keeping use of the teachers' mailboxes by outside groups at a minimum."
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1418.781,1420.641,I expect that's true.
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.508,1451.018,"In the course of the bargaining and in the development of this rule, was your claim in the bargaining, your demand, that your organization have access and your rival organization not have access, or simply that your organization have access--"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1451.018,1455.686,"I only know, Your Honor, and the record only indicates what came out of the bargaining."
1982.81-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.265,1461.262,--The exclusive access.
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1461.262,1462.639,"The exclusive access, yes."
1982.81-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1462.639,1471.058,"Now, the SG has filed something with us indicating that your union may have to pay postage, isn't that right?"
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1471.058,1475.383,"Your Honor, yes, they have, they have."
1982.81-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1496.841,1500.765,So this exclusive privilege may not be worth much in the future?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1500.765,1504.871,"--Well, I think that is an overstatement, I would like to believe, of what they say."
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.637,1507.916,Is this really before us?
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1507.916,1508.462,--Pardon me?
1982.81-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.462,1513.024,I took it all that the Solicitor General might have wanted was a footnote in the opinion disavowing any--
1982.81-896,0,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1513.024,1514.366,At best it is a footnote.
1982.81-896,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1728.36,1737.886,Mr. Zweig.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,1737.886,1740.12,Thank you.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1828.315,1834.11,"Are you going to leave the issue of jurisdiction to your brief, as your adversary has?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,1834.11,1837.608,I would be glad to comment on the question of jurisdiction.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.608,1838.985,I wish you would.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,1838.985,1851.228,The Perry Education Association has attempted to invoke this Court's appellate jurisdiction on the basis of 28 United States Code Section 1254.
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.434,1926.228,"Supposing an Indiana school district adopted, outside of the labor context, a regulation saying that no black armbands shall be worn in the school by the students."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,1930.634,1941.206,"We would say that is appealable, because that would be a unilateral action by the school district, as opposed to something that was the result of a collective bargaining process."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.206,1956.013,"But supposing the school district held intense hearings and heard all sorts of groups on this black armband question, and one group demanded one thing and one demanded another thing, and the school board finally came out and said, this is the way we resolve it."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,1961.277,1963.543,We would say that that is a different situation.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.211,2014.614,How was the contract approved?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2014.614,2017.113,It was approved at an open school board meeting.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.113,2023.86,So it took a legislative act to approve it?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2023.86,2028.391,In one sense of the word it was a legislative act.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.391,2030.372,"Well, it was, wasn't it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2030.372,2035.746,Except that under Indiana law that wouldn't be considered to be a legislative act.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.835,2060.628,"What if the school board in advance passes a resolution at one of its meetings that, our negotiators are authorized to agree to an exclusive use provision in the contract?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2060.628,2070.28,"If that went through the appropriate process and so on and that was a regulation that was adopted, yes--"
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.28,2074.262,"That's all we know, is that they adopted it and authorized it."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2078.558,2080.118,--That might be a legislative enactment.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.118,2088.148,"Well, do you think it's different, do you think it's different if after the fact the school board approves it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2088.148,2089.77,We do think it's different.
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2089.77,2091.832,How?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2092.772,2103.125,We think it's different because it is the culmination of a process where two parties are negotiating over a point.
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2113.81,2121.118,But is the process any different in the advance authorization than in the subsequent ratification?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2121.118,2130.255,The process is different in the way the system sets up the--
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2130.255,2134.66,You think the school board has a little less in the way of options in the second situation?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2134.66,2143.017,"--The options I think are much more great in the collective bargaining process, probably, than in the legislative enactment process."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.017,2144.218,"Well, what if you're right?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2146.0,2153.823,We would ask this Court to find that there is no probable jurisdiction under that statute--
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.823,2154.825,And do what?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2154.825,2157.917,--Consider this case as a petition for a writ of certiorari.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.917,2159.571,And then decide it?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2159.571,2165.054,"Decide whether or not to take the case, initially to assume jurisdiction over it."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.054,2169.02,"Would you say then we should dismiss the appeal and then deny cert, is that it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2169.02,2172.36,"Yes, that's what we are suggesting."
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2172.36,2178.062,"Or, having heard it, dismiss it as improvidently granted?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2178.062,2182.796,"Yes, under either form."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.482,2245.302,"You do agree, don't you, that in the federal context that this exclusive use of the exclusive representative is fairly usual?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2245.302,2248.191,It is fairly usable certainly in the military area--
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.191,2249.205,"Usual, usual."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2249.205,2251.549,"--Usual, in the military area."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.78,2280.288,"Do you agree or not that 5 U.S.C. 7116(a)(3) provides for, is a general provision requiring exclusive use by bargaining agents--"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2280.288,2284.819,I have to frankly say that I'm not personally familiar with that particular statute.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.819,2287.849,"--Well, if it is, it certainly is a Congressional declaration."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2287.849,2288.317,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2383.449,2392.165,Sometimes schools allow political candidates to come and make speeches in the evening in many states.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2400.397,2412.641,"I think that a school district which allowed, for example, the Democrats to come in and speak to the teachers would be hard-pressed to deny any other political group access to those, to the facilities for the purposes of--"
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.641,2414.045,Just hard-pressed?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2414.045,2417.152,--I think it would be a violation of the First Amendment.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2417.152,2425.338,"Do you say, Mr. Zweig, that your case depends on our agreeing with you that this is a limited public forum?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2429.523,2432.693,We don't believe it's essential that the Court determine that it is a limited public forum.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.454,2470.827,"Well, I thought what they suggest was that this is in the interest of labor peace."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2470.827,2471.841,They suggested that--
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2471.841,2473.904,"That's certainly a state interest, isn't it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2473.904,2475.638,"--It certainly is, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.877,2518.401,"Well, the federal contract bar rule for a period of whatever it is now is certainly imposed just across the board, without regard to whether there might be disharmony or friction in that particular employment situation."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2534.178,2537.286,--I think the school board and the state... strike that.
1982.81-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2566.524,2572.928,"Mr. Zweig, there is contrary authority to your position, is there not?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2572.928,2574.8,"Yes, in the lower courts."
1982.81-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2574.8,2577.206,Including two Courts of Appeals.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2577.206,2577.986,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2577.986,2581.987,Do you cite those cases and try to distinguish them at all?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2581.987,2584.299,We think those cases are simply wrong.
1982.81-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2586.748,2588.264,But you don't even say that in your brief.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2589.481,2593.182,We do not cite those cases in our brief.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2617.768,2632.263,"I take it if your union has access to the system it would use it, in large part at least, to point out the deficiencies in the representation by the PEA, would it not?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2632.263,2635.823,That might be one purpose for which we'd put the system.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.823,2637.932,What else would you use it for?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2637.932,2649.584,"We might also use the system to communicate our ideas about issues that come up in the day to day operations of the schools, whether it be with respect to--"
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2649.584,2657.999,"Well, I take it what you want to persuade the teacher constituency is that you'd be a better representative of theirs than is PEA; would you not?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2657.999,2658.752,--In part.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2661.547,2667.452,"That would certainly set up a not too pleasant atmosphere for the school board, would it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2667.452,2671.855,"--We don't believe that it would, and we base that upon the facts of this case."
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.349,2693.27,There was no exclusive representative during that period?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2693.27,2698.313,"There was an exclusive representative during that period, and that exclusive representative was PEA."
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2698.313,2702.2,"Well, one way to stop it would be not to let either one use it."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2702.2,2703.078,We believe--
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2703.078,2704.295,"And that would be legal, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2704.295,2705.125,--Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.091,2715.042,And that's what it does during the campaigning--
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2715.042,2717.073,That is what it does during the campaign.
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.073,2718.29,--during the campaigning period.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2718.29,2726.88,"Contrary to what my opposing counsel has indicated, during the period of the campaign both groups are denied access."
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.88,2729.427,That's on page 20 and 21 of the appendix.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2729.427,2730.066,That's right.
1982.81-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2757.898,2772.219,"Mr. Zweig, as I understand your argument, though, you urge that there was a public forum created by virtue of the action in letting the Y and the Boy Scouts and so forth use it."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2781.778,2784.574,That is true.
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.7,2869.525,"Well, your outfit could certainly mail to the teachers who are represented by your opposing labor group its views at their home address, couldn't it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2869.525,2871.493,"It could do that, but there are two problems with that."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.493,2872.975,Treated as junk mail?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2872.975,2873.993,Pardon?
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2873.993,2875.803,Might it be treated as junk mail?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2875.803,2876.883,I don't believe so.
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.077,2895.498,When is that critical period of time?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2895.498,2897.125,--Early on during the school year.
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.125,2898.622,Why is that critical?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2898.622,2905.758,"Because when new teachers come in we would like to have the opportunity to speak with them, to talk about the issues which are presented to the school system."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2905.758,2907.494,To kind of organize them in a way?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2907.494,2914.038,"In a way, to at least give a contrary point of view to that being expressed by the majority union."
1982.81-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2946.025,2967.375,"Mr. Zweig, in the USPS versus Council of Greenburgh case, the Court held that the United States mail system did not require us to have a compelling state interest test applied to any restrictions placed on the use of the U.S. mails."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,2971.406,2984.244,"We think it's different because the private mailboxes which each of us has in our home are not, in terms of the court, a public forum."
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3025.711,3034.848,"Did I understand you to say that if you prevail here, the school board would be at liberty to deny both unions access to this?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3034.848,3038.222,We think that the school board can deny both.
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.222,3045.358,Even though it continues to permit the Boy Scouts and these others that are allowed to use it to use it.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3045.358,3053.076,"Given the entrance of other people, other outside organizations and individuals to the system, based on that we would say we should have the same access."
1982.81-896,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3053.076,3060.336,"So that what you're saying is if you prevail, if the board is to exercise the option of closing down the system, it will have to close it to everybody."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3060.336,3061.163,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3064.613,3070.487,May I ask whether the school board members are elected by the public?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3070.487,3071.567,"Yes, they are."
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3071.567,3085.122,Is there anything in the bargaining agreement that would prevent the union from taking a position of favoring or disfavoring a candidate for election to the school board?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3085.122,3085.718,No.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3094.652,3095.541,It's silent?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3095.541,3096.259,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3096.259,3099.898,So at least in theory the union could take a position?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3099.898,3104.272,In theory the contract doesn't prohibit them from taking that position.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3104.272,3110.581,Did the school board participate in this case at the district court level?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3110.581,3120.891,"The school board did participate at the district court level, and they did participate in the Court of Appeals to the extent that they essentially joined in the position taken by PEA."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.868,3144.144,Would you take the same position if the school board denied use to all organizations except PEA?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3144.144,3145.552,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.646,3159.859,"You mean letting... if the school board thinks it's got a good reason to let its collective bargaining representative communicate with its teachers, so it lets that organization and that organization alone communicate with the teachers."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3162.546,3179.88,"--We believe that because of the nature of the communications within that system, which are largely political, that... and we base that upon Abood and the City of Madison cases, as well as what is articulated under Indiana law as the subjects of bargaining and discussion."
1982.81-896,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.301,3192.798,"Well, did you get any schoolteachers to join you in this suit?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3192.798,3199.311,--We do not have any schoolteachers other than those who are represented by the Perry Local Educators' Association.
1982.81-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.311,3202.153,May I ask a question about your opponent's argument?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3217.132,3230.737,"Again, we would articulate that to the extent that the system is used for political purposes, we should have the same opportunity to speak on those political issues as anybody else."
1982.81-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.107,3240.17,"Well, I understand you are arguing it's a public forum."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3240.17,3240.7,--Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.7,3252.196,"Are you arguing separately, as I understood the Court of Appeals to hold, which is quite different from the argument, that even if it's not a public forum, you nevertheless are entitled to prevail under some neutrality approach?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3252.196,3252.898,Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.741,3259.882,And you think that position survives the Postal Service case--
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3259.882,3260.771,--Yes.
1982.81-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.66,3266.706,"--Greenberg, yes."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3266.706,3290.212,"--The Court made a strong point of the fact that the mailboxes there and generally in the country are not open to selected groups to use; that is to say, the Postal Service doesn't attempt to distinguish between individuals and organizations who may gain access to their private box and exclude some and grant access to others."
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3298.117,3304.004,"Counsel, I understood you to say earlier that you perceive this to be a limited public forum."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3312.923,3315.59,We are claiming it is a limited public forum.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3315.59,3317.419,"Well, I think you should make that clear."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3319.185,3320.371,This is not like a street.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3322.168,3327.164,"It is not even like the university in the Widmar case we had here last term, is it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3327.164,3329.82,--We think it's similar to the Widmar case.
1982.81-896,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3329.82,3335.006,But there were over a hundred organizations allowed to use the building in that case.
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3335.006,3340.957,But in this case there is no evidence that anybody other than PLEA has been excluded.
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.484,3349.235,"Well, you have to be careful with ""excluded""."
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3351.235,3354.968,--We are not familiar with any group which has asked to gain entrance--
1982.81-896,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3354.968,3357.183,"Well, that doesn't mean excluded, does it?"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3361.168,3381.083,"--During the course of the proceedings in the trial court we attempted through discovery to determine who had been granted access and who had been denied access and a number of other issues; but our discovery was cut off on a motion filed by the appellants in this case, and so we didn't have an opportunity to develop that particular point."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.083,3382.783,Did you win or lose in the district court?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3382.783,3383.894,We lost in the district court.
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.894,3387.236,Did you raise the lack of discovery as an issue on appeal?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3387.236,3388.016,"Yes, we did."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.016,3389.498,Did the Court of Appeals pass on it?
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3389.498,3390.359,"No, it did not."
1982.81-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.263,3408.087,"You really couldn't urge that as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I suppose, because if it were found that the discovery were inadequate, it wouldn't be an affirmance, and the judge would send it back--"
1982.81-896,1,40851,richard_l_zweig,,3408.087,3409.319,That's correct.
1982.81-896,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.175,3534.786,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1982.81-896,2,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3568.145,3569.221,0 [Nothing.]
