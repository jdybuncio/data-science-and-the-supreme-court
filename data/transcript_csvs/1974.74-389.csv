1974.74-389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.705,692.21,Are their fewer in number in each classification as you go up with?
1974.74-389,0,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,692.21,694.364,"No, sir."
1974.74-389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.958,716.315,"So, there's many machine tenders on each shift as there are spare hands number four."

1974.74-389,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1047.863,1049.398,Have you given the signal?
1974.74-389,0,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,1050.733,1056.809,"Well, I really haven't gotten then to the argument?"
1974.74-389,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.841,1089.196,Mr. Woods.

1974.74-389,1,46552,warren_woods,,1771.629,1773.865,"Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina."
1974.74-389,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1773.865,1778.035,"Now, that's -- so it's not anywhere to Virginia?"
1974.74-389,1,46552,warren_woods,,1778.035,1779.979,"Not Roanoke, Virginia, Your Honor."
1974.74-389,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1779.979,1782.474,Right.
1974.74-389,1,46552,warren_woods,,1784.29,1789.25,That is the North Central part of North Carolina.
1974.74-389,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.015,1862.12,"Very well, Mr. Woods."
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,1863.887,1869.464,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.874,2190.266,Mr. Chambers why are these papers if you can tell me we are not taking any of inconvenience are the commission's guidelines?
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2190.266,2209.046,"They are in the appendix, in volume 2 of the appendix, I think beginning on page 305."
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.046,2214.586,And these were promulgated before or after this Court's decision in the Griggs case?
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2214.586,2216.59,Before this Court's decision in Griggs case.
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.59,2217.237,Before?
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2217.237,2219.041,Yes.
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2222.524,2224.111,'71.
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2226.774,2232.421,Moving then to the question of backpay.
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.053,2652.588,"What do -- most characterizes the labor board decisions is the difference of the Courts will get to the board itself and in working out what might be an adequate remedy in a particular case, wouldn't that be fair to say?"
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2652.588,2662.627,I would -- that's correct Your Honor but still the Court are requires that that the discretion be exercised with the view toward there enforcing the Act.
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2662.627,2680.579,"Here the -- if the same attitude that the -- that seems to pretty much provide the decisions in the Labor Act cases where to be reflected in this case, wouldn't their be there more deference given to the -- what the District Court did in this case?"
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2680.579,2683.132,"Not unless -- no, I don't think so."
1974.74-389,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.68,2734.284,Are there any labor board decisions that say that the board must as a general rule were backpay and not this only under special circumstances?
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2734.284,2753.77,We think that the decision we cite in Phelps Dodge Corporation which has been cited interestingly by all parties clearly holds that the quality of board has discretion it must exercise that discretion with the view toward the purpose of the Congress in the Act.
1974.74-389,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.77,2759.359,"But Congress didn't say in the Act, you will award backpay period."
1974.74-389,2,29595,j_levonne_chambers,,2765.614,2779.053,"Congress did not say that you must award backpay in language in the Act but we think that in the legislative history in 1972, the intent of Congress to make the victim hold is clear."
1974.74-389,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.71,3165.911,Very well Mr. Chambers.
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3167.396,3173.214,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.643,3605.002,"In making its exercising, its discretion in the District Court, was it -- whether it had been appropriate for the District Court to take into account the efforts of the employer to provide training courses and to take new steps after 1964 and again after 1968, try to meet these problems?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3605.002,3615.061,I think that would be a proper subject for the District Court to address as you indicated in the Griggs opinion Your Honor.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.194,3655.538,"Well, in Griggs the employer had not abandoned the high school diploma requirement as they had here, is that not correct?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3655.538,3661.883,"I believe the high school diploma requirement was still in this case at the time of trial too, Your Honor."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3665.376,3669.063,When was the high school diploma requirement abandoned in this case?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3669.063,3692.17,"In this case, the District Court's order said that since the Wonderlic test were substantially an equivalent of high school measure that he did not reach the question of the validation effort that had been made as to high school examination or high school diplomas and he was enjoining their continued views."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3692.17,3715.918,Do you have any comment to make about the general statement which I do not associate with any particular figures that there was very little response by employees to the training program developed by the union and the company jointly?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3715.918,3727.178,Studied the record only and that's the limit of my experience in this case Your Honor and I've -- I don't recall any statistics in the record as to the participation.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3734.592,3745.379,Would that be an appropriate factor for the district judge to take into account in exercising his discretion about backpay?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3745.379,3754.971,"I should think so, yes, Your Honor but the -- we also think that a Court faced with such a question."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3790.333,3802.863,And you concede I take it that this is not quite a simple matter in determining a violation of laws as it is in some other areas as?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3802.863,3821.085,"Oh, I think that's right Your Honor, the record here is quite lengthy and quite detailed as to the way Title VII was applied and how effective be the seniority system and how the lines of progression had to be merged because there were segregated."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3849.756,3852.516,We resume there after lunch Mr. Turner.
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3852.516,3860.366,Thank you.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3860.366,3864.406,"Mr. Turner, you may continue."
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3864.406,3868.206,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.74-389,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3919.678,3928.547,"But the Court of Appeals didn't just remanded the District Court for perhaps additional consideration in itself directed the award of backpay, didn't it?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3928.547,3943.077,"Well, that Mr. Justice could not happen as a practical matter unless there were some additional proceedings in the District Court that backpay amounts had not been determined and the identities of who would be entitled to it, had not been determined yet."
1974.74-389,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3943.077,3956.345,But the District Court's discretion is to whether or not there was to be backpay if the loss were made out has been taken away by the Court of Appeals.
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3956.345,3966.831,I think the standard that the Court of Appeals used in the correct one is to look to the purposes of the law that make whole purposes.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3987.371,3994.125,Did the Court of Appeals in terms before that the district judge had abused his discretion?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,3994.125,3997.288,"Not in so many terms -- in so many words Your Honor, no."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3997.288,4001.909,Isn't that the way it's ordinarily done when there's --
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4001.909,4002.396,"Well, if --"
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4002.396,4005.779,-- discretion involved in?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4005.779,4008.567,If you want it to phrased it that way.
1974.74-389,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4035.946,4050.15,"Well, rather of you say that the Court of Appeals really held the District Court heard cannot exercise in its discretion accordingly to the make whole standard, when you say that."
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4050.15,4051.755,That -- that would be our formulation as this --
1974.74-389,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4051.755,4059.892,"If that so, I gather the remand would be an exercise his discretion accordingly to make whole standard, wouldn't you?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4059.892,4060.878,That's correct.
1974.74-389,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4060.878,4062.654,"Well, Isn't that what the remand is?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4062.654,4077.595,There is no remand stated in the Court of Appeals opinion of as I indicated an answer to Justice Rehnquist to -- there has to be additional proceedings before any of backpay can be awarded.
1974.74-389,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4083.493,4091.816,But doesn't the Court of Appeals foreclose an independent determination by the District Court according to the correct standard might whole.
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4091.816,4114.649,"Oh, I think not, the -- now, as we read the Court of Appeals' opinion what they were saying was that normally unless there's some reason not to, a class of victims of racial discrimination will be entitled to be made whole for any economic loss they suffered."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4125.685,4129.444,"This is essentially on accounting process so, it is not?"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4129.444,4129.765,"Oh, I think --"
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4129.765,4132.337,The only thing remains to be done?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4132.337,4146.956,"I think that's not entirely true now, we've indicated in the brief that reliance on female protective legislation for example might be a basis for some discretion."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4162.804,4181.689,Would the district judge be free in your view to make inquiry and whether or not a particular claimants had taken an advantage of the union company's joint training program and put that in the scales against its recovery?
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4181.689,4185.92,"Well, if that's where it belong in the scales, yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4186.437,4189.718,"Well, I thought you've said earlier that it did belong there, before --"
1974.74-389,3,33206,james_p_turner,,4189.718,4191.981,I've said it was relevant now.
1974.74-389,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4314.414,4319.163,Thank you Mr. Turner.
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4328.807,4329.933,Thank you sir.
1974.74-389,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4451.606,4461.623,Do these comments Mr. Lowden have any effect on the validity of the guidelines insofar as they are promulgations of the EEOC?
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4461.623,4492.654,"I think that the new guidelines are supposed to have relax the old ones and so we -- they're talking about the new proposal in which I suppose I have relaxed some of the requirements of the other guidelines and one witness of that hearing was quoted in the BNA as saying that they are just irrational, unreasonable, and impossible."
1974.74-389,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4804.511,4807.495,-- conducting this matter is a class action at all?
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4807.495,4808.833,Yes sir.
1974.74-389,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4858.625,4862.525,But the class had been designated?
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4862.525,4863.902,"Well, --"
1974.74-389,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4863.902,4866.905,And then -- and there hadn't been certification at that?
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4866.905,4870.985,"He asked that The class was described by Judge Dupree, where this case --"
1974.74-389,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4870.985,4873.987,Judge Dupree didn't describe that until 71?
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4873.987,4891.298,"Well, but the way these cases go in the District Court they say, “We'll treat it as a class action for purposes of discovery and have get through all of that business, then will come back and describe what the class is in a by what that shows up.”"
1974.74-389,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4895.487,4918.011,"I notice at page 46 of the appendix that Judge Dupree in -- on June of 71 ordered the plaintiffs to make a more specific answer to an interrogatory you've submitted as to the claims of the damages, did the -- did the plaintiffs ultimately comply with that order?"
1974.74-389,4,24252,francis_v_lowden_jr,,4918.011,4919.795,"We claim they did not, they claim they did."
1974.74-389,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4982.159,4983.546,"Thank you, Mr. Lowden."
