1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,39.098,41.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.935,215.351,At Fort Lauderdale?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,215.351,216.734,"That would be Fort Lauderdale, yes sir."
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.734,223.935,Is Fort Lauderdale -- does Fort Lauderdale have a large newspaper of its own or does it tend to rely on the Miami newspaper?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,223.935,225.837,There is several newspapers in Fort Lauderdale.
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.77,248.696,Does it -- does it had state wide circulation?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,248.696,256.12,"Yes sir, to a degree -- to a lesser degree than in the Southern Counties."
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.56,287.426,The same robbery?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,287.426,288.921,"Same robbery case, new information."
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.921,292.498,And he'd been earlier held to be incompetent to defend?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,292.498,293.015,That is correct sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.015,295.939,And then the -- did that ruling get reversed somewhere along the line?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,295.939,296.95,Somewhere along the way.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.9,321.737,And this was a different judge from the judge who'd earlier found him incompetent?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,321.737,322.172,No sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.172,322.229,Same judge?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,322.229,328.742,"This is the same judge, Judge Colin Steadman was the same judge throughout that period of time."
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.387,392.9,"Now, the theft or the alleged theft of the Star of India jewel from New York had occurred good many years before the --"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,392.9,395.239,I believe either four or five years prior to the trial.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.239,398.127,Back in 1964 maybe?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,398.127,400.342,That is correct.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.342,403.065,And the murder conviction had occurred how long before the --
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,403.065,405.701,17 months prior to the trial of this case.
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.701,405.791,17 months earlier?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,405.791,407.287,"He was convicted, yes sir."
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,407.287,408.164,17 months.
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,408.164,408.633,That's correct.
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.633,431.129,"Mr. Swickle, I notice in Judge Atkins opinion, the district judge in denying habeas corpus at page 40 of the appendix said, “prior to his involvement of the crime which is the subject of this petition, Murphy had focused nationwide attention on himself for his role in the 1964 theft at the Star of India Sapphire.”"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,443.524,444.73,I think it would make a difference.
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.536,474.512,"That one -- one reading you can give to Judge Atkins’ finding, it certainly isn't the only --"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,474.512,480.124,"Well, except that there is nothing in the record, if Your Honor please, to support any other determination."
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,503.985,507.503,"He did get the name Murph the Surf from himself, didn't he?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,507.503,512.664,The name Murph the Surf originally came from the fact that he was to Surfer on Miami beach and did shows.
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,512.664,513.895,"He liked that name, didn't he?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,513.895,514.015,Oh!
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.953,518.722,"Well, that's the name that got him with the Star of India?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,518.722,519.429,Yes sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.429,521.573,So he had a little bit to do with it himself?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,521.573,525.342,"Well, this is the name that was attributed to him, he didn't publish his name as Murph the Surf."
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.342,527.768,I suppose that he enjoyed it?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,527.768,531.652,"Oh, I won't dispute the fact that there was recognition to some degree."
1974.74-5116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.652,533.152,[Voice Overlap]
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,533.152,538.704,"But I don't feel that with regards to that recognition, it's something he went out and solicited with regards to the Star of India."
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.727,588.454,In spite of the statewide circulation of the Miami Herald?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,588.454,590.449,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.809,600.226,May I ask you this question?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,613.502,614.75,"Yes sir, it is."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.75,615.582,Is that what the whole case is all about?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,615.582,617.906,"That's the crux of the case, yes sir."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.718,629.871,The question Marshall is previous supervisor?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,629.871,630.482,That's correct.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,630.482,631.571,It said so in --
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,631.571,633.564,"Yes sir, yes sir and it's been ruled upon it."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.704,641.944,Is that the same conflict because of -- that's the one Sheppard and --
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,641.944,642.472,That's right.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,642.579,642.945,Irvin and Dowd?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,642.945,645.706,-- interpretation of Sheppard and Irvin versus Dowd.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,645.706,647.975,"That we had made it, Marshall constitution?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,647.975,649.756,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.756,650.694,[Inaudible]
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,650.694,660.213,That's correct and I would point out additionally that and -- we did argue this in the brief with regards to the Duncan versus Louisiana.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,693.536,696.625,"Supervisors are very, very difficult in the constitution?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,696.625,697.157,"Yes sir, I'm aware of that."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.157,699.987,But Marshall was not a Sixth Amendment case?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,699.987,701.597,"Well, Marshall ruled --"
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.597,703.295,Marshall ruled under supervisor --
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,703.295,715.622,"That's correct, and ruled that the defendant's right to a fair trial as guaranteed to a federal prisoner under the Sixth Amendment was violated because of what came before the Court."
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,738.431,744.105,So I gather that you now argue is we should accept the Third Circuit's analysis in Duncan?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,744.105,747.707,"That's correct, that is correct."
1974.74-5116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,808.465,810.836,You mean constitutional reversal?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,810.836,811.196,Yes sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.196,812.16,By a totality?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,812.16,813.956,"Totality of circumstances, yes sir."
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.678,927.294,Did you -- did you raise this point in your Florida proceedings?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,927.294,927.368,Yes sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.368,928.388,And in your request for habeas corpus?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,928.388,929.127,Yes sir.
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.775,1033.69,Well they can -- have been dismissed for a cause those three I take it since they didn't -- the time they were challenged for cause they didn't know?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1033.69,1036.218,"No, at the time they were challenged of cause they didn't know."
1974.74-5116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.59,1043.213,"Well, you're not -- you're not talking about the deliberation, you're talking about the place where the jury waits to be chosen?"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1043.213,1043.94,Yes.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1052.648,1056.741,"Well, isn't known to you we haven't said, we first learned about this --"
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1056.741,1057.42,Yap.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.42,1058.575,-- to the other members of the panel --
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1058.575,1058.959,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1058.959,1059.353,-- is that it?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1059.353,1059.88,That is correct.
1974.74-5116,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.171,1063.837,And were they challenged for cause?
1974.74-5116,0,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,1063.837,1066.425,"All the jurors were challenged for cause, each and every juror."
1974.74-5116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1066.425,1083.049,"Mr. Swickle, would you tell me which of the names appearing in the index and whose voir dire and colloquy appears in the appendix, which of those actually served, there were six regular jurors and --"

1974.74-5116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.219,1396.04,But have we ever had a change where the jurors while waiting for the trial all together had a trial all of their own?
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1396.04,1400.425,"Your Honor, I believe that that is not the case that this record shows."
1974.74-5116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.425,1407.315,"Well, he said that every -- every juror testified that they'd heard discussions in that room?"

1974.74-5116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1445.307,1450.551,That's two.

1974.74-5116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1531.708,1532.645,But it was in the courtroom?
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1532.645,1533.04,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-5116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.04,1535.005,And there were least spectators?
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1535.005,1562.791,"Yes Your Honor that's correct and I would point out that the procedure which the trial judge then used was to examine these jurors, and allow counsel to examine the jurors and then upon counsel reaching a tentative agreement as to whether a juror would be selected to serve, each tentative juror was personally instructed by the trial judge at length as to what his conduct should be while awaiting trial, as to what he should avoid reading, as to what influences he should avoid exposing himself to."

1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1643.261,1647.384,"The defendants used all the peremptories, yes Your Honor there’s no question about that."
1974.74-5116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1661.358,1666.561,The juror that said what I heard about this case made me vomit?
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1666.561,1671.155,"The full quotation is enlightening Your Honor, I don't have the passage before me."
1974.74-5116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.155,1672.296,Oh sure.
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1672.296,1692.033,But the reason that he said it was because he said that he had such a strong adherence to constitutional safeguards that this concept made him sick and it was on this basis that we submit that he had a very reasonable assurance that he gave to the trial judge that he would be in fact a qualified juror and would not consider any extraneous influences.
1974.74-5116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1841.077,1848.913,"Mr. Rogers, do you tie that in to the change of venue for the other co-defendants?"
1974.74-5116,1,46065,william_l_rogers,,1848.913,1867.312,"Yes Your Honor, I would point out two factors regarding that change of venue on a separate federal crime that is that one, the declaration that by this defendant that he was guilty and was a co defendant with the others would necessitate that the federal judge change the venue for that particular crime."
1974.74-5116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2157.447,2159.411,Do you have anything further Mr. Swickle?
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2159.411,2164.014,"Yes Your Honor, just very briefly."
1974.74-5116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2262.194,2268.013,Do you -- are you suggesting that that's just to -- those concepts are not compatible?
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2268.013,2281.094,"No, I am suggesting on the talking about motive and the jurors testimony, we seem to have a situation where the jurors, some of the jurors who sat in this case, who sat in the jury room for three days came out and said they heard no discussion of this case."
1974.74-5116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2281.094,2282.117,"Oh, it's a big room you say --"
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2282.117,2283.113,No sir.
1974.74-5116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.113,2286.429,A hundred people in it so it's got to be a fairly big room.
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2286.429,2299.372,The discussions of the -- from all of these jurors with anybody sitting in that room would have heard discussions regarding this case judge -- Your Honor and I say that -- I say that because unfortunately I was there so I know.
1974.74-5116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2299.808,2301.965,Is it to show the size of the room since --
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2301.965,2304.664,"No sir it doesn't, but the record --"
1974.74-5116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.664,2310.599,It can't be a very small room if it held a hundred jurors waiting to be called in?
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2310.599,2311.841,"Well, it also point out that the record --"
1974.74-5116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2311.841,2313.567,Were you in that jury room?
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2313.567,2317.645,"I -- no sir, I was there at the trial, now, I wasn't in the jury room."
1974.74-5116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2321.79,2325.965,"Incidentally, Murph the Surf's reputation was wide open?"
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2325.965,2326.792,I'm sorry?
1974.74-5116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.792,2330.184,"Murph the Surf's reputation was was what, a glamor figure or --"
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2330.184,2344.472,"Originally, he was a surfer and he gained notoriety as a surfer, as a concert violinist and then the first criminal activity which the notoriety was gained was -- excuse me, the Star of India."
1974.74-5116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.472,2347.057,"Well, isn't that the one that became a motion picture or something?"
1974.74-5116,2,28149,harvey_s_swickle,,2347.057,2347.994,"Eventually, yes."

1974.74-5116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.305,2394.921,[Inaudible] on this particular charge?
