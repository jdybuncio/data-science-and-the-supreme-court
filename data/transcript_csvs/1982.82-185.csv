1982.82-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.855,"We will hear arguments next in Boston Firefighters against Castro, Beecher, and all."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,83.889,84.701,Thank you.
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.108,202.09,"Mr. Barnico, were those original orders entered of indefinite duration?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,202.09,213.587,"The orders that were entered in August of 1981, Your Honor, or the--"
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.587,216.257,"No, the original... sometime in the '70's."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,217.178,237.904,--The subsequent decrees entered shortly after those original findings to provide for the remedial phase of the cases applied to the cities and towns until the percentages of minorities reach a percentage commensurate with the percentage in the community.
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.904,239.967,"And, has that percentage yet been reached?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,239.967,242.996,"Not in Boston, Your Honor, but in many communities, yes."
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.996,250.602,"So, as far as Boston is concerned, the decree entered in the '70's still has considerable prospective effect?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,250.602,251.321,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.676,279.607,"Should the order that we are reviewing here today, having to do with the layoffs, be interpreted as having a permanent effect in your view?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,279.607,281.824,"Our view... That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.974,308.58,Hasn't there been some recent legislation requiring the reinstatement of all those firemen and policemen who were laid off?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,308.58,311.328,"--Yes, Your Honor, that legislation was passed in June of 1982."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.328,314.437,"Well, then, what kind of case have we got here?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,314.437,315.624,"You have a live case here, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.624,315.999,How?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,315.999,319.513,These cases--
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.513,322.153,"Everyone who was aggrieved has now been reinstated, hasn't he?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,322.153,325.651,--The state is aggrieved and--
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,325.651,331.337,"Everyone who has been aggrieved, every fireman and police officer has been reinstated, has he not?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,331.337,341.584,"--The firefighters and police officers laid off in the summer of 1981 were reinstated by the terms of that legislation, that is correct."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.584,343.847,"I ask you again then, what kind of a case do we have here?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,344.566,353.92,"We have a live case here, Your Honor, because the state defendants have been parties to this case for over ten years, are still subject to the outstanding terms of those orders."
1982.82-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.92,356.498,Do you mean on back pay?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,356.498,357.404,Excuse me?
1982.82-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.404,360.996,Do you mean by reason of back pay that is paid to these people?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,360.996,363.48,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.163,383.38,"What orders are you talking about, reinstatement and seniority or what?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,384.13,392.548,"The orders of August 7, 1981, by their terms apply to any program for reduction in force."
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.069,428.317,The parties have had to comply with the reduction-in-force orders.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,428.317,434.392,--I am not sure what you mean by that.
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.392,443.545,"Well, the issue in the case was how were they going to discharge people when they reduced force?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,443.545,444.186,That is correct.
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.307,454.072,And the orders were that they wouldn't govern them.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,454.072,463.693,--The orders said that the statute would be ignored and percentages... any program of reduction in force should be maintained.
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.693,467.974,And the police and fire department have been complying with those?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,467.974,468.927,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.927,471.035,And they must continue to comply--
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,471.035,471.722,Absolutely.
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.722,473.189,--Unless the orders are set aside?
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,473.189,474.314,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.314,475.127,"Well, I don't follow that."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,493.525,501.975,"As I said, Your Honor, there is a current effect on the Civil Service Commission's adjudication of their appeals."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,501.975,504.302,"Well, what is left of their appeals?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,510.66,511.861,That is right.
1982.82-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.861,512.642,And seniority.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,518.39,522.311,"Back pay is not an issue in this case, no, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.311,524.373,But neither is seniority.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,527.761,530.901,The controversy continues for those reasons that I gave earlier.
1982.82-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.165,535.414,"And the reinstatement included too with full seniority, isn't it?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,540.458,541.833,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.833,542.521,"Oh, isn't it?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,542.521,546.675,"Your Honor, these cases--"
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.675,548.082,"Well, if not, what?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,552.923,557.484,--Seniority only to the time of determination.
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.451,563.31,You don't seem to be too sure of that.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,563.31,579.115,"--Well, Mr. McMahon, I think, could clarify that position, but the back pay issue still remains so that when Justice Stevens suggested that all issues were taken care by the reinstatement, I add that the back pay question still remains."
1982.82-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.115,584.739,"I assume, since you represent the state, your denying that they are entitled to back pay and he contends they are entitled to back pay."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,584.739,586.441,"The state is an adjudicator actually, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.441,587.112,"Oh, I see."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,587.112,592.236,The Commission will decide whether the city will actually pay the back pay.
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.016,608.401,"The city under the... or rather the Civil Service Commission under the modification of 1981 is subject to an express paragraph, is it not, of the modification limiting the authority of the Civil Service Commission?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,608.401,615.21,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that continuing effect keeps this case alive before this Court."
1982.82-185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.21,632.609,"The respondents contended, and some copy of a Civil Service Commission decision is attached, to indicated that our decision here will have no effect on the back pay and that is being resolved on different grounds."
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,632.609,644.761,"But, currently, Your Honor, the Civil Service Commission is prevented from even considering the question of seniority in the back pay and termination appeals."
1982.82-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,656.32,665.317,"Yes, but Mr. Barnico, if we were to conclude that the case is moot because of these reinstatements, I take it we would vacate all those orders, wouldn't we?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,665.317,678.985,"But, you would have to conclude that there is no continuing and permanent effect on the state petitioners before you vacate these orders, vacate this case and instruct to dismiss."
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.01,695.039,"Well, I take it we would have to vacate the entire decree if it is moot, wouldn't we?"
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,695.039,696.539,Absolutely.
1982.82-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.539,697.726,Including the 1970 portion.
1982.82-185,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,697.726,707.332,And that procedure that has been used in the past has often been used to vacate the underlying judgments with instructions to dismiss which is far different than here.
1982.82-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,854.961,857.57,Mr. McMahon?
1982.82-185,1,31663,john_mc_mahon,,857.57,859.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-185,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.659,1107.796,"Mr. McMahon, what is your theory on how 703(h) gets into this case since the action wasn't brought under Title VII?"
1982.82-185,1,31663,john_mc_mahon,,1107.796,1109.39,"Your Honor, there were two actions."
1982.82-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1510.212,1516.366,Mr. Dittmar?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1516.366,1522.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-185,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.664,1593.928,"You said ""rehiring""."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1594.538,1595.522,Additional hiring.
1982.82-185,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.176,1604.128,"--While you are there, what did they do about the back pay of these men who were laid off?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1604.128,1610.968,"The back pay is now, to my understanding, in some instances pending before the Civil Service Commission."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.788,1636.302,"Mr. Dittmar, wouldn't you say that the state could represent the Civil Service Commissioners?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1636.302,1641.925,The state could represent the Civil Service Commissioners but they sit as an adjudicator party.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.925,1645.861,"But, they are subject to paragraph four of Judge Caffrey's decree, are they not?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1645.861,1658.902,"Paragraph four of Judge Caffrey's decree has, for all intents and purposes, has expired, because there are no longer any terminations or layoffs with which the Civil Service officials could in any way interfere by any action that they take."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.366,1679.284,"But, what if this judgment is reversed, that that level of force order is invalidated?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1691.405,1705.992,I don't see how the Civil Service Commission could deny a back-pay claim because an order which was valid and not reversed nor vacated at the time it was in effect is subsequently reversed on appeal.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.909,1735.7,"Mr. Dittmar, do you know of any case similar to this where there has been an underlying controversy that is the subject of a basic decree and then there is a modification of the decree and we have simply said, well, this branch of the case is moot but the underlying controversy isn't?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1735.7,1739.668,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.416,1742.041,You ask Mr. Carpenter.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1742.041,1746.741,"--I believe all of the cases in which a corollary... Excuse me, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.741,1748.272,Allow me to finish my question.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1748.272,1748.959,Sure.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.959,1760.346,"You are really asking us to go into kind of a new departure, aren't you, where the basic underlying case is not moot, to simply prune off a little branch of it and say, because it is moot, the whole thing is vacated?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1760.346,1761.485,"No, quite the contrary."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.559,1782.165,"Yes, but the underlying controversy is whether there should be a minority quota requirement in the Boston policy and fire systems, isn't there?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1782.165,1783.306,That has been resolved by the statute.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.306,1789.787,"Well, that has been resolved by the District Court decree in the '70's."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1789.787,1793.769,"Well, as between... I am sorry, in the '70's, no, not in the '70's."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.769,1796.893,"Well, when was the original decree entered?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1796.893,1814.339,"The original decrees, the original decrees were in the early '70's, that is true, but those decrees terminate by their own terms once any hiring authority achieves a percentage representation of firefighters or police officers."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.339,1820.118,Opposing counsel said that that decree had not terminated so far as the City of Boston was concerned.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1820.118,1822.259,"That is correct, but that decree is not before this Court."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.287,1831.488,"If that is a live controversy, any modification of it is a live controversy isn't it?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1831.488,1833.597,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.448,1861.525,"Well, but, we decide mootness in terms of cases or controversies, not in terms of orders."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1861.525,1863.96,You decide it in terms of... That is true.
1982.82-185,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.07,1913.221,"But, according to the petitioners, it is a permanent order and any future action by the city or those governed by the order will have to be taken in conformity with it."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,1913.221,1914.563,I disagree with that.
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.948,2014.29,Was the legislation ordering reinstatement consistent with the Court's order?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2014.29,2024.879,The legislation ordering reinstatement had nothing to do with the Court's order except that it followed the Court's order.
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.879,2026.659,"I just ask you again, was it consistent with it?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2026.659,2029.315,Was it consistent with the Court's order?
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.315,2029.736,Yes.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2034.61,2044.434,"It lead to the same... It lead to a consistent result, that is true, in the sense that--"
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.434,2049.853,"Well, it ordered reinstatement of the very people that the Court thought should have been laid off."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2049.853,2051.259,"--No, no."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.727,2096.772,And the same ratio?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2096.772,2099.755,"I don't know whether it is in the same ratio, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.755,2100.567,That was my question.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2100.567,2102.832,I can't answer your question as--
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.832,2104.098,That is all I needed to know.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2104.941,2107.986,--I would like to turn to the merits of the case.
1982.82-185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.986,2110.205,May I ask just one question to be sure I understand?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2110.205,2110.924,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.924,2118.905,"Is it your position that you would be just as content to have the District Judge's order of August 7, 1981 vacated?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2118.905,2125.606,"Well, I suppose having put the suggestion of mootness into the brief, I would have to say, yes, we are just as content."
1982.82-185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.606,2125.872,I just wanted to be sure.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2125.872,2133.823,I think that is a matter of responsibility to the Court in laying out the full dimensions of the present circumstances to the Court.
1982.82-185,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2133.823,2139.946,"Well, you made the suggestion contemplating that if the suggestion were favorably received that is exactly what would happen."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2139.946,2140.663,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2140.663,2144.506,"But, no more stripping down, just that one order?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2144.506,2146.692,"Just that one order, that is correct."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.207,2149.738,"And, the rest of the case remains alive?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2149.738,2152.066,"--The rest of the case remains alive, that is correct."
1982.82-185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.907,2205.528,Do you think it would have been improper in the original decree for the District Judge to have included provisions dealing with the contingency of possible reductions in force?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2205.528,2217.321,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that it would have been beyond the Court's power to do so, but I believe that it would not have been a sound exercise in discretion."
1982.82-185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.321,2225.538,Why wouldn't he have power today to keep in effect a portion of the decree which would deal with that contingency even if we can't see it immediately before us?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2225.538,2268.285,"Because I think that in exercising discretion for remedial purposes to remedy the exclusion of minorities from public service a court should be very careful to consider the actual circumstances obtaining before it, to consider what extent of relief has been accorded under the on-going remedial program which is incomplete, how far along the remedy is, the extent of the imposition or the frustration of the remedy, which an otherwise proposed governmental action would work, the burden that any particular order would place upon third-party employees, and factors of that sort."
1982.82-185,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.98,2292.275,"If the case if not moot, now you are going to address the merits of the case, are you?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2292.275,2295.274,"If the case is not moot, I would like to address the merits, yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.093,2488.182,Could I ask you what seniority did the Blacks have or the minorities have when they were hired pursuant to the Court's order?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2490.229,2491.775,"They started out from scratch, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.775,2498.304,"So, they didn't... There was no attempt made to jump them over anybody else?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2498.304,2499.163,"Two things, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.619,2538.194,"So, at the time... So, when the layoffs started, the minorities that had been hired were certainly junior to a lot of other people?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2538.194,2539.381,That is correct.
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.381,2543.004,And junior to a lot of people who were then discharged pursuant to the order?
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2543.004,2544.145,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.737,2629.641,"When you say ""clearly identified at the outset"", what do you mean?"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2629.641,2638.701,--That would have been individuals who had taken and passed discriminatory examinations and who could be counted... whose noses could be counted so to speak.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.949,2641.636,"But, if they took and passed the examination--"
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2641.636,2643.432,--Took and failed the examination.
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.664,2657.88,"--But, you were making the argument on behalf of those that didn't, too."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2657.88,2678.433,"--What I am arguing for, Your Honor, is flexibility for the District Court in fashioning remedies to remedy the effects of long-standing exclusion of racial minorities from government service."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.433,2688.258,"And, you make that argument on behalf of all those who were hired, but whom you can't prove or you don't allege were themselves ever discriminated against."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2688.258,2692.586,"No, no, no, no."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.599,2699.021,Yes.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2699.021,2700.816,--themselves were victims of discrimination.
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.816,2710.389,I am just saying there are a lot of people who were hired pursuant to the Court's order that were never discriminated against themselves.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2710.389,2713.809,During the remedial phase--
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.809,2728.118,I don't suppose there would be much of a case here if you could show that all of these people were in that category of people who could have been given rightful place seniority when they were hired.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2728.118,2738.206,"--If what Your Honor is saying is that there was an element of the original remedial measures was an affirmative action type of order, that is the case."
1982.82-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.206,2738.831,"Yes, all right."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2738.831,2739.472,That is the case.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.906,2756.152,"Well, it is certainly before the Court in the sense that when we get to the merits of reviewing the District Court's injunction against firing."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2773.303,2775.037,Except that there is a great deal of complexity in this.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.692,2780.987,"Well, I think... I know as much about the complexity on that particular issue, I think, as I need to know."
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,2780.987,2797.871,--One of the issues here is that everyone who ultimately was hired had to take civil service examinations and these civil service examinations were never validated ever.
1982.82-185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.649,3095.582,What was the reason for paragraph four of Judge Caffrey's order where it says in the event that a police officer's appeal of his termination to the members of the Civil Service Commission challenges the method of termination set forth herein.
1982.82-185,2,30054,james_s_dittmar,,3103.374,3124.663,"The purpose of that provision, Your Honor, was to insure that as a matter of state civil service law, if there was compliance by the city with the order, the Civil Service Commission would not overturn that in such a fashion as to require the layoffs of minorities in contravention of the Court's order."
1982.82-185,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.726,3319.569,"Mr. Barnico, do you have anything further?"
1982.82-185,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3319.569,3321.864,No.
1982.82-185,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3321.989,3324.192,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
