1960.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,5.528,"Number 54, Carl Braden, Petitioner, versus the United States."
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,12.225,14.975,May it please the Court.
1960.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1178.438,1181.518,I -- I just saw it and I try to understand it.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1188.354,1189.525,That is correct sir.
1960.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.525,1190.365,Thank you.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1190.365,1197.98,And I may say Mr. Justice Stewart that it is interesting that not only does it appear there but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
1960.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1207.163,1208.192,Apparently thought what?
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1208.192,1218.805,"I thought it was important enough, critical enough to the conviction here of the defendant or the offender to the conviction to reproduce the letter itself on page 116 of the record."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1955.18,1958.965,Do we have to decide any of these questions in this case?
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1958.965,1960.962,"Well, I do not know, Your Honor."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1962.98,1963.745,"If you don't know, who would know?"
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1963.745,1975.322,"I think, Your Honor is -- it has to decide whether or not, the Committee had a legislative purpose or whether the questions are of the Barenblatt type or whether they fall within the character that I've indicated."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1975.322,1984.634,"In the Court of Appeals merely arrested the afferents on the propriety or the legality of that in one question, your conflict isn't that true?"
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1984.634,1991.195,"I am a little puzzled -- Your Honor, I'm a little puzzled as to whether the Court of Appeals relying upon one question, or four."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1991.195,1992.224,But they said so that the --
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1992.224,1994.357,"Well, that the opinion is somewhat ambiguous."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2019.786,2020.441,They do.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2039.122,2039.508,Well --
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2039.508,2055.132,"Stating of the appellant's conviction on any one of the counts would require an affirmance of concerns that were imposed and it is that count third, beginning with the bottom page 115 --"
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2055.132,2055.219,Well --
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2055.219,2056.467,Is that true?
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2056.467,2067.516,"They do discuss count 3 and I was going to indicate Your Honor that they do not discuss count 5 at all, the question of the signature to the letter, but either -- or the Southern Newsletter, but there is some --"
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2067.516,2071.338,They put all the other (Inaudible) as I read his opinion.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2071.338,2074.643,"Well, I think the opinion is ambiguous."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2090.953,2099.327,"While you make -- While you make of the explicit statement, we need not make any analysis of the pertinency of the questions upon which other counts to the indictment were based."
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2099.327,2100.33,"Well, but the question is whether --"
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2100.33,2105.446,That implies that they were merely concerned with some counts or counts that (Inaudible)
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2105.446,2106.643,Exactly.
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2107.017,2117.491,"And from page 159, it is such that one count, the third count and one question."
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2117.491,2128.955,"Well, the -- my only hesitation about exceeding to what is of course helpful to the petitioner here, is the ambiguity of that paragraph on page 118."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2137.231,2139.027,It's very important what you did.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2139.027,2142.584,"Yes, but I -- that's the problem on the Court of Appeals."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2249.934,2253.913,May I ask you whether this resolution is any different than the resolution that we've been considering?
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2253.913,2255.296,"-- it is exactly the same, Your Honor."
1960.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2255.296,2255.627,Alright.
1960.54,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2255.627,2268.515,"Finally, I come down to our last basic point which is the reliance of the witness explicitly upon this Court's opinion in Watkins case."
1960.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2603.93,2605.42,Mr. Yeagley.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2605.42,2621.671,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2653.275,2665.119,"Could you suppose of that at the beginning, what the Government's view is -- you say, at least one count, anyone, if it to anyone, then it must consider all five or other five counts, six counts?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2665.119,2666.244,-- There are five --
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2666.244,2670.305,"If you say anyone, then we -- when do we must consider all five."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2675.774,2675.892,As in that --
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2675.892,2678.022,What is the view of the Government?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2678.022,2690.442,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it is our view that count 5, is clearly proper, valid and sustainable."
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2716.496,2719.855,But count 5 was not -- was not relied on by the Court of Appeals?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2719.855,2722.609,"The Court of Appeals did not treat with count 5, very much at all."
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.609,2723.489,They were not discussed at all?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2723.489,2727.152,That's right.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2729.131,2736.64,Do you believe -- on what count do you think the Court of Appeals rested its (Inaudible)
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2736.64,2736.857,I think it --
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2736.857,2738.741,On what counts?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2738.741,2740.403,One and three.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2747.68,2749.266,One and three?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2749.266,2750.263,That's my recollection.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2750.263,2754.993,"You don't think, also four, being four of them."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2754.993,2767.657,I may have -- I -- I'm not going to insist on my own statement there because I -- I maybe wrong in the one and three.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2767.657,2768.357,"In any event, towards --"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2768.357,2768.501,My --
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.501,2770.527,It was not five by which the Government --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2770.527,2771.7,It was not five.
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2790.813,2812.426,"May I -- may I just refer to the question that -- that Justice Frankfurter propounded to counsel, do you consider -- you don't consider that everything is out of this case except, count 3 as a -- as Justice Frankfurter's reading of the decision implied."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2812.426,2813.479,"Well, I don't --"
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2813.479,2814.114,If I may briefly --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2814.114,2816.15,"Know that I understood his question, I --"
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2816.15,2816.398,That was my view.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2816.398,2820.696,-- but I can speak my own position is that we are not abandoning any of the counts.
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2826.203,2828.748,"Well of course, if you don't rely on just one count --"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2828.748,2829.51,Yes.
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2829.51,2835.797,"That counsel on the other side shouldn't have to -- to devote his attention to just one count either, should he?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2835.797,2845.336,"Right, oh well, he would have to -- he was -- his client was convicted on all five counts and he would have the burden of meeting that."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2845.336,2846.387,Yes.
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2846.387,2869.173,"But then I'd like to ask you one other question at the threshold, if you mainly rely on five and if the Court of Appeals didn't even consider five, then there arises in my mind, the question of whether the Court of Appeals shouldn't be -- shouldn't be asked to consider five rather than have us consider it in the first instance(Inaudible)."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2907.861,2907.93,"Well, Mr. --"
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2907.93,2912.294,"I'm not suggesting, this thing is -- is the answer. I want to know what the Government's position is."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2912.294,2913.378,Mr. Justice Frankfurter --
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2913.378,2928.477,"(Inaudible) because that terms on even every count in this state is some blend as is explained from the argument is some blend of judgment on what might be called facts of the inferences or atmosphere, the case is full of atmosphere."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2928.477,2940.644,"I -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I don't recall the language of the Court of Appeals in its opinion sufficiently to make a reference."
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2948.831,2953.139,"No, but you said they didn't even refer to count 5 except to say that there was a --"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2953.139,2972.544,"As far as making -- I meant to say -- as far as making the basing their holding, the Court of Appeals felt and said as I recall, that they only have to determine whether or not, some particular count was valid and sustainable and that is what they did and they did not attempt to discuss or analyze carefully all five counts."
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2972.544,2973.14,Well.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2973.14,2974.818,"Although, I do think, they referred to them."
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2976.927,2977.95,They didn't discuss it.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2979.715,2980.699,That's right.
1960.54,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2980.699,2992.833,"And to me -- and to me even if a court -- as before it, several problems and doesn't consider one, I mean articulately, discloses its mind on the title of page that didn't consider it."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2992.833,3005.26,"Well, I would like to reread that opinion and that before making definite answer to that's sort of a question, it's too important in the point you are raising in that like the basis for --"
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3005.26,3007.839,"Count 5 was based on the letter, wasn't it?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3007.839,3010.084,Yes and it -- and it's part of the membership.
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3010.084,3012.815,"And it printed the letter in full, isn't it?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3012.815,3013.306,Pardon me?
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.306,3017.35,"They printed the letter in full in their opinion, did they not?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3017.35,3020.908,"Yes, the letters -- is -- so forth, is in the opinion."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.062,3033.493,"Did the all -- did they all closely related to the same transaction, are they not, all five of the six of these counts?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3033.493,3038.315,"Well, that would -- I -- I couldn't answer that unless I knew what you have in mind now, for myself --"
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3038.315,3039.296,What did you have in mind?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3039.296,3040.161,I would like to --
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3040.161,3043.368,I have a number of questions asked about the same thing.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3043.368,3058.895,"I -- if I may -- I would answer that yes, if I will make a statement first in -- in reference to this whole subject matter why, I'm emphasizing count 5 and I think, it may a bearing on the question you are answering -- asking Mr. Justice Black."
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.239,3196.036,"Well, isn't -- isn't there a substantial difference?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3237.864,3243.355,"Oh, I -- Mr. Justice Stewart, I fail to -- to see that."
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3293.622,3293.883,Yes.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3293.883,3299.86,"If you want to -- if you want to know if this man who did, this was a Communist."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3317.811,3345.414,"Well is there -- is it your position that every time anyone writes a letter to the Congress or to a Congressman criticizing either the Congress or the Committee or to particular Congressman, that -- that that brings about a legislative purpose, which would authorize him to call him up before the Committee and ask him if he's a Communist?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3345.414,3349.449,"No sir, Mr. Chief Justice, I certainly, that's a broader question, I certainly could not say that --"
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3349.449,3352.858,"Well, isn't this just about as -- isn't this just about as broad as that?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3352.858,3354.155,"Oh, I just certainly don't think so."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3356.571,3357.091,Very well.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3357.091,3361.331,"First of all, this letter was not directed to any Congressman or any Senator."
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.326,3366.617,"Asking others, the recipients to write to (Inaudible)"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3366.617,3369.909,The Committee was apparently considering this Communist propaganda.
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3373.041,3379.024,"Well, I would like to change my question then to refer to writing a letter of this kind."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3379.024,3387.099,"Well, in -- I might have to answer that, yes, it's a hypothetical -- you have to know all the circumstances."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3398.803,3400.431,What positions?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3400.431,3404.639,His -- previously he had been a writer for newspapers.
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3436.209,3444.293,"Suppose a Communist had an objective to try to keep those bills from being passed, suppose they had that objective --"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3444.293,3444.891,Yes.
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3444.891,3458.341,"And suppose that a -- a Communist actually wrote a letter to somebody saying that, I want you to oppose this bill, would that be any offense?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3458.341,3459.111,An offense?
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3459.111,3459.909,Doesn't a Communist --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3459.909,3462.44,"Oh, that's not an offense, no sir."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3462.44,3465.801,-- right to ask people to impose bills to non-communist?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3465.801,3466.607,"Yes, indeed."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3485.11,3491.833,What was the interest if the -- if the thing that what was done was legitimate?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3491.833,3494.328,If the Act itself was legitimate?
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3494.328,3496.119,Yes.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3496.119,3509.483,I don't understand that the Committee is restricted to investigating acts that are criminal in the -- in and of themselves or by themselves.
1960.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3550.142,3555.705,How conceivably could Congress make the -- the activity of writing this letter illegal?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3555.705,3579.167,"I don't think that -- in this instance they -- they could, but I think that if they're going to treat in terms of Communist Party propaganda, the registration of propaganda agents, if they're going to think in terms of that and the resolution specifically mentioned propaganda activities, they have to know what propaganda -- Communist propaganda is and what -- is not Communist propaganda."

1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3714.112,3718.555,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd -- I've had to find the valid legislative purpose in it."

1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3718.721,3719.693,-- some place and just the fact --
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3719.693,3720.066,Well (Voice Overlap) --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3720.066,3723.161,"-- that you wrote the letter would not to me, give that, no."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3723.161,3734.01,"The letter is the letter, the letter -- whatever it is, it is and to you -- you say that they have a right to inquire into what's behind it."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3740.148,3749.992,"It seems to me, they must establish a valid legislative interest or purpose first and now here that purpose was to determine that this was Communist-inspired."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3752.015,3765.101,"If suppose they said that with any -- any citizen that they summoned before the Committee, our purpose is to inquire whether this petition you have made to -- to the Government is Communist inspired."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3767.048,3794.392,"I think that the -- that in that case, the Court might want to concern itself with the question of whether or not, they felt that the Committee conducting the inquiry had reasonable or probable cause to believe that the witness could furnish the information they were looking for or whether or not, they had reasonable cause to believe that as in this case, he was a member of the Communist Party that supplied this information on Communist techniques in this area."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3860.95,3865.564,Did they have there information that he was a Communist or not?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3865.564,3877.152,"They indicate -- the indication -- two or three places in their hearing that the Committee will see the opinion of these other people subpoenaed, were Communists and that they had information to that effect."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3888.486,3894.81,"But you mean they asked him whether they -- whether they knew -- where they had information or not, whether Communist they asked him before?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3894.81,3897.516,Yes.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3945.298,3954.524,"Well, was their anything in this record except the counsel's own statement, we have information that you are a Communist."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3954.944,3958.372,"As one, it's not a great deal that comes out in this --"
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3958.372,3960.791,Was their anything except that statement?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3960.791,3975.211,"Yes, for example, I asked him if he wanted to deny the accuracy of the testimony of Mrs. Alberta Ahearn before another committee regarding his Party membership and he declined to take the opportunity to comment on that."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3975.896,3977.249,Is that evidence against him --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3977.249,3977.847,But --
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3977.847,3980.107,-- in this contempt matter?

1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3985.747,3990.284,"But can you base -- can you base a commitment on it, if it isn't?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3990.284,3991.676,I would think so.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4032.892,4036.561,Are you suggesting that (Voice Overlap) based in the alleged Communist activity?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4036.561,4039.844,The -- the Committee had that information on that record --
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4039.844,4046.481,"And was that conviction, that Kentucky conviction based on anything related to Communism?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4046.481,4048.37,"Related to the Communism, yes."
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4055.534,4061.136,"I thought it was -- I thought it was entirely for racial activity, wasn't it?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4061.136,4063.269,"Not entirely, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4088.321,4090.956,"Destroying property how, by doing what?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4090.956,4098.872,"That indictment didn't specify, but according to other information, it was the explosion in the house -- the house had been bombed."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4098.872,4099.785,Doing what?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4099.785,4103.381,This house had been bombed or dynamite gone off in the -- in the --
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4103.381,4105.314,-- was he indicted for bombing a house?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4105.314,4122.493,"In the case -- course of this addition indictment, in addition to the charge of -- of the sedition of advocating, they also can set forth the paragraph stating in essence that he had destroyed a property in order to attain a political end."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4122.493,4124.663,That was his own home?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4124.663,4126.47,I'm not quite clear -- one he had bought with --
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4126.47,4126.948,Is that --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4126.948,4130.716,"-- whether he had title in or whether the (Inaudible) had title, I'm not sure, pardon?"
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4130.716,4138.183,"No one has to do it, but as the case, where he was charged with having guns of colored people to live in a white section?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4138.183,4142.604,"Oh, that's -- that was the circumstance that was not on the charge, I don't believe."
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4169.752,4172.724,"But is, supposedly his -- his own house wasn't it?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4172.724,4175.499,"I would say, he probably still owned it."

1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4176.33,4176.752,Yes.
1960.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4176.752,4179.281,Was he convicted to that offence?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4179.281,4195.501,"Yes, but it was reversed on Nelson versus (Voice Overlap) the Nelson wasn't decided until later and it was decided before the case reached -- reached the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed it based on Nelson as having preempted it."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4223.859,4229.477,I don't quite understand what probable cause has to do with the case of this kind.
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4253.623,4268.068,"Mr. Justice Black, I would approach it from the other side and say that if they don't have reason to believe that the witness has information useful and helpful to the Committee in an area of a valid legislative purpose, I think, should not call the witness."
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4268.068,4274.788,"Well that's why I didn't see the relevance of you continuing, both in the idea of what the Committee had probable cause to say."
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4274.788,4277.919,-- This has been discussed in earlier cases.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4341.924,4350.861,"Well Mr. Yeagley, do you think that it's enough for a foundation of reasonable probable cause as we put it?"
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4366.587,4368.451,Yes.
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4371.148,4378.444,Without disclosing anything at all or what this is?
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4378.444,4384.161,"I -- I -- Mr. Justice Brennan, I would say yes, with the reservation."
1960.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4433.128,4436.864,Well this is because you think there is enough evidence otherwise to support --
1960.54,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,4436.864,4437.141,Yes.
1960.54,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4465.952,4482.168,"What you're thinking is the withdrawal between the Committee's right to ask Mr. Runway to give the names of the people who had something to do with his books and the -- the (Inaudible) to get these people (Voice Overlap) to give the information they ask, both of them were seeking to influence legislations."

1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5139.361,5148.996,This was the counsel of Committee in Mr. Arens who was asking the questions at this time.

1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5604.595,5605.859,That he testified to some length.
1960.54,9,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5605.859,5609.59,"-- in his written testimony, for there is new testimony, there's no question about it."
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5620.668,5622.554,I have not read this Boston testimony --
1960.54,9,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5622.554,5624.084,"I see -- I see, alright."
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5624.38,5625.354,-- I'm sorry I'm not familiar with it at all.
1960.54,9,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5625.354,5625.65,Alright -- alright --
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5625.65,5626.408,It's my first time to hear about it.
1960.54,9,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5626.408,5636.455,Is there anything unusual about that practice on the part of the government -- take into a different -- taking the same witnesses on the different parts of the country to testify to the same thing?
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5636.455,5639.198,I know that Mr. Fishman has -- has testified with him.
1960.54,9,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5745.912,5746.967,"Well, you've been interrupted --"
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5746.967,5747.53,-- trying -- trying to answer the --
1960.54,9,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5747.53,5750.274,"And up close, not to make it in an orderly (Voice Overlap)"
1960.54,9,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,5750.274,5761.779,"The question is nice -- I may -- well, I frankly feel that this is a case where that serves a better purpose on the -- than me trying to (Inaudible)."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,5858.164,5859.397,If the Court please?
1960.54,10,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5859.397,5861.179,Mr. Coe.
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,5861.179,5863.58,Mr. Justice.
1960.54,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6229.59,6242.102,"Mr. Coe, just before you leave that, on -- on the top of page 14 of the Government's brief, there is quote, Mr. Arens' -- part of Mr. Arens' statement with respect to one of these questions."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6258.002,6258.521,What kind of --
1960.54,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6258.521,6259.058,-- just before coming out of Atlanta.
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6263.351,6268.376,"Now, only the Court please, the statement of the investigator for the Committee, Mr. Arens --"
1960.54,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6268.376,6270.781,"Well, that's just what I -- that's what I just read."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6270.781,6274.015,Your Honor will find where that started on page 40 of the record.
1960.54,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6276.626,6278.3,No -- no I don't want you to but I just --
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6278.3,6285.296,Did any Committee member -- did any Committee member make any such assertion as a Committee member?
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6285.296,6287.055,"You mean in the trial of the case, Your Honor?"
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6287.055,6288.078,"No -- no, the hearings."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6288.078,6291.258,All the Committee members and the chairman made elaborate statements.
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6291.258,6296.237,"No -- no, on this point, on the question that Justice Stewart just asked you."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6323.8,6325.478,If I correctly understand Your Honor's question --
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6325.478,6331.041,"Well, I must be very stupid not to put a very simple thought into words."
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6339.175,6341.27,"That, if the Court please, I can't answer."
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6343.727,6345.147,Alright.
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6345.147,6346.344,But I -- I just don't --
1960.54,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6346.344,6347.292,If -- alright that's an answer.
1960.54,10,29694,john_m_coe,,6347.292,6349.735,I just don't remember.
1960.54,10,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6349.735,6354.001,"If you want to consult with Mr. Boudin on it, you may do so and then answer it."
1960.54,11,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,6354.001,6357.866,"May I state to the Court, no Committee member made that statement."
1960.54,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6357.866,6361.593,"Alright, very well."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6361.593,6378.086,"Then if the Court please, I will proceed to the next question that is had -- has to do with count number 5 and the -- the question, ""Was he a member of the Communist Party at the time he signed this letter which is in effect, the initiation of a petition?"
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6406.13,6419.3,May I ask you whether you contend that merely because people petition Congress on any subject that immunizes them from being called with reference to that petition.
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6419.3,6420.265,"It does not, Your Honor."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6431.369,6433.361,That if a man petitions Congress --
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6433.361,6433.804,It -- it --
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6433.804,6441.773,"-- thereafter, he can no longer be -- he cannot be called and questioned regarding anything pertaining that exercise of the right to petition."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6441.773,6442.48,"No, no, Your Honor."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6451.929,6457.942,"He can't be asked -- did you -- were you stimulated, were you asked by some interested party to write that."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6459.925,6461.819,"I am inclined to think he cannot, Your Honor."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6461.819,6466.207,"But you know the whole practice of Congress is against that, don't you?"
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6466.207,6467.261,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6468.045,6472.783,Have you ever heard of the -- the Committee dealing with lobbying and with utility regulations?
1960.54,12,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6472.783,6474.323,That was my committee.
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6474.323,6475.6,I realized that's the one.
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6475.6,6480.138,Have you heard of other Committees that had been doing that all the time?
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6480.138,6481.243,"To tell you the truth Your Honor, I'm not --"
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6481.243,6492.055,"I'm not saying that's this case as such, but I just want to know what is implied by this argument that this was an exercise of the petitioning right."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6492.055,6499.954,"I know that the Correct Practice Act deals with approaching people, because that deals with social money under certain systematic ways."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6526.564,6532.135,"And because I have a financial interest and petitioned Congress, that takes me out of the First Amendment, does it?"
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6532.135,6533.736,"No, I do not think so, Your Honor."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6627.894,6637.932,"But, of course, if Congress has no power to legislate with the implication of that and it can't inquire the basis of legislation."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6637.932,6638.049,I think --
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6638.049,6649.853,"And if it has power to legislate, does it make any difference which power of Congress would be involved in the exercise of its power to legislate."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6649.853,6651.543,That is a philosophical question.
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6651.543,6653.79,I -- I think that's a very practical question.
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6680.961,6682.225,Let me answer you -- Your Honor's question this way.
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6682.225,6683.538,That's not a philosophic question.
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6685.041,6686.782,-- let me answer Your Honor's question.
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6743.062,6748.819,But it could find out whether the shipment contained a machine gun or candy?
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6748.819,6763.775,"I think -- if it please Your Honor, I think it would be pertinent but when you asked him if he was a member of the Communist Party when he did, pertinent to the simple proper thing that you and I, and a man in this Courtroom could do."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6769.696,6772.984,I'm not -- I'm -- I didn't mean to intimate remotely.
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6789.193,6796.151,"If the Court please, we approach our case one at a time just like the Court does and we are dealing with the question in this particular way --"
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6796.151,6802.234,"Oh, but your -- the emphasis has been on the fact that that this was an exercise of the petitioning right."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6802.234,6810.874,"I -- it seems to me, it was because you can't allow petition by yourself within your transcripts (Inaudible) in this elaborate society of ours."
1960.54,12,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6817.274,6840.087,"So therefore, you now imply that because you exercise the petitioning right and because you asked somebody else to exercise it, therefore, the witnesses are immune and I'm suggesting to you that the nature of the exercise of the petitioning right may be and has been itself a subject matter of investigation by Congress."
1960.54,12,29694,john_m_coe,,6840.087,6843.337,"That is possibly true, but I doubt it, Your Honor."
