1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,14.765,17.746,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.145,127.195,"Mr. Weill, was there any impediment to Deta’s parents’ marrying?"
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,127.195,131.557,"No, there was none that we know of."
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,131.557,133.586,"There was a paternity suit here, wasn’t there?"
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,133.586,135.28,"Yes, there was a paternity adjudication."
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,135.28,136.482,What prompted that?
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,139.264,146.613,"At some point, Ms. Trimble may have been on public aid and it would have been a public aid suit."
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,156.44,166.335,"Would this law suit get down to that as a litigation between the child and the other blood relatives of the decedent, correct?"
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,166.335,172.397,"That is correct, but it is a question of whether a state which gives inheritance rights to children generally can exclude illegitimate --"
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,172.397,174.926,"I know what question it; this is what it amounts to, isn’t it?"
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,174.926,177.783,"Yes, that is correct."
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.439,220.347,"I take it, Mr. Weill, from your comment just now you concede that the rationality standard applies?"
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,220.347,227.491,"No, we do not concede that, we still believe that strict scrutiny or some form of heightened scrutiny is potentially applicable."
1976.75-5952,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,242.22,245.799,I thought that you said that under any standard of rationality?
1976.75-5952,0,33678,james_d_weill,,245.799,250.675,"We said under any standard of equal protection review, the statute must fall."
1976.75-5952,1,35484,miles_n_beermann,,1168.854,1173.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-5952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.296,1256.335,"Mr. Beermann, we are not really talking about very much of the estate, are we?"
1976.75-5952,1,35484,miles_n_beermann,,1256.335,1260.338,"No, Your Honors, as a matter of fact we are talking about $1500."
1976.75-5952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.338,1267.826,And your clients concede there -- or maybe it does not make any difference anyway.
1976.75-5952,1,35484,miles_n_beermann,,1272.131,1287.994,"Well, my client -- I only get one client, Your Honor, and that is the mother of the decedent, so that she would be the blood paternal grandmother of the little girl."
1976.75-5952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.994,1302.945,"I suppose you are not defending the Illinois statute as a matter of policy if you were a legislator, when it says that the paternity suit or an acknowledgement is not enough, there has to be marriage in addition."
1976.75-5952,1,35484,miles_n_beermann,,1302.945,1311.233,"Well, it stills set up a mechanism whereby the child can be recognized."
1976.75-5952,2,33678,james_d_weill,,2937.825,2939.142,"Just one point, Your Honor."
