1956.571,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.876,"Number 571, Leon F. Carroll and Daniel J. Stewart, Petitioners, versus United States of America."
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,22.962,27.191,Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court.
1956.571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.409,315.247,"On the interpretation of the Court of Appeals that has given its local statute here, the only question, that the issue on this case is whether it's a final order or not."
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,315.247,315.68,Yes.
1956.571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.68,316.634,That's the only thing (Inaudible)
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,316.634,319.933,That's the only thing.
1956.571,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,449.385,457.423,And you don't shrink from the conclusion that if -- if it isn't separably reviewable it can't be reviewed at all.
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,457.423,458.114,"No, sir."
1956.571,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,458.114,459.389,You don't shrink from that conclusion.
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,460.253,461.477,"That's the necessary conclusion, Your Honor."
1956.571,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,461.477,465.435,Yes.
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,465.435,466.648,"Now, I might --"
1956.571,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,466.648,469.205,"Do you agree then, as I understand it (Inaudible)"
1956.571,0,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,477.479,487.702,"Yes, as far as the Government is concerned, yes."
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,643.546,646.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,711.424,712.527,What do you say in the brief?
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,722.118,731.58,That's at page 6 of the Government's brief.
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,758.833,765.877,"Is your argument, of course the defendant, if his motion were denied couldn't come up right away, could he?"
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,765.877,766.692,He could not appeal.
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,767.264,774.818,"But you say he could appeal at the end, it doesn't add, if he gets a -- a conviction wherein erroneously the motion was denied."
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,774.818,774.909,"Yes, sir."
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,774.909,779.175,You say -- you say that gives him a right to appeal at some stage.
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,779.175,779.519,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,779.519,783.22,And the same right of appeal means that you should have it whenever it's possible to have it.
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,783.22,783.982,And that's -- that's exactly --
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,783.982,786.6,And that is before there's a conviction or an acquittal.
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,786.6,788.868,"Well, of course, we can have a right of appeal at that point --"
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,788.868,789.47,"I say you can't have it, then therefore --"
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,789.47,789.891,"That's right, yes."
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,789.891,792.128,(Inaudible)
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,792.128,793.071,That -- that is our --
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,793.071,794.338,"That -- that's your argument, is it?"
1956.571,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,794.338,795.685,That's our argument.
1956.571,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,795.685,797.831,You could make much more by repeating seven times.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1341.504,1342.407,May I?
1956.571,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1342.407,1346.871,"Yes you may go -- go ahead for a few minutes, sir."
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1346.871,1348.84,"First, if it please the Court."
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1392.813,1394.17,May I interrupt you.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1398.162,1399.045,"Yes, sir."
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1399.045,1400.091,And has remained the same?
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1400.091,1400.472,"Yes, sir."
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1457.666,1473.329,You even have to answer the suggestion made by Mr. Greene that if you don't give a (Inaudible) application -- it's -- it's (Inaudible) it'd meaningless.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1475.467,1475.781,"Well, Your Honor --"
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1475.781,1486.273,"Do you see any -- do you see any situation in which this provision can become operative, if it doesn't do this one?"
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1486.273,1488.824,I don't -- I -- I say this.
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1570.878,1577.2,"But this -- but this -- the problem before it, there's the attached question of constitutionality at all, right?"
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1577.2,1578.808,"I think it does, Your Honor."
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1578.808,1592.173,"It's perfectly clear that the -- that the Government cannot get, double jeopardy precludes the Government from reviewing a finding on the merits in the criminal case in favor of the defendant."
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1633.742,1634.136,"No, sir."
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1634.136,1636.894,The question is whether this is a final judgment --
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1636.894,1636.925,Yes.
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1636.925,1639.175,-- or maybe a statutory obstacle.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1639.175,1640.141,That's right.
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1640.355,1640.448,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1640.448,1641.501,-- be if this -- if their relief --
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1641.501,1655.926,"What happened to you -- what happened to you is, is there any scope for the operation of this provision 230 -- 105 if -- if it doesn't justify or sustain an appeal in this case."
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1664.385,1664.466,My answer --
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1664.466,1668.441,-- the sum of the argument to say that Congress didn't do anything futile.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1668.441,1668.484,My -- my --
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1668.484,1670.31,"At least, not obviously, so?"
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1670.31,1677.365,My answer to Your Honor is that it -- it does not confer any right upon the Government and does not give them any way to proceed.
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1677.365,1682.584,It was a misconception on the -- based on a historical desire to get an advisory opinion.
1956.571,2,19605,curtis_p_mitchell,,1682.707,1683.43,Yes.
1956.571,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1685.6,1696.683,All right.
