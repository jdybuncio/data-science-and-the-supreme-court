1971.70-128,2,15660,a_l_crouch,,1637.251,1640.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-128,3,31659,john_f_morehead,,2881.389,2910.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I believe that broadly stated the issue here is whether there should be the opportunity for equal participation in the electoral process by candidates, with or without money?"
1971.70-128,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.09,2915.198,"Go ahead counsel, situation is under control."
1971.70-128,3,31659,john_f_morehead,,2915.198,2928.266,"I will restate it, I believe broadly that the issue here is whether there should be the opportunity for equal participation in the electoral process by candidates."
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3532.635,3536.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3738.624,3744.51,"Mr. Bailey, could they charge for running in the general election?"
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3744.51,3745.94,"They do not, Your Honor."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3745.94,3750.844,I said could the State of Texas constitutionally do it?
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3750.844,3758.234,"I think that Your Honor, you would have a bigger problem, or would have one."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3767.789,3780.995,"But if they use exact same filing fee in the general election, would that be constitutionally permissible?"
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3780.995,3784.836,"I do not know Your Honor that I think -- well, I will go back to this."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3822.228,3825.536,But is your answer that it might be.
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3825.536,3831.351,"I think that if you put some type of filing fee on the, the ultimate general, on the general election."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3831.351,3834.551,The same fee as in this case?
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3834.551,3838.017,I think you might have some constitutional questions there Your Honor but I think that --
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3838.017,3841.858,"Well, do not you have the same constitutional questions here?"
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3841.858,3842.212,No Your Honor.
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3842.212,3848.696,Where the primary is “an intrical part” of the election machine near the State of Texas.
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3848.696,3864.627,"Yes sir, but in another part of this intrical machinery is a fact that a candidate, if he wants to be only ballot, the general election, there is a process for getting only, will not cost him this filing fee."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3866.089,3868.549,But will it not cost him something?
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3868.549,3870.491,"No sir, it will not."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3870.491,3873.772,"Well, will it not cost him to pay for the petition?"
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3873.772,3881.416,"I presume, it would cost him this and possibly the stamp or some of the other expenses in this nature Your Honor."
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3918.644,3926.658,"Mr. Bailey, one more question aside from this, why did you give us exhibit A?"
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3930.932,3935.228,I am not sure which one Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3935.228,3946.76,It said new statute.
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3946.76,3965.613,I do not know at the moment I think that we will just put it in so the Court could see what had been done in connection with the situation that the trial court had or the court below had put us into that the legislature had to take certain action and this was --
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3965.613,3968.713,What did the legislature had to do?
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3968.713,3970.064,"Well, I think Your Honor --"
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3970.064,3975.459,"What the legislature did was to say, if we do not do something, they will have already done something."
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3975.459,3976.799,Yes sir.
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3976.799,3978.702,Is that the only purpose of it?
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3978.702,3979.355,I think in a --
1971.70-128,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3979.355,3986.65,"I can understand why the legislature did it, but I was just wondering why you as an officer of this Court felt obliged to bring it to Court."
1971.70-128,4,37697,pat_bailey,,3986.65,4004.119,"Your Honor, I think it is nothing more than to show what the legislature had done because I think we are in this area of filing fees in the election process, for the Court to know what we are trying to do."
