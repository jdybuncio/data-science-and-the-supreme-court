1991.91-712,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.168,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-712, United States v. Humberto Alvarez-Machain."
1991.91-712,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,11.841,14.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-712,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,91.642,97.907,"General Starr, as a preliminary matter, has the State Department Legal Advisors' Office joined your brief?"
1991.91-712,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,97.907,113.556,"The legal advisor is not on the brief, but the brief expresses the views of the United States, which includes the Department of State, and Justice Blackmun, there should be no significance to the fact that they are not shown on the brief."
1991.91-712,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,133.02,134.853,"Nothing formal to that effect, however?"
1991.91-712,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,134.853,137.504,He did provide--
1991.91-712,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,137.504,137.755,Just opined?
1991.91-712,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,137.755,146.991,"--A letter or an opinion, that is correct, but that is a customary way, Justice Blackmun, in which the legal advisor expresses his views."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1549.833,1554.107,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.683,1702.977,"How about Americans in Mexico who are charged with having committed a crime, in America?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1702.977,1728.525,"Justice White, it would be our view based on the language of the treaty, its purpose and the fact that it is the exclusive means, that Americans should not be kidnapped consistent with this treaty either, because the limitations, for example, on the political offense doctrine and the other limitations in the treaty also, we believe, should lead a court to conclude that kidnapping to circumvent those limitations would also be a violation of the treaty."
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.895,1763.12,I don't understand what you mean by a specific arrangment... what article 9 said if you don't turn it over you may consider prosecution.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1763.12,1778.251,"--Your Honor... I'm sorry... Justice Scalia, what article 9 does, as it says, if you want to obtain personal jurisdiction over a Mexican national you have two alternatives."
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.089,1791.28,It does not go on to say and nothing else.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1804.781,1811.396,But it can't be understood as also suggesting that a kidnapping in violation of those terms would be proper.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.076,1813.847,--nothing about the point--
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1813.847,1816.331,--But those words can't be read in isolation.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.491,1836.967,"--The rule in Rauscher, I mean the rule you suggest may be a reasonable one, but it wasn't the rule that was pronounced in Rauscher."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1869.051,1877.434,"Justice Scalia, I think that the principle in Rauscher is that the court may find an inherent provision that's not specifically stated."
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.102,1913.067,You don't suggest that Mexico could not have voluntarily turned over... turned over one of their nationals for a trial in the United States?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1913.067,1920.834,I would suggest that the Mexican Government would certainly not turn over a Mexican national because of the restrictions--
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.834,1922.775,Would it violate the treaty?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1922.775,1923.095,--No.
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.715,1925.416,Has it ever happened?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1925.416,1932.812,I do not know that Mexico has handed over a national in the course of our relations.
1991.91-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1932.812,1933.493,But you don't think it would violate the treaty?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1933.493,1934.182,No.
1991.91-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.384,1935.784,Do you?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1935.784,1936.523,--No.
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.523,1947.252,So it wouldn't be that the treaty would not be the only way of securing the presence of a Mexican national in the United States?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1947.252,1958.708,"There has been a long history of informal relations between Mexico and the United States, and those are perfectly consistent with the treaty and with our version of the treaty, our position on the treaty."
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.708,1970.348,"You don't think that if Mexico turned over one of its citizens informally, not under the treaty, would the defendant have a--"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1970.348,1971.438,If Mexico--
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.438,1980.945,"--If they turned him over and he was being... he was charged with a crime here, would he have a valid motion for dismissal of the case?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1980.945,1991.541,"--I think Mexico has the ability to defease that right from him, I mean, I think that and that is perfectly consistent with Rauscher and the specialty cases."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.541,1995.233,So what you are saying maybe it's Mexico's right and not the individual's right?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1995.233,1996.464,"No, well, it's both."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.806,2002.41,If an individual's right can be defeated by Mexico saying we don't care--
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2002.41,2003.181,--And that was true in Rauscher.
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.254,2028.952,--Doesn't that suggest then that it's the foreign sovereign's right and that the individual may be a third-party beneficiary so long as that... but it isn't primarily the individual's right.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2028.952,2038.489,"But there is a long history in this country of self-execution, of the notion that extradition treaties are self-executing, and extradition treaties serve different purposes."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.518,2108.346,"But you agree that if Mexico had not protested this and said we don't care about this, then the treaty would not bar the trial of this person?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2108.346,2115.182,"If Mexico had given its consent, I think that would be very similar to what Justice O'Connor talked about with respect to contracts."
1991.91-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.102,2135.337,What is your case authority for that proposition?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2135.337,2136.726,With respect to the informal renditions?
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.797,2188.123,"Well, suppose that it happened in this case and the United States, well, do you think the rule of specialty would apply then?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2188.123,2192.455,The rule of specialty would apply in an informal case?
1991.91-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.996,2280.47,"Mr. Hoffman, assuming that the kidnapping was a violation of international law, do you assert that gives a U.S. court any power to remedy the situation?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2280.47,2283.412,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that that--"
1991.91-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.412,2285.773,In a subsequent prosecution of the individual?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2285.773,2290.327,"--That raises different questions, clearly, than the ones upon which this case was decided."
1991.91-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2320.928,2327.262,"Well, if we were to conclude the treaty doesn't cover this, do you fall back on some violation of international law?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2327.262,2333.346,"Justice O'Connor, there were alternative grounds for affirmance that were presented to the Ninth Circuit and the courts below."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.932,2503.73,"If there were a case concededly controlling from this Court, governing a particular... would it make any difference whether Mexico knew about the case or not?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2503.73,2528.495,"No, Chief Justice Rehnquist, if this Court were to find that Ker stands for a broad principle that notwithstanding treaty obligations a court should try the person who comes before it no matter how that person comes before it, then obviously the treaty would not, well, it would apply."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.495,2542.956,"What you're saying then is that the holding of Ker, the teaching, whatever you want to call it, has not been understood in the international community as broadly as the Government is saying it has?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2542.956,2547.06,"That's correct, and I don't think it's been understood by lower court cases."
1991.91-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.133,2610.424,"Well, counsel, I think your point that this was not against a background where Mexico knew of our policy is much diminished in force by the Government's citation of a letter in 1906 from the acting Secretary of State pointing out to the Mexican Government that Ker is on the books and that the Government of the United States follows that principle with reference to persons taken from foreign sovereignty."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2610.424,2616.328,"But the Martinez case is a different case, and it is fully consistent with the position that we are asserting before this Court."
1991.91-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.071,2652.382,But the point is that the Mexican Government has been advised of this doctrine and of its applicability.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2652.382,2679.48,"--But Justice Kennedy, the Mexican Government was never advised and the United States has never asserted... and it's my belief that the United States has never asserted before this case that the United States reserves the rights with its extradition partners to itself engage in kidnapping from other countries to avoid the limitations and extradition treaties, and that's our main point, that the extradition treaty... and this is the point that Mexico--"
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.48,2685.965,"What... you're referring to the limitations in the expedition treaty, and you referred earlier to the limitations in Article 9."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2690.719,2703.169,"But Justice Scalia, the limitation is the fact that Article 9 talks about how the United States may obtain personal jurisdiction over a Mexican national."
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.169,2707.782,You create the limitation by simply positing that it can't be done any other way.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2710.586,2710.904,But Article 9--
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.904,2711.876,--That it can't be done in any other way.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2711.876,2721.643,--Article 9 comes with a long and historical heritage in the sense that before Article 9 the Mexican Government said it would not extradite its nationals.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.251,2772.048,"But there's no prohibition of any other manner of getting the individual back to the United States except to the extent that some such prohibition exists in international law, quite apart from the treaty."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2772.048,2782.576,"Well, but there's no prohibition in... no explicit prohibition on the fact that you can't execute summarily the person that's extradited, or you can't torture them."
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.885,2818.109,Would it be any less shocking to them if they had no extradition treaty with the United States and the same thing occurred?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2818.109,2819.892,"--No, it would be shocking in both--"
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.892,2821.311,"Of course, it would be no less shocking at all."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2825.057,2847.449,"--There was a... I think that is not the case in the sense that just because the United States engages in egregious conduct that violates basic principles of the international legal order and it violates them in many different ways doesn't mean that it doesn't also violate the explicit provisions... the clear intent of this treaty, and I think that--"
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.449,2847.69,The clear intent.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2848.772,2850.655,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.064,2880.388,"Mr. Hoffman, can I ask you a question about the text of the treaty?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2890.835,2900.623,"That is what the Court refers to in Rauscher, that it had been the custom that when a person had been handed over in that manner that they could only be tried for that--"
1991.91-712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.623,2904.314,Was that a custom independently of any written language in treaties--
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2904.314,2904.534,--Yes.
1991.91-712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.534,2906.207,--Or was it a customary provision of treaties?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2906.207,2907.035,"Yes, it was a customary--"
1991.91-712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.035,2910.819,It makes a big difference it seems to me.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2910.819,2913.95,--I don't know if I can answer that.
1991.91-712,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.975,2928.152,"The opinion itself doesn't refer to any such provision in the treaty, and I had assumed that they had implied that that was just a fair way to read the treaty, that if we followed the procedure--"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2928.152,2961.453,"--My understanding, and certainly the Justice Friendly decision in Fiacani would suggest, that principles of international comity would require the same result, that if someone is handed over informally as sovereign nations have the right to do that that principle would still obtain, that essentially what has happened is that the State that has handed the person over has essentially given up a sovereign right to give that person asylum, and so the authority is limited in terms of prosecution to what... to that piece of sovereignty that the Government has given up."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.81,2977.356,"--Mr. Hoffman, certainly the Court in Frisbie read Ker very broadly."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2990.071,2992.685,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that's true."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3016.364,3024.158,"But if you're right that the fact that it was a governmental kidnapping is important, there was... it's a governmental kidnapping in Frisbie, too."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3024.158,3029.781,"Well, but the reason that it's important because it's a governmental kidnapping is that it invokes our treaty obligations."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.181,3038.536,Why should the treaty obligations be more important when a court is determining jurisdiction than perhaps violations of the Constitution of the United States?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3038.536,3072.25,"--Well, I think that obviously the Constitution is more important from our standpoint as Americans than treaties, but treaties have been very important to this country's history, and I think this Court has recognized that treaties may place a limitation on the authority of the United States Government to seize, and that those limitations must be fulfilled, and it's not just because it's a treaty obligation, it's because those treaty obligations are part of a web of international relationships that are essential to this country, and have been thought to be essential to this country from the beginning of time."
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.25,3076.35,That really doesn't distinguish them from a constitutional principle.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3080.303,3084.297,But the Constitution does... was found in Frisbie not to place limits of that kind.
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.159,3121.914,So in this case the accused murderer perhaps never will be tried.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3121.914,3126.055,"--I don't think that the Court can assume that, because Mexico has--"
1991.91-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.055,3128.877,"Well, I thought that was your point that you were just making."
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3128.877,3142.337,"--No, but the point is that it will be a different... what will happen is different, and in fact in this case the policies of Frisbie are satisfied to some degree because Mexico will agree to prosecute."
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.775,3175.058,That's no bargain.
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3179.943,3185.075,"Well, but that's a traditional form of that kind of treaty provision--"
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.075,3186.517,You mean they say may when they mean must?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3186.517,3186.698,--No.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.978,3201.807,Are you telling me that Article 9 means that Mexico must prosecute--
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3201.807,3202.017,No.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.017,3203.339,--If there is evidence to prosecute?
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3203.339,3203.99,No.
1991.91-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.172,3209.065,"Does it mean Mexico can prosecute if it feels like it, and if it doesn't feel like it it need not prosecute?"
1991.91-712,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3209.065,3209.353,--No.
1991.91-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.977,3273.618,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
1991.91-712,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3293.885,3299.097,I think that the court did not come... I don't understand that to be the case.
1991.91-712,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.001,3342.337,"General Starr, do you agree that Mexico had an obligation to prosecute under Article 9--"
