1991.90-1141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.659,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1141, Rafeh-Rafie Ardestani v. Immigration and Naturalization Service."
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,39.316,53.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.019,186.741,"We're really not... those are really quite peripheral facts, aren't they, Mr. Soloway?"
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,195.529,197.679,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.423,280.045,"Mr. Soloway, I mean, that's all... yes, I mean, it's very sympathetic, but the fact is even in criminal trials, when someone is wrongly prosecuted, and it turns out there was no basis for the prosecution, EAJA does not reimburse the wrongfully prosecuted criminal defendant."
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,284.169,285.561,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.561,288.583,"So, we're here to read this statute."
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,298.893,299.913,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.913,300.243,Good.
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,300.854,312.832,"This statute says that adversary adjudications, that is the adjudications for which EAJA applies, are those that are under Section 554."
1991.90-1141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.589,448.733,I don't know.
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,473.824,482.302,"Your Honor, of course, if they were tantamount to criminal proceedings, were this Court to so hold, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be invoked."
1991.90-1141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.113,504.164,--Of course the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not a right to have counsel paid for.
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,504.164,509.518,"Well, I'm talking about appointed counsel, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.221,648.18,"We will resume there at 1:00, Mr. Soloway."
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,648.18,649.081,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-1141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.081,674.969,"We'll resume argument now in No. 90-1141, Ardestani against INS."
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,675.86,679.453,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.665,788.907,Have we held that?
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,788.907,794.65,"--Your Honor, the practice... let me answer your question directly."
1991.90-1141,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.161,848.971,But that's in legislative history materials.
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,855.857,861.301,"Except for the interpretation and the same reasoning that's urged in this case, Your Honor."
1991.90-1141,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.301,869.618,"In other words, if they are under the APA or whatever it is, then you argue that by a parity of reasoning, the deportation proceeding is also under?"
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,869.618,877.032,"Mr. Justice Stevens, that's largely correct, but there's even more to the argument than that."
1991.90-1141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.966,935.954,"Well, isn't there a case in this Court that says that INS proceedings are not under the APA?"
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,939.675,962.311,"Well, Justice White, the Marcello case was not an EAJA case, but there this Court was called to look upon a divergence, a unique divergence that existed 36 years ago between the Immigration Nationality Act and the APA."
1991.90-1141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.409,995.615,"Well, does a proceeding under the APA have any... what does it mean to say under the APA?"
1991.90-1141,0,21574,david_n_soloway,,995.615,1002.109,"Your Honor, the statute here says under Section 554."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1748.329,1753.342,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.528,1816.734,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask you right there, if one were to agree, and I understand you don't agree with this, but the word ""under"" should be given the meaning"
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1821.279,1848.286,"I think that's a close question, the... but I... only because procedures adopted by regulation now have brought the administrative deportation proceedings closer, and very close, to what is described in Section 554."
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.477,1965.25,That seems like a good answer.
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1968.443,1993.207,"The... in the 1985 reenactment of EAJA, there was a reference in the legislative history, in the reports to a procedure under the Social Security Act, which was a pilot program that has now been entirely discontinued as of 1987."
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.456,2069.254,I'm not really troubled with the legislative history part of it.
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2074.248,2075.331,They are not at all covered.
1991.90-1141,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.331,2081.793,"In the case we had last term, Melconian, was a court action, I take it, which is different."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2081.793,2081.994,That is correct.
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.75,2141.403,"Well, if it means that, the Social Security Act, there should be no fees under the Social Security."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2141.403,2145.126,"Well, that was a question left open in this Court's decision."
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.126,2147.029,"But I mean if your argument is consistent, that's the result it would lead to, wouldn't it?"
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2147.029,2154.074,"Well, we don't know whether this now discontinued procedure was subject to Section 554 or not."
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.306,2195.013,"But you're saying if a statute enacts the precisely identical procedures to those set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, that then EAJA fees would not apply... say you enact a new statute... Nuclear Regulatory Agency, or something or another... that that would not apply unless the statute, its only word said that these procedures... these proceedings are governed by the APA."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2199.025,2207.38,"Parallel procedures would not do it, but they would not preclude the possibility that Section 554 would also apply."
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.058,2221.961,"--You have precisely that problem in the National Labor Relations Act, don't you?"
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2233.608,2240.373,I can't say that I've looked into that precise question in connection with this case.
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.097,2263.45,"Well, it's very clear if you read the word ""under"" to mean governed by."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2266.542,2273.919,"Well, that... there are barriers to reading it that way, Mr. Justice."
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.999,2330.279,But if... couldn't one counter with the argument that why would Congress single out this small category of agency proceedings for different treatment from all others when the equities would seem to be the same and the purpose of the statute would seem to apply?
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2330.279,2331.571,"--Well, the equities may--"
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.571,2332.663,And without saying a word about it?
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2332.663,2337.224,--The equities may not be the same.
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.764,2418.946,It seems to me what you're saying is that the cases in which the Government's position would not be substantially justified are a very small number of the total universe.
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2418.946,2438.941,"The Congress might conclude that because these all are a matter that involve discretion on the part of the Government, and they're all matters on which the burden of proof has shifted to the alien, that there would be very few cases in which the Government's position could fairly be said not to be substantially justified."
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.57,2469.262,"Well, didn't they budget about 100 times as much money for this statute as they've actually spent?"
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2469.262,2476.897,"Well, it's true that the costs have not reached the initial estimates that were made when it was--"
1991.90-1141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.897,2478.027,They've failed by about 99 percent.
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2478.027,2479.59,--That is correct.
1991.90-1141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.964,2565.967,How about the Erwin decision last year?
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2565.967,2590.2,"Well, the Erwin decision was one in which Congress had clearly subjected the category of cases to a waiver of sovereign immunity and the only question was whether the ordinary rules of the road for waivers of sovereign immunity, the usual tolling rules of the road, would apply."
1991.90-1141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.2,2595.773,So you think the narrow reading of waivers is... that rule is still in place?
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2595.773,2629.226,"Well, this Court has repeatedly referred to it, and has referred to it approvingly in an analogous contexts because ultimately it is a rule that assures against intrusion by the courts into the legislative function of determining what claims on the public fisk should be honored and what claims should not."
1991.90-1141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.944,2765.639,"I'm going to have to start reading your footnotes, if they're important enough to bring up in oral argument."
1991.90-1141,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2767.96,2777.647,"--Well, we have not yet refrained from writing footnotes, although I don't take issue with those who have."
1991.90-1141,2,21574,david_n_soloway,,2859.285,2865.018,Thank you.
1991.90-1141,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.483,2928.516,"Mr.... your time has expired, Mr. Soloway."
