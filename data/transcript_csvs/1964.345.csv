1964.345,0,43452,theodore_e_wolcott,,16.059,21.393,May it please the Court.
1964.345,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.134,136.213,All the passenger were killed?
1964.345,0,43452,theodore_e_wolcott,,136.213,151.863,"Yes sir, all passengers were killed, the crew was killed of the Viscount, the T-33 had just the pilot McCoy and a passenger and the only survivor was McCoy."
1964.345,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.622,171.884,The only question is whether or not McCoy was an agent of the United States within the meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act?
1964.345,0,43452,theodore_e_wolcott,,171.884,173.881,Yes sir.
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1916.628,1920.671,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.345,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.373,1978.192,"So under that argument if we accept, it's unnecessary to determine which of his two hats he was wearing at the time of this collision?"
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1978.192,1988.934,"Exactly, we think it's -- there is no rational basis for making the government's liability turn on the capacity in which he was acting at the particular moment."
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1993.276,2021.883,"Wouldn't that have some evidentiary value in a case of this kind or we do have sort of a mixed up situation, part state and part federal ownership and the federal government when this happens recognized clearly and consistently throughout it's departments that the man was a federal agent, it has -- it does have some well there --"
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2021.883,2022.219,We take --
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2022.219,2025.381,"MIt is not conclusive but it does have some bearings, does it not?"
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2025.381,2027.787,"Well, we take an alternative position Your Honor, which is that --"
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2027.787,2030.517,"Well I know, but how about that question?"
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2030.517,2039.384,"Well, I think that the federal government has taken the consistent position that these are state employees both the tech and as civilian capacity and in his military capacity."
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2039.384,2041.716,"You have in the courts, but have you in the departments --"
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2041.716,2042.484,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2048.48,2051.672,How about McCoy in this case?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2051.672,2052.204,Yes.
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2052.204,2053.329,Did they?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2053.329,2053.906,Pardon?
1964.345,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2053.906,2056.818,How about the treatment they gave Mr. McCoy?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2056.818,2061.862,"Well, there has only been one exception to this administrative interpretation and that's in regard to compensation."
1964.345,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.908,2074.963,[Inaudible] --
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2074.963,2075.288,No.
1964.345,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.288,2077.065,â€“ and the National Guard --
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2077.065,2086.77,"Exactly Mr. Justice White, they also grant compensation in certain circumstances to the guardsman acting in his military capacity, so there is --"
1964.345,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.77,2094.646,This is pursuant to a general statute applicable to National Guard officers?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2094.646,2107.168,"No Your Honor, it's under the Federal Employees Compensation Act and that has been interpreted by the bureau to extend to persons who receive pay, the bulk of their pay from federal sources."
1964.345,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.168,2110.369,That applies to National Guard military?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2110.369,2111.69,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.345,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.516,2133.952,But isn't there a statute which expressly says the compensation provision shall be applicable to these people or not or is that just an administrative interpretation?
1964.345,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2133.952,2136.806,That's just an administrative interpretation as I understand it Your Honor.
