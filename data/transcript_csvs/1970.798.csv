1970.798,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.61,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 798, United States against Mitchell and others."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,17.61,20.212,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.798,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,106.279,122.529,"Mr. Bray, could you tell me one detail, is the income of the community on which the deficiency was determined due to the wife’s earnings or income from her property at all?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,122.529,126.792,"In the Mitchell case, it was partially due to her earnings."
1970.798,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,152.264,154.296,This has to be your position necessarily.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,157.322,163.39,"Yes, sir and even before that, the split income cases in the 1930 term of this Court."
1970.798,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,270.82,276.013,"Mr. Bray, is that renunciation Louisiana provision common to all community properties?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,276.013,278.739,"It is not, it was common in the Spanish law."
1970.798,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,325.81,329.104,"By termination of the marriage, this would include death of the spouse?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,329.104,334.958,"That’s correct, in fact in these cases, one dissolution occurred because of death."
1970.798,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,334.958,336.613,Does it apply in the reverse?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,338.31,343.07,"No, the husband does not and this is because again originating from the Spanish law."
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.603,381.392,It is also for that same theory that there’s no way the rank could compel the “master” to pay?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,381.392,381.698,"Well, --"
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.698,383.316,Isn’t that a part of a theory?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,383.316,392.515,"Yes, that is part of a theory, but I would point out that there are protections for the wife while she can’t perhaps compel the husband to pay the taxes as such."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.804,448.069,"Now, as a practical matter, how can she possibly file a return?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,448.069,454.023,"As a practical matter, if indeed the husband is unavailable, she --"
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.023,459.666,"And that he is pretty available, he just tells us “it’s none her business.”"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,464.464,466.363,"No, not for both of them, just for her."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.363,468.495,"Well, in just for her, how much?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,468.495,469.74,She might report --
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.74,471.949,On her own income or her share of the community income?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,471.949,474.12,She must report her share of the community income.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.12,475.29,"Now, where does she know?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,478.08,482.058,This is of course the practical difficulty with which we’re faced in this Court.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.058,485.057,"Well, but you’re not faced with any practical difficulties, she is."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,485.057,490.002,"I beg your pardon, the practical difficulty of the wife which we must answer in this Court --"
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.002,490.857,"Well, how can she?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,493.064,499.103,"Under a state law, there is the possibility that she could compel her husband to give her this information."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.622,519.092,"But how could she ever protect herself from penalty, she can file a return and say, “I don’t -- my husband refuses to tell me what the community income is, but I have income on my own."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,525.231,526.993,"No, it would not be a complete compliance."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.074,553.025,Even though it was practically impossible for her to comply?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,553.025,555.881,"Even though it was practically impossible, yes sir."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.187,590.176,But fraud liability relieves her from.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,590.176,592.25,"Well, not only fraud but also from the tax liability."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.25,592.723,Does it?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,592.723,593.687,"Yes, sir it does."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.624,650.551,"Mr. Bray, isn’t the --"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,650.551,653.242,"Yes, sir."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.242,655.513,I’m going back to Justice White’s question.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,669.674,670.46,"Absolutely, --"
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.46,676.571,"Of course, it isn’t the same because she could file a separate return and avoid penalties directly?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,676.571,687.963,"That’s right and let me say that in that regard, while the present legislation has relieved the wife of liability in certain very limited circumstances, there are two important features of that."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,745.333,763.046,"In a common law state where a joint return is made and let’s say there’s an understatement of the income that’s negligent, non-fraudulent, non-criminal so that the -- there’s more taxes owing and that’s discovered."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,769.861,771.218,"No, in the community property state?"
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.218,772.575,"No, no, in the common state."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,772.575,775.358,"If a joint return has been filed in some, yes."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.358,775.725,Yes.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,775.725,778.758,Until the amendments of the statute in January of this year.
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.758,780.404,Each spouse can be held liable for the tax.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,780.404,780.824,That’s right.
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.952,794.626,"And unlike, as I understand it, you told us that in a community property state, the spouse is only liable for half the taxes?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,794.626,795.543,Absolutely.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.188,917.844,Mr. Bray.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,917.844,918.57,"Yes, sir."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.57,922.12,"Judge Ainsworth was a member of the panel in the Fifth Circuit, was he not?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,922.12,928.81,"Yes sir, he was and he dissented from the decision in both of these cases."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.81,929.499,Did he?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,929.499,931.73,"Well, I’m sorry, I think (Voice Overlap)."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.73,933.097,I think Judge Ainsworth dissented.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,933.097,934.228,Judge Ainsworth.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.228,938.965,"This is what bothers me, Judge Ainsworth is a Louisiana and --"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,938.965,939.716,"Yes, you’re correct."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.553,941.688,-- made the majority.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,945.475,945.689,No.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.817,960.182,The other two are Floridians and they split.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,960.182,964.599,"That’s correct and it continued to do so, I might add."
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.599,983.739,Still I have great difficulty Mr. Bray with the “master” not telling to wife anything in doling out a weekly allowance to him and you charged him with possessing something.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,983.739,988.722,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if I can say that we don’t charge her with possessing something."
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1003.542,1005.884,But how is she the owner?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1005.884,1006.321,She is the owner --
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.321,1008.651,Ownership has the right to dispose.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1008.651,1017.943,Well that -- this Court again in Poe versus Seaborn distinguished between management on the one hand which we acknowledged that the husband have.
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.943,1019.302,Bear ownership on them?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1019.302,1039.163,"And bear ownership on the other and I might add that in a subsequent dissent, Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out that this was the technical distinction made and that now, ownership determines who is liable for the taxes."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.54,1532.098,"Mr. Bray, does Texas have community property?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1532.098,1532.869,"Yes sir, it does."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.869,1533.634,You are a Texan.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1533.634,1536.195,"Yes sir, I am."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.195,1540.587,I’m still bothered by this renunciation provision.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1542.544,1545.473,"Yes sir, that’s correct."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.473,1554.275,"Is this one that can be exercise only after the community is dissolved, could it be exercised prenuptially for example?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1554.275,1575.281,"Alright, not under that provision but prenuptially the parties may determine not to be bound by the community property laws under Article 2399, which provides that absent on agreement, the marriage super induces a partnership of right between the spouses “unless, they otherwise agree.”"
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.302,1591.867,You do not have it in Texas?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1591.867,1600.578,"No, we don’t but I might add that the Fifth Circuit didn’t base its decision on renunciation per se."
1970.798,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1716.183,1718.989,"You’re struggling on hard cases factually, aren’t you?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1725.955,1737.853,"Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we can’t claim the equities in this case and we recognize that only too well, but we come here because we think the law is clear and has been for some 40 years now."
1970.798,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.896,1771.289,Is it very like you that you never get a case in this area that was not a hardship case?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1771.289,1787.945,"Not on this subject, I don’t believe we would, but I might point out that of course the wife as I mentioned earlier realizes some rather significant benefits under the community property laws which she doesn’t have in the common law states."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.817,1878.954,You read the hypothetical case on page 11 of the Angello brief?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1878.954,1880.164,"Yes sir, I did."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.164,1882.414,Which is true hardship case?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1882.414,1884.368,"Yes sir, it is."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.368,1891.091,And you agree that that would be the result in the hypothetical case if your argument is accepted do you?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1891.091,1895.199,Presuming that the funds there were legally obtained and I presume that they were.
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.199,1898.778,However obtained by hypothesis of the gambling tables in Las Vegas?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1898.778,1899.857,And I understand that to be legal.
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.857,1902.088,"$100,000.00"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1902.088,1918.26,"Then indeed, it would follow under -- what we consider to be the established law that she must report and pay the taxes on her one-half share of that $100,000.00 if a joint return or her husband’s separate return has not included that income earning."
1970.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.26,1937.844,"Well, by hypothesis, he went to Mexico with the paramour and then died soon thereafter and that she was left peni -- and squandered all the money and she was left penniless and then later inherited a little money from her father which she was using to support her children and under your argument the Government gets all that?"
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.844,1938.345,It was cut the same thing --
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1938.345,1941.089,"There’s no way I can get around that, yes."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.089,1947.429,"Can’t the same thing be said of the embezzlement cases, and I think Jones, the holding of this Court?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1947.429,1962.972,"Except as I try to say in the embezzlement area, historically at any right to community property law has not recognized the wife as the one-half owner of moneys illegally obtained by her husband."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.694,1984.999,But not in this one?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,1984.999,1986.689,"Not in this one, I’m sorry."
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.673,2046.636,"Will you give me a hypothetical thing, is there any instance you know in the tax law where somebody’s tax or some of the -- he never knew he had?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2046.636,2047.918,He never knew he had?
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.918,2048.708,Yes.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2048.708,2050.413,"Well, again I would presume --"
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.413,2052.364,They are so.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2052.364,2055.857,I would presume that a limited partner might not know what he had.
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2055.857,2057.556,That’s what I thought.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2057.556,2063.686,I would also presume that a beneficiary of a trust might not know what the trustee is doing.
1970.798,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.723,2081.871,That’s right and the partner who made the picks up a little money long since that what he’s going to pay.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2081.871,2083.29,Exactly.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.676,2092.087,"Yes, but the limited partner has remedies under local law."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2092.087,2092.875,"Well, certainly --"
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.875,2095.792,When you find out it impairs the partnership.
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2095.792,2104.985,"But Mr. Justice White, I might add that this would of course be after the fact just like it is in our case or in the hypothetically any rate would be."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.435,2108.739,"In case, she never finds out."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2108.739,2117.079,But she has after the fact remedies and she would certainly find out at the time the Government find out and made an assessment against her just as the wife here did.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.079,2118.131,And what did she do?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2118.131,2126.64,"She can sue the husband for -- now, I’m not as clear on Louisiana law on this as I am on California law because of the recent case."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.64,2128.122,"No, we’re talking about Louisiana."
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2128.122,2139.102,"Okay, it would be my understanding that Louisiana law is identical to California law on this subject and that is that the wife has a right over against her husband for his failure to pay community debts when he should have."
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.839,2161.269,"So, she is -- this woman now has an obligation as her husband?"
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2161.269,2162.46,Yes.
1970.798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.874,2163.71,Under Louisiana law?
1970.798,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,2163.71,2175.445,Under Louisiana law now again presuming limitations or something else doesn’t bar him from going after. Of course in Angello the husband is dead and the record would indicate that the estate is himself.
1970.798,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2215.606,2220.937,"Very well, Mr. Bray."
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2222.751,2226.276,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.798,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.725,2287.581,Does Louisiana have an income tax?
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2287.581,2290.431,It does Your Honor.
1970.798,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2290.431,2298.271,The problems are akin to this or they are just precise problem that ever arise in a state law -- state income tax?
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2298.271,2305.076,"I have never been able to find any record of it having occurred, made it inquires with the state revenue people."
1970.798,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2337.558,2340.378,How long has that been the law of Louisiana?
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2340.378,2349.938,"It has been a law of Louisiana, Your Honor, at least since it became a state and prior thereto under the Spanish and French."
1970.798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.938,2359.457,Then I take it you disagree with Mr. Bray’s inference to the contrary that she could compel him to disgorge her share of the income?
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2359.457,2361.57,I do disagree.
1970.798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.377,2386.689,"Well, that’s this situation, isn’t it?"
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2386.689,2396.458,"In this particular situation, Your Honor she had no separate property at the point that, which she might have ask for termination of the community."
1970.798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.727,2407.775,"Do you mean, he can’t terminate that even she can show that he is squandering her contribution in the community?"
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2407.775,2427.967,"Our courts have held that if the result of his squandering the community funds, is to make her support put in jeopardy and that she is working she might get a termination of the community so that her future earnings would be her separate property."
1970.798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.082,2445.75,(Voice overlap) both parties supported obligations to pay the tax.
1970.798,1,38042,paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr,,2445.75,2451.251,Our courts have not at this point interpreted support that broadly.
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4140.05,4143.876,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.798,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4286.205,4290.419,"And what do you say Mr. Schott, I missed it and it was my fault but I -- excuse me."
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4293.409,4293.779,Yes.
1970.798,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4293.779,4294.997,And what was that statement?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4294.997,4312.448,"That statement is “that the federal government taxes interests that are created by the state, but state law determines what those interests are.”"
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4496.473,4502.06,Would you say then the Government could collect the entire trans bill for the entire community from her husband?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4502.06,4518.411,I think that the logical extension of Louisiana community property law if it’s left understood in this case is that the husband owes all of the community income tax because the husband under Louisiana law does not have that same right than the wife.
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4518.411,4521.538,Does this require any modification of prior cases in this Court?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4521.538,4523.87,"No, I don’t believe it would Your Honor."
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4565.178,4573.2,But there no case or intimation in our cases that the Government may not collect the entire tax bill from the husband?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4573.2,4574.373,I find none Your Honor.
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4575.558,4576.341,How about the Malcolm case?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4576.341,4578.112,"No, Your Honor Malcolm is a case of course that he is --"
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4578.112,4579.662,Because number one the Malcolm case?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4579.662,4582.224,That is a per curiam decision and --
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4582.224,4583.267,Certified questions?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4583.267,4598.363,"That case was -- a case in which the husband and wife had filed a joint return and I think that does make all the difference in the world because in effect, the wife in signing the joint return makes herself automatically liable under the tax laws."
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4621.423,4632.466,"Well, is the end-result then of your position is that the husband should -- is responsible for the entire tax bill for the community?"
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4632.466,4633.246,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4633.246,4636.88,And the wife has no really substantial present interest in it?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4636.88,4638.081,"She doesn’t have anyway of controlling it, Your Honor."
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4638.081,4644.211,"And therefore, it should be no division of income for purposes of the tax rates?"
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4644.211,4655.086,If she has a sufficient interest under Poe and Bender in order to split the income for tax purposes but to say to the wife now that even though you’re renounce the community --
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4655.086,4665.253,Do you think that Louisiana law though still gives her or not of an interest so that the husband doesn’t need to pay as though he is a single taxpayer?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4665.253,4666.627,I think that it does.
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4774.845,4793.267,"Why shouldn’t we -- why shouldn’t the federal government take you seriously then to say to the husband when he says, when they try to collect from him all of the taxes at single taxpayer’s rates, why should the Government say, will you tell me that this doesn’t belong to the wife, she has no interest in it?"
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4794.562,4806.226,"Your Honor, certainly that the federal income tax laws could be amended so as to require the husband to pay all the taxes as Mr. Bray pointed out in his address to the Court."
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4832.29,4833.633,At the full rates?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4833.633,4835.37,"At the full rate unless, under the --"
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4835.37,4837.002,Full single taxpayer rate.
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4837.002,4846.656,That is correct except for the federal regulation which permit her to sign that joint return as she did in Malcolm and make herself liable for half of it.
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4858.053,4863.652,"Mr. Schott, help me a little bit with your renouncement argument."
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4872.009,4898.102,"Your Honor, in Louisiana a renunciation of the community by the wife is a peculiar aspect of our community property law which gives the right to the wife, the right to renounce not only the benefits of the community but also the obligations of the community to the extent that the community as far as she was concerned never existed."
1970.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4918.247,4919.828,What’s the difference?
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4919.828,4927.114,"Well, I think Your Honor as Mr.-- as my colleague pointed out I think that you are looking at a bundle of rights here."
1970.798,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4953.082,4954.037,Thank you Mr. Schott.
1970.798,2,38321,patrick_m_schott,,4954.037,4955.039,Thank you very much.
1970.798,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4955.039,4958.052,"Mr. Bray, you have about eight minutes left."
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,4958.052,4960.604,Thank you.
1970.798,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5309.984,5321.06,Why can’t the -- why couldn’t the Government’s theory -- the Government to collect the husband’s share for the -- even if the income of the wife’s set of property?
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5321.06,5326.786,Because the wife has no obligation on the husband’s -- on the taxes on the husband’s share of the income.
1970.798,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5326.786,5331.145,"You mean, it isn’t the same reason that you could collect?"
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5331.145,5335.142,"Well, certainly with respect -- yes to answer that directly yes."
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5343.815,5353.884,"That was if they, I suppose if a joint return is made in a community property state just as a matter of federal law of each spouse --"
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5353.884,5356.63,Each spouse is then jointly and severally liable and we can go after --
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5356.63,5357.549,For the whole bill?
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5357.549,5364.512,We can and go after either or both of them for all of the taxes and from any property they may own community or separate and of --
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5364.512,5366.459,So the rule is just a matter of federal law (Voice Overlap)?
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5366.459,5367.696,"That’s a matter of federal collection, Your Honor."
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5367.696,5369.346,If a joint return was made.
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5369.346,5370.26,"That’s correct, I think --"
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5370.26,5371.968,It’s not different from a common law state?
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5371.968,5378.022,That’s correct and I think the best case makes very clear that in that situation we’re not bound by a state exemption laws.
1970.798,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5378.022,5379.146,Right.
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5379.146,5391.833,But the characterization of the wife’s ownership is something less than sufficient for federal tax purposes is simply not with this Court has recognized or what the Louisiana courts have held time and again.
1970.798,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5423.472,5425.647,"If she is bound, can she sell it?"
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5425.647,5426.544,Can she sell it?
1970.798,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5426.544,5427.066,"Yes, sir."
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5427.066,5432.382,"Alright, she has no right to convey the property during the existence of the community."
1970.798,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5438.704,5442.888,"She doesn’t have ownership the way I understand ownership, does she?"
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5442.888,5443.254,"No, sir."
1970.798,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5461.515,5462.269,Thank you Mr. Bray.
1970.798,3,44034,william_terry_bray,,5462.269,5462.863,Thank you.
1970.798,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5462.863,5463.724,Thank you gentlemen.
