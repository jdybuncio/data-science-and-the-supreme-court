1983.82-282,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.066,We'll hear arguments next in McCain against Lybrand.
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,40.408,44.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.163,114.206,"Mr. McDonald, what was the nature of the 1966 change that you are describing?"
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,114.206,124.031,"The 1966 change instituted a three-member elected, at-large county council with additional home rule powers."
1983.82-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.24,334.402,"Mr. McDonald, what if the strictly factual question of did the Attorney General, in fact, evaluate the 1966 change was to be answered the way you said it should, no, he did not."
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,356.424,377.498,"I think if a belated submission had been made and if the jurisdiction had fully complied with the submission requirements that the Court has set out in Allen and the United States versus Board of Commissioners of Sheffield, and if the jurisdiction had made a specific, though late, request that the change could have been cleared."
1983.82-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.117,417.136,"Well, supposing that the 1971 change, just as you said, and I don't doubt it is, but it makes some reference to what happened in 1966."
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,435.027,437.749,"--Well, there was nothing ever submitted to--"
1983.82-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.749,439.8,"But, supposing that had happened."
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,439.8,448.094,"--Well, if it had been submitted and if it had been considered, then it could have been precleared, but it was not submitted."
1983.82-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.033,479.016,"It was also concluded as a matter of fact, didn't it?"
1983.82-282,0,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,479.016,482.218,--Which I believe to be patently erroneous on this record.
1983.82-282,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.239,780.912,Ms. Etkind?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,780.912,795.181,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-282,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.455,1197.135,"Ms. Etkind, if we agree with your presentation and conclude that Edgefield County never had the preclearance for the '66 election by virtue of the action in 1971, do we have to reach the second question--"
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1197.135,1197.826,No.
1983.82-282,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1197.826,1200.257,--raised on the '76 election?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1200.257,1200.718,No.
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1200.718,1203.159,May I ask this question?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1203.159,1203.75,Yes.
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1203.75,1212.126,Is it agreed that the 1966 Act was filed with the Attorney General while he was considering the Act of 1971?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1212.126,1213.497,It wasn't file.
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1218.34,1219.321,"So, he received it?"
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1219.321,1219.972,Yes.
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1219.972,1225.395,"And, what maps were made available to the Attorney General at that time?"
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1225.395,1233.669,I believe it was the map showing the three districts as set up under the '66 legislation and the three districts set up under the '71 legislation.
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1233.669,1235.039,May I ask this?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1257.966,1265.069,"As I understand it, the Attorney General does have that computerized system, but he didn't have it in 1971."
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1265.069,1269.313,No files that would have enabled him to check to see whether requests had ever been made?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1269.313,1281.862,"Well, there were files and he could have checked, but it is our submission that the burden was not on him to do that checking, and in view of the large number of submissions, that burden should not be put on him."
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1281.862,1283.462,How many submissions are made in a year now?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1283.462,1291.527,"Well, in 1982 he received requests for preclearance of more 14,000 changes."
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1291.527,1294.599,What does that work out per working day?
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1297.413,1306.425,"I believe there was a reference to that in Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion in the Port Arthur case, but I don't remember the exact figure."
1983.82-282,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1306.425,1307.647,Okay.
1983.82-282,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1307.647,1317.334,"It is our submission that because the change to at-large elections itself has never been subjected to scrutiny under Section 5, the Attorney General's objection should be in force."
1983.82-282,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.334,1325.109,Ms. Henderson?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1325.109,1334.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1494.961,1501.416,Was there any reason why the '66 one wasn't submitted?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1501.416,1503.329,"No, Your Honor, there isn't."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.643,1574.022,May I ask a question?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1580.748,1581.759,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.759,1582.678,That was a change?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1582.678,1583.67,"Yes, it definitely was."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.67,1591.056,"And, is it your position that that was implicitly cleared in '71 or it became unnecessary to clear it when you had a different scheme in '71?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1591.056,1603.352,Our position is it was superseded by the 1971 Act because the 1971 Act provides completely for the method of electing Edgefield County council.
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.352,1611.409,"So, you do not contend that the action in 1971, in effect, cleared the '66 change?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1611.409,1616.642,"We don't contend that it reached back or... Yes, reached back and cleared the '66--"
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.642,1625.146,"So, your position is that you... that clearance in '71 cleared the entire statute regardless of how many changes it made?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1625.146,1627.047,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.299,1634.023,"And, regardless of how many features of the statute were previous changes that had never been precleared."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1634.023,1636.063,"--Because of... Your Honor, that is correct."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.814,1655.968,"So, it really comes down to a question of who had the duty to find out how many changes there were."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1664.704,1665.643,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.643,1666.824,That is the whole fight.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1666.824,1692.721,"I think it is important to note that we were, back then in the early years of the Voting Rights Act, and it was not too long after the watershed case of Allen, and I think if we... I don't know that we even need to compare duties, but I think the Attorney General being charged with the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act probably has more knowledge of what it that was a voting change than Edgefield County did at that time."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.721,1694.493,May I ask this one other question?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1700.936,1715.986,"Yes, for this reason, and this is what I am getting into and that is we think that '71 Act precleared the present method of electing Edgefield County council by operation of law as well as in fact."
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.468,1788.945,Was the '66 law ever presented to the Attorney General for preclearance up until this moment?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1788.945,1792.496,"--No, Your Honor, it hasn't been."
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1807.997,1812.121,Do you mean that South Carolina has been relieved of its duty?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1816.523,1817.394,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.394,1820.056,And they have been excused of that?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1820.056,1833.592,"No, Your Honor, we think we have presented the present method of election in Edgefield County for preclearance in 1971 and that it was precleared in 1971 and there has been no change in the last 12 years."
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.874,1898.756,I thought you had said you had never submitted it.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1901.849,1905.812,--We submitted the present method of electing the Edgefield County council.
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.812,1906.683,"But, not the '66 one."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1906.683,1907.962,That is correct.
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.124,1913.825,Be careful when you say you are not including '66.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,1913.825,1917.258,"--No, Your Honor, I certainly am not including '66."
1983.82-282,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.448,2016.602,"You are saying then, Ms. Henderson, that the Attorney General took a different position in '71 than he did in 1980."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2016.602,2017.904,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.562,2514.621,"Ms. Henderson, under... I would think it is under your submission that if a locality, city or county or state passes a new ordinance or a new law and you just put it in the mail to the Attorney General and say, please clear this, that that clears every possible change that might be involved."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2514.621,2517.593,"No, Your Honor, that isn't our position."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.201,2532.152,"Well, all right."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2539.268,2542.118,"I think in 1971, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.118,2542.819,You just mail it.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2551.384,2551.905,No.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.826,2555.458,"Well, what were you supposed to do in 1971?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2555.458,2558.279,"--Well, we were supposed to submit it, which we did."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.279,2561.541,Submit the Act or the ordinance.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2563.001,2563.732,It was an Act.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.732,2565.304,"All right, it was an Act."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2567.064,2567.525,Okay.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.348,2589.42,"But, you did say something when you sent it in, didn't you?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2589.42,2589.991,--No.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.832,2600.397,"And, you didn't say what a change was or--"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2600.397,2600.918,No.
1983.82-282,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2612.485,2617.2,"--That is probably what led the Attorney General to write and ask for the '66 Act, isn't it?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2617.2,2618.229,"Yes, I imagine so."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.343,2683.962,"But, the Attorney General sent back and said... wants the '66 Act and then he decided that the change between... that the '71 Act effected as compared to the '66 was all right."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2685.442,2687.775,"--He precleared the '71 Act, Your Honor--"
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.775,2698.983,"But, your assumption also is that he also cleared the '66 Act as compared with the change... The change that was effected by the '66 Act."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2698.983,2706.155,--He precleared every provision of the 1971 Act when he precleared the 1971 Act.
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.866,2725.379,Where did you ever ask him to preclear the '66 Act?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2727.309,2730.382,The record reflects we have never submitted the '66 Act.
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.382,2733.243,"Well, how could he preclear it if you didn't ask for it?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2733.243,2734.335,He precleared--
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.335,2736.036,Under the statute.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2736.036,2750.915,"--Your Honor, that issue became moot when in 1971 the '66 Act was amended by striking out all of the election provisions, replacing them with new election provisions, and that was precleared."
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.389,2759.881,"Well, you a minute ago said it had been precleared."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2761.651,2764.573,"Well, as I have said--"
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.573,2772.48,You take the position that the '66 Act is precleared or it was mooted out by the '71 Act.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2772.48,2774.05,--It is mooted out by the '71 Act.
1983.82-282,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.05,2776.321,"And, you don't maintain it was precleared?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2776.321,2780.245,We do not maintain that it was ever submitted and we also--
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2780.245,2790.141,"Have any of the provisions of the 1966 Act been retained or were retained in the 1971 Act, any whatsoever?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2790.141,2790.812,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2790.812,2791.871,What were they?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2791.871,2799.228,The '71... Both the '71 Act and the '66 Act provide for at-large and for two-year terms of office.
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2799.228,2800.079,Yes.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2805.142,2807.743,And all five districts were changed.
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2807.743,2814.916,And all five districts were changed and maps were submitted that showed the districts that pre-existed '71?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2814.916,2816.098,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2816.098,2826.696,"Your position is that the 1971 Act, with those changes, has just completely supplanted the 1966 Act?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2826.696,2827.605,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1983.82-282,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.992,2848.589,"And, the basic criticism of the present statute is... well, both of the statutes, I suppose, was in theory the elections were at-large."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2848.589,2865.891,The 1979 objection to the ordinance and resolution states that the new powers assumed by the Edgefield County council in the context of at-large has the potential for diluting the black vote.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.852,2876.907,What was the law in existence prior to '66?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2876.907,2881.391,Prior to '66 there was an appointed--
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.391,2884.663,What was the date of the act that governed that?
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2884.663,2888.216,"--Oh, goodness, I think that goes way back into the--"
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.216,2890.187,"The Attorney General never asked for that, did he?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2890.187,2891.426,"--No, he didn't."
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.426,2897.79,"So, he didn't know... had no idea what the change of the '66 Act effected?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2897.79,2901.233,"Well, we think under... by operation of law--"
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.233,2902.445,He never asked you for anything before then.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2902.445,2902.975,--That is right.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.73,2915.582,He didn't have to compare it to the '66 Act with anything.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2919.074,2928.001,"--Well, he could only stop at the '66 Act if it had been precleared, because the determinative date is November 1st of '64."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.001,2929.343,"Well, that is not quite correct, is it?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2948.695,2955.189,"That is right, but when he precleared the '71 Act, he had the authority to look at all of them."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.464,2978.725,"But, under your view, a jurisdiction could pass a new law with a dramatic change in it and not submit it and the next year pass a carbon copy of the new law and say here is what the old one was and he would be presumed to have precleared the change he didn't know about."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2978.725,2979.576,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.004,2994.793,The amendment have a minor change.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,2994.793,2995.704,--Right.
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.934,3008.873,"But, if he didn't look at."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3029.656,3042.196,"--Your Honor, I think that under today's regulations and under today's standards of submission, we... He also can send back the submission and say follow our regulations."
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.196,3042.566,Yes.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3044.327,3044.897,Yes.
1983.82-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.897,3045.839,--then you win.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3045.839,3049.302,"We win on the Section 5, but, of course--"
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.302,3053.113,A fortiori you wouldn't win back in '71.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3059.678,3060.69,--That is right.
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.69,3068.204,"You do answer Justice Stevens, back in 1971 he was obligated to look back."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3068.204,3070.487,The Attorney General?
1983.82-282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.487,3071.526,Yes.
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3077.389,3078.321,That is right.
1983.82-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3105.869,3114.014,"Well, now, what is required for the voters to prevail under any of those alternative theories?"
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3114.014,3118.195,In the remaining issues?
1983.82-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3141.423,3148.016,"But if they can't show that, then there would be no relief under your theory."
1983.82-282,2,33843,karen_lecraft_henderson,,3148.016,3174.482,"--Your Honor, there is relief, and there is relief that... which is what I was talking about before... there is relief provided by state law, and that is the petition to change the method of election to single-member district by a referendum, and that takes merely a 10 percent petition, and the black voters of Edgefield County, according to the latest statistics, comprise 44 percent of the elected voters."
1983.82-282,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.499,3200.01,Very well.
1983.82-282,3,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3202.942,3208.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing further unless members of the Court have questions."
1983.82-282,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3208.456,3210.216,"No, apparently not."
