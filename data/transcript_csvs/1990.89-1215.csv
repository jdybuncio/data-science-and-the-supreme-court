1990.89-1215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.068,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1215, United Automobile Workers Union v. Johnson Controls."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,19.585,19.975,Ber-ZON.
1990.89-1215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,19.975,20.316,Ber-ZON.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,20.316,23.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.857,176.228,"Ms. Berzon, correct me if I'm wrong."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,192.128,194.3,Our... our--
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.3,200.453,It wouldn't matter for your analysis if the policy said a pregnant woman may not work in this unit.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,200.453,204.547,--That is true with respect to the broadest of the three propositions that we have before the Court.
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.547,211.101,"Indeed, it wouldn't matter if it said a woman more than... more than 4 months pregnant or 6 months pregnant would not work?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,211.101,214.624,That is true with respect to the broadest of the three positions that we have before the Court today.
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.135,218.116,The position that Judge Easterbrook took in the--
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,218.116,218.687,--That's correct.
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.451,293.629,--Are you saying that there would be reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives that would be much easier to identify if it were a policy that applied just to people that were pregnant?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,293.629,295.993,"Yes, because one could remove the people temporarily."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.894,310.044,Excuse me.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,327.377,329.157,"--Yes, but what I'm saying--"
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.157,329.708,Unlike that of--
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,329.708,338.486,"--is that if it isn't special treatment... that is, if men who have reproductive... possible reproductive harm as well as women who are pregnant are treated similarly as the OSHA--"
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.486,345.649,"--But it's special treatment with respect to all other workers who don't have that particular disability, if you consider it a disability, right?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,349.973,351.074,--That's... that's true.
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.82,421.824,"--Ms. Berzon, I have only one factual question, and maybe the record doesn't disclose it."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,428.128,428.94,We--
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.94,430.419,--or do we know much about that?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,430.419,438.617,"--We know that it is for some time period after a person is removed from lead exposure, and there are various estimates in the record."
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.685,455.589,"Well, on the first part of the equation, how many months are the estimates for the removal of the... of the contaminant?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,455.589,458.972,--Some of the estimates were two to three times as long as it took to build up.
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.15,513.692,Excuse me.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,519.207,523.552,"--The very last one I'm not sure would, because people can see who's pregnant."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.552,526.554,"Well, they'd know which woman was pregnant and which not pregnant as soon as she--"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,526.554,528.206,"Yes, but there are other ways to know which woman are... is pregnant."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.206,530.698,"--Well, eventually, but not... not... not too much."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,530.698,533.209,"That's true, but it seems to me to be substantially less severe."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.635,876.316,Excuse me.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,893.771,903.528,"It does prescribe in certain instances that certain people should be removed, at least temporarily, because of a medical problem."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.909,940.171,"Ms. Berzon, this is tied into that."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,984.302,988.616,"I think it well might, but I think that title VII itself prevents it, for the following reason."
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.38,1040.57,--I don't think that's how the suit would... would be framed.
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1054.014,1057.596,I would suppose that--
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.596,1062.3,Would OSHA preempt the State from establishing as a rule of tort law that you were negligent in not reducing your lead level even further?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1062.3,1068.726,--It would seem to me that it would be extremely good evidence as to what a reasonable person would do.
1990.89-1215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.143,1123.182,Ms. Berzon--
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1123.182,1131.178,It's as if the employer said I would rather have hired blacks because if I hire them I'm going to have to have... act toward them in a nonnegligent fashion.
1990.89-1215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.178,1139.874,"--Ms. Berzon, is there anything in the record to tell us whether insurance is available to the company against this perceived risk or, if so, how much it would cost?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1139.874,1141.924,There is absolutely nothing in the record that deals with that question.
1990.89-1215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.924,1145.818,Did they defend on the ground of potential tort liability?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1145.818,1161.589,"Not really, and the reason is because liability as such... that is, the cost that they might have to pay... they understand and we understand as a monetary factor cannot be a bona fide occupational qualification."
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1178.97,1197.123,"Well, I don't think it's bizarre to assume that a State court in a tort suit would impose very severe liability on an employer for knowingly placing the woman in the position where the fetus is injured if the fetus is actually injured."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1207.832,1209.621,--It's my position--
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.621,1212.903,--by reason of a decision that's in your favor here?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1212.903,1220.918,--That is precisely what a series of cases that this Court has affirmatively cited held--
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1220.918,1221.399,But is it your position--
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1221.399,1224.021,"--and it is my position, and it's also the employer's position, by the way."
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.021,1244.467,--So your... your position is that a failure to find a BFOQ and a requirement that the employer be placed... that the employee have the position should preempt any tort liability for any injury to the fetus?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1244.467,1247.359,"It's my position, and it is also the employer's position."
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1252.303,1252.995,"Not negligent, yes."
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1252.995,1253.502,--Yes.
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.166,1262.989,"So that in your position, the fetus should not be able to recover, or the newly born child, absent negligence?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1262.989,1263.41,That's correct.
1990.89-1215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.41,1268.412,"You'd allow recovery against the mother who... who put the fetus in that position, I presume?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1268.412,1276.63,"That assumes that the mother would be negligent if she put the fetus in that position, and, for the reasons that I stated earlier, that is an extremely unlikely context."
1990.89-1215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.272,1296.014,So there's... so there's no possible grounds for recovery for the injured child under your view?
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1296.014,1298.975,--I think that would be correct.
1990.89-1215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.832,1382.995,"May I ask you if you are asking for a judgment in your favor without a trial, or do you think the case should be tried?"
1990.89-1215,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1382.995,1389.16,"We do not move for summary judgment; and, therefore, the net result of a reversal would be a remand to the trial court."
1990.89-1215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.602,1395.036,"Thank you, Ms. Berzon."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1395.857,1400.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.122,1463.873,Let me just interrupt you there.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1466.556,1468.448,--The record doesn't give specific--
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.448,1471.62,It says it may poison some fetus some time.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1471.62,1493.224,"--The record indicates, Your Honor, that the studies, epidemiological studies comparing children and fetuses, mothers with... the cord blood of the mother... with different levels of lead, shows that an increasing quantity of lead in the system will cause deficiency and behavioral disorders, learning disabilities and other such problems--"
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.224,1499.187,"Right, and the question is, can you reduce the lead level enough so you can avoid that risk in a substantial number of cases?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1499.187,1500.018,--And the answer--
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.018,1506.031,"The answer... the record doesn't tell us how many cases there are, how many women work in the factory, or what the history has been, does it?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1506.031,1509.934,"--No, the record does show that the company attempted a voluntary program."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.048,1517.459,How many women?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1517.459,1520.434,--The exact number isn't in the record.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.823,1576.165,"May occur, or always occurs?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1576.165,1578.206,That it was an unsafe level.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.627,1580.61,"Well, why doesn't OSHA consider it an unsafe level?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1618.482,1624.156,--I think Congress has asked the district courts to do that in adopting the bona fide occupational qualification defense.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.156,1624.286,Well--
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1624.286,1624.727,This Court--
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.727,1638.487,"--Maybe if we accept your interpretation of it, Congress has, but one thing that makes me reluctant to accept your interpretation is that very fact, that it puts us in a very unusual position of becoming medical experts on some very difficult questions."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1638.487,1646.835,"--But prior decisions of this Court, such as Criswell and Dothard, in the bona fide occupational qualification field, have certainly put the district courts in that position."
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.835,1648.454,"Well, what about OSHA?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1653.72,1660.613,"OSHA, as the statute makes clear, sets a floor, not a ceiling, for occupational health."
1990.89-1215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1700.219,1728.699,"Mr. Jaspan, I... it seems to me that you are not coming to grips with the effect of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act... the PDA... which says that female employees affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes as other persons not affected but similar in their ability or inability to work."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1755.245,1757.007,Let me address both issues--
1990.89-1215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1757.007,1757.157,Yes.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1757.157,1757.648,--Justice O'Connor.
1990.89-1215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.988,1821.235,But I thought the policy reviewed here applies to women who are not pregnant and--
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1821.235,1825.057,The purpose of the policy is to protect the health of the fetus.
1990.89-1215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1825.057,1827.447,--Who can... who can perform the work.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1827.447,1851.854,"This Court in Criswell made clear that a bona fide occupational qualification defense is available when all, or substantially all, of the employees cannot perform the job safely, and also when the employer is unable to determine which employees in the excluded class possess the trait that creates the safety problem."
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.069,1886.408,"Mr. Jaspan, in interpreting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, as you just have, that is, as making an exception, or considering it part of the job qualification that you not harm the fetus' health... it seems to me you're making a dead letter of it."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,1913.148,1915.54,"Well, Justice Scalia, with all due respect, I disagree."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.991,2051.12,"Mr. Jaspan, can I ask this."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2083.005,2084.878,"No, it's not, and we haven't suggested that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.878,2087.059,How do you... how do we decide what's enough?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2087.059,2095.837,"I think in this case there was no reason for the courts to address it because the parties stipulated, conceded at the court of appeals... it's in the petitioners' brief... that there was substantial risk."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.837,2099.266,"Well, it's a substantial harm when it occurs."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2108.303,2116.621,"I believe you're wrong on that, because the court, the district court and the court of appeals adopted the existing case law from the Fourth and Eleventh Circuit."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.145,2148.636,"Well, how--"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2148.636,2149.858,--I think that their concession went beyond that.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.35,2161.037,"--Well, I'm still concerned about it, because if we approve the result of this case, what are we saying about the frequency that would cross the threshold?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2164.129,2180.021,"I think what we're saying is that a court in evaluating what is the first prong, as recognized by all the parties, and it's recognized by the lower courts that have addressed the issue, must determine whether the risk is so substantial that whether it... in terms of the severity and the frequency and has to measure both."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.624,2198.816,Who got pregnant but no evidence that... that the fetuses were harmed.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2198.816,2199.077,No.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.209,2203.321,"Right, but there is no evidence--"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2203.321,2203.642,--30 milligrams.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.742,2205.605,--There is no evidence that their children were harmed.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2205.605,2205.996,--That's not true.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.343,2218.244,"One of them was not a totally normal child, but he didn't say it was totally attributable to this cause, did he?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2218.244,2233.083,"--And what he did say is we're dealing with an... epidemiological studies that are the basis for the entire concern with childhood lead, is that if a child's IQ is reduced by 10 or 20 points, we don't know... if it's reduced, we don't know what it would have been."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.614,2264.608,"Well, does that one case... identify the severity of the danger that we're talking about?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2264.608,2266.02,--I don't think the single case does.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.655,2302.204,"Well, they... they should... women... women in that condition should not smoke cigarettes and drink substantial amounts of alcohol, either, but the Government does not have laws that take the judgment of whether to do it or not away from them."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2310.401,2317.574,"I don't know the exact comparison, Your Honor, but there's a difference here between the Government prohibiting it and insisting that a... private employer do it."
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.198,2335.707,Or make an exception from the employers... from the prohibition of the employers otherwise controlling the... the lives of the employees by prohibiting them from employment.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2356.38,2359.414,And I... I agree with you on that point.
1990.89-1215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.582,2377.488,Do you take the position that you could refuse to sell cigarettes to pregnant women employees?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2377.488,2379.369,Certainly.
1990.89-1215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.162,2386.841,"No, but that wasn't my question."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2387.883,2391.195,Could it single out pregnant employees?
1990.89-1215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2395.688,2400.943,"No, it's in your company cafeteria and it's been done for 20 years, let's assume."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2400.943,2403.605,--An assumption that's not true.
1990.89-1215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.038,2408.019,You assume they could--
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2408.019,2410.03,"They could prohibit that sale, and I think--"
1990.89-1215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.03,2412.741,--I think that's consistent with the theory of your case.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2412.741,2413.883,--And that's why I suggest that.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.214,2447.267,Surely not if the Government made them do it.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2451.521,2455.464,It arguably should be a defense.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.956,2553.512,"--Mr. Jaspan, is lead level in the ambient air something that can be monitored constantly, like temperature or humidity or something like that, or is it you have to--"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2553.512,2559.926,"It's monitored on an individual... on an 8-hour time-weighted average basis, so it can be monitored daily."
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.119,2569.106,--But you don't look... you can't look at the instrument at 6:00 and say the lead level has now reached a point where we've got to get out of the plant or something like that?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2569.106,2569.506,--No.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.479,2581.347,Is an average rather than a... than amount at a fixed point in time.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2581.347,2581.897,--Yes.
1990.89-1215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.782,2583.499,I see.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2583.499,2587.984,But we're dealing not only with the engineering controls this company put in but the biological monitoring.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.336,2647.688,"Mr. Jaspan, suppose we agree with your theory."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2676.43,2677.842,I think the--
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.842,2680.184,The workplace is full of risks.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2688.141,2690.345,--I think the language of the statute talks about reasonably necessary.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.213,2715.532,This doesn't sound... I'm not talking about the medical evidence.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2726.784,2729.927,--I don't think that we can put a precise number.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.252,2740.776,I'm just trying to figure out how courts are going to manage this... this rule that you're urging us to take onto ourselves.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2748.532,2751.834,"--I think that it's going to depend on the specific facts, but there's no percentage--"
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2751.834,2753.636,"Well, I know that, but I don't know what standards we apply."
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2753.987,2761.303,"--Well, I think the standards we should talk about is substantial risk and whether it's reasonably necessary for the particular operation and to provide the safety--"
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.303,2762.775,--It has to be substantial risk?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2762.775,2764.315,--I think in most cases--
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.315,2765.987,So one... one in a million wouldn't be enough?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2765.987,2767.618,--I don't know where the numbers would fall.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.089,2768.299,I see.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2773.805,2778.429,"--Justice Scalia, I think what we'd have to do is look in terms of the individual fact situation."
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.092,2813.184,He has to make those decisions.
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2813.184,2827.446,"--That's right, and I think in this case we are so far beyond where that line should be drawn, as both parties conceded, that it's not an issue that this Court has to face in this case, and it's not an issue that the district court or the court of appeals needed to face because it was a conceded issue here."
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.859,2884.721,Does this appear in the... in the materials that we have here?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2885.823,2887.282,--It is referenced in the brief.
1990.89-1215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.544,2892.946,It's not set forth anywhere in any of the papers?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,2892.946,2893.087,--No.
1990.89-1215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.994,3011.519,"Well, if it's a motion for summary judgment, how much... what is the effect of placing the burden of proof on something like that?"
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,3011.519,3025.258,"--In this case it would not have any effect, Your Honor, because in this case the Court addressed it both with the burden of proof on the plaintiffs under their interpretation of business necessity in light of Wards Cove and burden of proof on the employer in bona fide occupational qualification."
1990.89-1215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3037.707,3040.011,Even though the burden of proof was on the defendant?
1990.89-1215,1,41541,stanley_s_jaspan,,3040.011,3045.276,"In either case, because a rational trier of fact could not come to that... that conclusion, it wouldn't make any difference where the burden is."
1990.89-1215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.584,3130.745,"Thank you, Mr. Jaspan."
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3133.516,3135.537,Several comments.
1990.89-1215,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.421,3241.051,"Of course, on what you... on the basis of what you've just... we would have a different case, in other words, if the employer adopted a different policy which simply said as soon as... as soon as you are pregnant you are out of this job?"
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3241.051,3246.905,"--On... on that aspect of... that defect in their BFOQ policy, yes."
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.698,3299.621,Did you... did you move for summary judgment?
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3299.621,3301.862,"We do not move for summary judgment, and we are not asking--"
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.862,3303.682,What do you think our judgment should be here?
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3305.244,3307.165,"--Yes, to get it back to the district court."
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.165,3307.546,For a trial?
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3307.546,3314.492,"At that point, it appears that we... we would look at the record, and we would decide whether to... for us to move for summary judgment at that point."
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.782,3328.092,"Of course... of course, if we agree with your first argument, I suppose summary judgment would be... would... you would have good ground for summary judgment?"
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3328.092,3331.632,"--That's right, but we also think we would have good ground for summary judgment in our other two arguments as well--"
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.632,3331.822,"Yes, I know."
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3331.822,3332.213,--because--
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.213,3336.638,It would be a foregone conclusion under your first position--
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3336.638,3338.247,--I think that is probably correct.
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.629,3344.033,"--So in effect, we would be saying as a matter of law you're entitled to judgment in the case?"
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3344.033,3348.235,"--Yes, but the... the actual disposition would simply be a remand."
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.235,3349.957,To trial... for trial?
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3349.957,3351.908,To the trial court for further proceedings.
1990.89-1215,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.908,3354.419,"Yes, to find the... all right."
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3354.419,3379.727,"I was going to say that the... so on the one hand, this... the standard which Johnson Controls is arguing does not factor in any comparative risk notion or any reason why an employer cannot insist upon perfect protection for fetal health while not protecting adult health perfectly, not to say adequately, but not perfectly."
1990.89-1215,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.159,3489.481,"Thank you, Ms. Berzon."
1990.89-1215,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3489.481,3490.683,--it would agree with that proposition.
1990.89-1215,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3490.683,3490.863,Your time has expired.
