1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.535,"We will hear arguments next in number 5045, Lindsey against Normet."
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,65.028,68.26,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,120.217,122.384,Those photographs are in the appendix?M
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,122.384,123.009,"No, they are not."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.451,173.803,Would your case be any different if this was a 25-year-old professional football player in the peak of physical condition and health?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,173.803,177.187,In some respects it might and some respects it might not.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.821,182.234,Constitutionally?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,182.234,190.911,"Yes, some aspects of the case would make a difference because of the indigency and ability to search for a home."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.434,198.75,"Let us make him an unemployed professional football player that is indigent, then it would --"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,198.75,202.515,"Constitutionally, it would make no difference."
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,241.209,245.429,"Mr. Clough, is always general material in the record?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,245.429,246.288,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,286.496,295.247,At anytime in the course of these proceedings was there a tender of the rent into the custody of the Court?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,295.247,312.666,The Court had the option and the Court preferred -- the tender was offered at the institution of the proceedings and the court preferred that we as their attorneys keep the money in our escrow account and specifically condition to temporary restraining order based upon that.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,312.666,317.755,"Well, then it was really in the custody of the Court because you were holding it as an officer of the Court?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,317.755,320.254,That is correct.
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.531,392.232,But this did not actually happen to the Lindseys?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,392.232,392.748,No.
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.748,398.379,"They filed this action to the District Court before alleging that they were threatened with this, is that right?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,398.379,399.812,That is correct.
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,519.217,522.051,"Mr. Clough, how old are the Oregon statutes?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,523.996,540.032,"The last time that the FED, the eviction law was changed in any matter was in 1909, although the case of Friedenthal v. Thompson goes into a historical analysis where they were in effect back in the middle 1800s."
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,540.032,545.732,Has there been any endeavor to change the statute legislatively?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,545.732,550.266,"There has been an effort yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,550.266,577.244,I just wonder if one could say that possession of the premises during the controversy such as you envision here with the Lindsey’s is a matter at issue and that your legislature has come down on the side of the landlord rather than the side of the tenant in deciding a policy question?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,579.201,581.681,"No, I do not, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,581.681,588.081,But do you for the first time in the century are raising question?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,588.081,596.583,"The question has been raised, Mr. Justice Blackmun in several cases that have gone up to the Oregon Supreme Court on various aspects."
1971.70-5045,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,630.569,636.386,"Of course you could have resolved this dilemma by appropriate legislation, could you not?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,636.386,660.69,"Of course, that would be a very welcome response, but the legislature of Oregon has not seen as to do so and our -- one of the main lines of attack that we have here on the statute is due process which -- that does not matter that the statute either procedural like constricts the courts and the litigants so that the it dives in due process or it does not."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.526,732.338,Do you object to paying in the Court the rent while the action is going on?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,732.338,736.319,"Not at all, as long as it becomes due."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.319,736.457,"Yes, I understand."
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,736.457,740.207,"Because of the indigent tenant, but there is no objection to that."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.207,744.074,And you do object to paying it to the landlord?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,744.074,745.216,If the situation is such --
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,745.216,747.691,"It is what the case is all about, I guess?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,747.691,752.902,"Yes, it is the case is what as such lends itself, that paying it to the landlord would defeat the whole purpose."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.902,759.738,But you could sue the landlord in an independent action on an attempt to collect for breach of the lease or something?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,759.738,768.078,"That is true, but would not, that action would not stay this proceeding and that the whole issue here --"
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.078,777.611,"But you are not giving as rights under the Oregon Law, you do not give up any right to sue the landlord in you own action, I gather?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,777.611,782.118,"Not in an independent action for contract, but the issue here is possession of the premises."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.118,782.775,I understand.
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,782.775,785.349,And that is the key issue that the tenant is interested in.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.349,790.711,"Well, he can retain possession by paying the rent to the landlord?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,790.711,795.071,"By continuing to pay the rent of the landlord, but then it defeats this whole purpose."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.071,803.729,"Well, it does defeat anything if you -- what does it defeat, if you can nevertheless recover what you paid in the possession?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,803.729,809.554,The problem -- the problem with that is it forces every tenant into litigation.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.654,815.493,"I know that, but you concede that pending litigation you have to pay the rent anyway?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,815.493,816.624,But even --
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.624,817.57,You pay in the court.
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,822.011,823.307,That is quite correct.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.713,837.895,"You are paying the money, you are being separated from the rent as it falls due and you are going to be separated from it as long as the issue between you and the landlord is settled?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,837.895,842.821,"And you will also be separated from your property, if the landlord decides to (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.821,846.216,"Not as long as you pay the rent in the Court, you are not being dispossessed?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,846.216,855.484,"He could give a 30-day notice in retaliation for your invoking the Court procedures and what this action would do, would force them to involve the --"
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.484,867.48,"Well, I have seen -- If I do not understand when the landlord brings this action, this forcible entry and detainer action against the tenant?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,867.48,868.482,Yes.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.482,872.566,"Now, the tenant can retain possession if he pays rent in the Court?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,872.566,875.514,Only for the time of the continuance.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.514,876.012,Yes.
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,876.012,880.875,If he gets a continuance and it must be cash in advance.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.051,895.165,What do you mean get a continuance?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,895.165,901.107,"A continuance of hearing, the possessory action, the action for eviction."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.107,903.707,What does he actually have to put out to get the continuance?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,904.901,907.32,That would vary depending on how much time he has.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.32,912.506,Suppose he does not have any money that any rent that he is in default on in the first place?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,912.506,919.297,"Well, presumably under our situation he would have that money that if he were in default on it and there will no objection to that."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.297,924.498,"And then his rent falls due, he would have to put up the money?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,924.498,927.233,"We would have no objection to that, but that is not the way to that statute operates."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.233,928.64,So how does it operate?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,928.64,930.501,You have to put up cash in advance.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.815,944.443,"Mr. Clough, I seem to have missed something."
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,969.041,971.063,"No, it does not, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.063,973.603,My first impression was correct then?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,973.603,975.257,Your first impression was correct.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,981.128,982.082,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,982.082,984.912,"That was the three-judge court, yes."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.912,997.846,And would you think that was a reasonable condition uniformly to be attached to any right to maintain possession?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,997.846,1001.111,Perfectly reasonable or some variation.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.345,1017.675,"If you did not have that deposit in escrow, might you not be confronted, whether a counter suggestion that this was a taking of property without --"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1017.675,1018.261,Of course.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1018.261,1022.175,-- taking of the landlord’s property without due process and without compensation?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1022.175,1023.048,That is correct.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.048,1027.748,So that you would accept that as an invariable condition to maintaining possession?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1027.748,1032.606,"Yes, we would have no problems with that whatsoever."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.281,1290.614,"Would you be here if that were 20 days, Mr. Clough?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1290.614,1297.24,"If that were 20 days, probably not on that issue."
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.961,1310.895,"Well, what are the defenses available under the Oregon System just that payment is one, is it not?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1310.895,1311.816,Payment is one.
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1312.378,1314.988,Is there is anything else?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1314.988,1337.371,"There are certain equitable types of defenses such as showing that agreement between the parties was something aside from what its apparent nature was and their true relationship was not that of landlord-tenant such as, a deed is really a mortgage, and therefore, the eviction procedure should not be used, the Oregon procedure should be used (Voice Overlap)."
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.371,1346.749,Or that what appears to be a tenancy at will; might be month-to-month or what appears to be a month-to-month might be an actual lease for a year or something like that?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1346.749,1351.74,No those would still be landlord-tenant and they will still be (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.74,1355.487,"Is that available as a defense that, is what I mean?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1355.487,1377.587,"That the lease, that there is in fact a lease for year, a written lease that may be it depends depending on the circumstances of the case, but again we are dealing with that fourth item in the complaint with landlord’s right to the possession, not the third item which we are concerned with raising any contractual defenses."
1971.70-5045,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1377.587,1382.586,My thought was that it cannot be both ways.
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1399.129,1404.554,Like the time is contingent upon the ability to raise its defenses of course.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.554,1429.961,"Can I ask you if the, in the FED suit in response to it, you could not only claim that you are not in default, but that the statute itself is unconstitutional and have -- get a constitutional decision in that case and if you did afford the appeal bond, appeal any rejection of your constitutional ground?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1429.961,1434.591,In theory that (Voice Overlap) that would be available.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.591,1440.373,"Well, now this FED suits were pending at the time you went to the Federal Court, were they not?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1440.373,1443.962,"Some of them, there is none filed in the Lindsey case."
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.962,1445.32,But they were in the others?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1445.32,1450.61,There were three others and for various reasons those three cases settled and were never appealed.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.61,1462.129,"And what if the case of controversy between the one person in that landlord,l had he threatened the eviction or what?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1462.129,1467.202,The case in controversy is that he threatened eviction into invoke the use of the Courts.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.202,1468.639,But he never did?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1468.639,1471.215,But he never did because of this action.
1971.70-5045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.215,1472.194,I see.
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1472.194,1475.148,Because there was a restraining order issue in this action.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1475.148,1504.19,"Let us back-up to a case where there is a tenancy from month-to-month and for reasons not disclosed the landlord decides he wants to terminate the tenancy and gives the appropriate notices and at the end of the notice period, the tenant declines to leave, claiming that it is very inconvenient, there is no other housing available, etcetera."
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1519.018,1522.582,Not in the fact situation Mr. Chief Justice that you gave to me.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1522.582,1527.695,"In other words, in that situation the landlord can evict the --"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1527.695,1528.569,He would have no defense.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1528.569,1529.573,There would be no defense?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1529.573,1544.114,"However, if he were raising the defense that he should be entitled to at least raise and be heard on a defense that the landlord is evicting for example in retaliation, puts testimony in, but that is not the fact --"
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.114,1559.529,"Or if he has a one year lease or the things that Mr. Justice Stewart was talking to you about in alternative, that if you have a clear case of that kind where there is no valid defense, then you concede that the landlord can evict --"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1559.529,1566.295,"Of course, there is no denial of due process because the defense has not been raised."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.295,1570.404,Then the two days would not be a problem for you in that circumstance?
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1570.404,1576.524,"Yes, but the statute is over inclusive because it includes all of these other situations too."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1584.949,1593.84,"Well, then you come down to a claim of unconstitutionality of the statute as applied rather than facially, it that not right?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1593.84,1598.81,It would be on its face because the statute is over inclusive on its face.
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.81,1603.79,"I suppose six of one-and-a-half dozen of the other has applied with the specific case, is it not?"
1971.70-5045,0,29597,john_h_clough,,1603.79,1607.337,"It might be merged to both, yes."
1971.70-5045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.332,1612.636,Very well.
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,1617.463,1621.958,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.163,2008.455,"As I understand it, under Oregon Law the landlord is not permitted to join with FED complaint, any other claim eg a claim for the payment background or anything, is that correct?"
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2008.455,2023.446,"Mr. Justice that is correct and if he does join, he can join an action for rent if he wishes to do so or for any other action that might be joinable under our statute."
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.446,2024.159,But then if he does?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2024.159,2031.933,"But if he does then the FED procedure is not followed, the summary procedure is not followed --"
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2031.933,2032.65,It becomes (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2032.65,2057.3,"-- and the case is subject to the ordinary trial of procedure and instead of a the two to four days for which the summons would state, it would be 10 days observed in the county, 20 days in any other county where the individual did not actually reside."
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.3,2060.103,And it becomes just like any other contract action?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2060.103,2067.92,"Yes, sir and in any and all defenses, including counter claims, could be raise then in the action."
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.788,2072.851,If the plaintiff joined anything except the eviction?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2072.851,2074.463,"Yes, that is correct."
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2075.308,2078.993,Then defenses would be available and it would become an ordinary lawsuit?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2078.993,2079.9,Yes.
1971.70-5045,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.9,2082.657,This summary procedure will no longer take place?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2082.657,2089.148,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1971.70-5045,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.649,2290.906,Pay it in the Court?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2290.906,2296.754,"There is no provision, Mr. Chief Justice for the payment of the rent into Court."
1971.70-5045,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2303.298,2305.49,Would not the Court have inherent power to do that?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2305.49,2306.904,I believe that it would be.
1971.70-5045,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2312.215,2313.639,It happened in this case though?
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2313.639,2314.57,"No, it did not."
1971.70-5045,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2314.57,2316.75,It was in the Federal Court.
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2316.75,2330.552,And the thing about this case is that there was no FED eviction commenced by Mrs. Normet against the Lindseys.
1971.70-5045,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.907,2350.871,"But I thought that it led from lawyers to the Lindseys threatening a lawsuit, is that correct?"
1971.70-5045,1,42888,theodore_b_jensen,,2350.871,2365.674,We have -- I think that a counsel would agree with me that we have a different interpretation of the notice that was sent by Mrs. Normet’s attorney to the Lindseys.
1971.70-5045,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.17,2377.652,May I see it?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3616.24,3618.833,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3739.092,3762.591,Within the framework of this case the issue is I suppose could this statute hypothetically be saved by saying that Oregon was give the same time to answer in these cases as in any other civil action by reference to the particular statute governs that the 10 or 20-day statute?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3762.591,3765.903,You mean by a construction of the statute?
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3770.323,3773.29,"But you want 10 or 20 days, do you not?"
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3773.29,3778.047,Whatever reasonable enough period of time in order to --
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3778.047,3789.494,You have conceded earlier this morning that conventional statutory time to answer in actions in Oregon of 10 to 20 days was a reasonable time you were making an argument --
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3789.494,3790.7,Oh! Yes.
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3790.7,3793.43,"Well, then if you got that, you would be satisfied, would you?"
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3793.43,3795.333,On the time limitation.
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3795.333,3797.244,I am not suggesting it can be done that way.
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3800.511,3802.885,"On the time limitations, that would be true."
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3802.885,3804.56,And that would dissolve this whole case?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3804.56,3805.61,"No, it would not dissolve this whole case."
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3805.61,3807.084,What else would remain?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3807.084,3814.331,That the ability to raise defenses would still remain and the double-rent bond on appeal and the continuance bond.
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3827.507,3830.823,Do you know how this double-rent bond on appeal actually works in practice?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3830.823,3833.513,"It is an open-ended bond, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3843.349,3846.628,How many appeals have there been and how many --?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3846.628,3859.459,"We have the Oregon cases that are listed in the brief, Scales v. Spencer and Priester v. Thrall specifically dealing with the double-rent bond on appeal and describe how it operates."
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3874.891,3877.116,Scales against Spencer and what are the others?
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3877.116,3882.823,"Scales v. Spencer, Priester v. Thrall involve the double-rent bond on appeal."
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3917.28,3925.875,"Mr. Clough, did I understand Mr. Jensen to say that equitable -- all equitable remedies were available?"
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3925.875,3932.772,"I believe that is what he has implied, but that is not the case under Oregon Law."
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3933.36,3937.344,"How do we find that out except by reading those cases, do those cases reveal it?"
1971.70-5045,2,29597,john_h_clough,,3937.344,3941.721,Those cases reveal it and an analysis of the statute.
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4015.763,4016.555,Thank you Mr. Clough.
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4016.555,4019.963,"Priester versus Thrall, I cannot the find the list in your brief."
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4021.814,4025.636,It is listed in the appellee’s brief.
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4025.636,4027.615,"How do you spell Priester, begins with a P?"
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4027.615,4030.063,"Priester, P-R-I-E-S-T-E-R."
1971.70-5045,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4030.063,4030.612,Thank you.
1971.70-5045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4030.612,4031.811,Thank you.
