2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.454,"We'll hear argument now on No. 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. versus Lasting Impression, Inc.--"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,11.229,14.572,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,51.436,55.068,"You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,55.068,56.842,--Yes.
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.387,98.453,"In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,98.453,100.682,--This was a motion for summary judgement.
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.682,108.212,And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,108.212,112.57,"Yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion."
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.028,140.784,"Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,140.784,145.802,"--Well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.311,168.177,"Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,169.124,188.61,"Well, the thing is, a lot of times when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the confusion illustrates that... one of the elements of the fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements are being met."
2004.03-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,196.412,198.846,"Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,239.508,244.46,"--Yes... well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense."
2004.03-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,244.46,248.425,"--Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,249.911,251.192,"No, I wouldn't go that far."
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.872,288.018,"Well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,289.687,293.469,"--No, I wouldn't go that far, because you also have to look at the objective use."
2004.03-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.469,305.107,"I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,308.534,311.672,"Well, I think... I was reading the amici brief last night."
2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.623,345.952,What did... what did the district court do here?
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,349.651,353.821,"The... well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.31,371.282,But the district court... the district court... this way--
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,417.524,418.1,"--Yes, that is correct."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.929,429.617,--And it might not have been confusion just by using the word.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,436.138,439.36,"Well, in the abstract case, it could be."
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.73,457.315,"Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,460.37,461.113,--Correct.
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.113,474.033,"I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied ""fairly and in good faith"" if it didn't consider the logo-like use."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,489.265,490.713,"Yes, I would agree."
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.713,493.518,Is that... I'm... and I'm mixed up.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,500.289,503.056,"Yes, I think--"
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.056,503.056,So as far as--
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,503.056,504.132,--I think we're both saying the same thing--
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.132,515.111,"--So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,517.917,519.115,"--No, I agree."
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.115,519.298,No.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,527.742,528.57,Absolutely.
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,528.57,529.935,"That's where we are, is that right?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,529.935,530.557,That's exactly--
2004.03-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.557,530.678,Okay.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,530.678,531.3,--where we are.
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.3,549.876,"Could you give us a... I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,552.105,554.167,In my particular case?
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.827,555.364,No.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,556.767,557.222,--Okay.
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.222,558.17,--that's really clear.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,558.17,561.226,"Let's use the words ""best buy""."
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.628,583.329,"I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,584.405,585.641,Well--
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.641,590.099,"--what if he just takes out an ad that says, ""Best Buy"", exclamation point?"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,591.935,603.391,"--Okay, in that case there would be confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using ""best buy"" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair-use defense."
2004.03-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.387,611.747,I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,618.502,622.422,"--Well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark."
2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.82,639.223,"Well, but if you had a... if you had a headline at the head of an ad, ""Great Sale"", that surely is not a trademark, just because you have it in boldfaced print."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,639.223,641.741,"I agree, it's not necessarily a trademark."
2004.03-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.546,662.546,"I suppose if you have a sign that says ""Park 'n Fly"" and an arrow, with a capital ""P"" and a capital ""F"", then it's arguably being used as a trademark."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,662.546,663.949,Well--
2004.03-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.949,665.063,"Whereas, if you say in a brochure,"
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,669.521,681.222,"--Yes, but I'd go even further and say that the... if you had a big sign that said ""Park 'n Fly"", and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.927,707.666,"The Ninth... the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,746.554,749.359,They do it.
2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.871,808.68,"Well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a Lindy Pen case, according to... the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,808.68,814.169,"--Right, and that's... that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.169,817.53,They do have one authority for that proposition.
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,822.881,828.165,"Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.165,833.632,"But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,833.632,840.591,"Well, there are other treatise writers... Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if--"
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,842.633,847.939,So does the... what is it... the unfair competition restatement?
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,847.939,854.914,"Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time."
2004.03-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.097,909.694,"But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed."
2004.03-409,0,36306,michael_machat,,909.694,910.271,Yes.
2004.03-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.047,971.283,"Very well, Mr. Machat."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,973.141,986.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1104.825,1105.939,"Well, does... does consumer--"
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1116.259,1118.116,"--Not by itself, no, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.776,1158.24,"Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non... the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides,"
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1168.188,1178.591,"Yes, because there's nothing, in the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business and to do better and to use descriptive terms descriptively to do that."
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.534,1179.989,But what--
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1179.989,1180.36,--continued here--
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.36,1185.19,--what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion?
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1187.669,1192.515,"--The good-faith element is, do I intend... it depends on what you mean by ""causing confusion""."
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.412,1197.662,Yeah.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1197.662,1198.527,--meaning of the term--
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.527,1199.148,Right.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1199.148,1201.293,"--that's what good faith means in trademark law, generally."
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.658,1202.895,Right.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1202.895,1203.772,If I intend to do that.
2004.03-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.521,1231.347,May I ask you--
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1231.347,1232.09,"--if there's confusion, that's a bad--"
2004.03-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.09,1234.569,"--What does the term ""micro color"" describe?"
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1234.569,1236.837,"--The term ""micro color"" describes--"
2004.03-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.027,1253.144,Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the... one party's product in this case?
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1253.144,1259.089,"--I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term ""micro color""."
2004.03-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1300.91,1309.827,"Wasn't there... wasn't there something to the effect that ""micro pigmentation"" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up?"
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1316.514,1317.628,"--That's my understanding, yes."
2004.03-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.628,1321.055,"""Micro pigmentation"" sounds awfully close to ""micro color""."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1321.055,1322.458,"""Micro color"", yeah."
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.003,1332.489,"Well, you have to weigh in on it."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1349.102,1364.046,"--But, Justice Scalia, the problem here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe their product, or not that they failed to act in good faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark, but that it was a--"
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.046,1364.668,"You're right, that's not the issue in the case."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1364.668,1365.123,--Right.
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.352,1377.383,You're right.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1377.383,1383.493,"But, again, our concern is that this statute has to be read with the terms Congress enacted."
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.955,1414.99,"In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances--"
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1414.99,1415.9,Exactly.
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.9,1421.101,--that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1421.101,1421.76,Exactly.
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.76,1424.445,"And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1424.445,1425.392,That's exactly right.
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.138,1449.996,"""Schwartz"", ""Schwartz"" candy bars."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1449.996,1452.104,"--""Schwartz"" candy bar, ""Kodak"", I don't know--"
2004.03-409,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.104,1452.575,It doesn't do anything for you.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1452.913,1455.73,"--I don't know why that is, and why would I want to eat it."
2004.03-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.429,1502.863,How do you tell whether it's used as a mark?
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1513.842,1517.269,--The fair-use defense is unavailable if it's used as a mark.
2004.03-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1517.807,1518.012,Right.
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1518.012,1521.522,"--defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable."
2004.03-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.59,1555.43,"So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like... I mean, as long as they're using just the word ""micro color"", I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark."
2004.03-409,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1560.221,1563.936,"Well, there's... there's going to be difficult questions of proof."
2004.03-409,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.12,1575.946,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1578.564,1588.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.953,1622.553,How can you use a fanciful term descriptively?
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1628.042,1637.785,"--Well, it may mean something in a different context, I think an example you could use would be the arbitrary trademark of ""Apple"" for computers."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.313,1667.712,"No, but do they use the apple as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning, that's what gives it protection."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1681.996,1688.6,"No, Your Honor, the Solicitor General does not take that position either, in their brief they recognize that this applies to all level of mark."
2004.03-409,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1688.6,1693.801,"No, but that, all we need to decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1693.801,1716.109,"Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive, or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately used when this is applied."
2004.03-409,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1716.109,1722.325,"Let's assume that it was descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1727.609,1734.668,"We don't believe that's what the Ninth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment entered against us when we had introduced--"
2004.03-409,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.668,1745.153,"Well, would you agree, then, that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non-trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the fair-use defense without having to show that there's no confusion?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1745.153,1750.605,"--Yes, we believe it's the plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.319,1780.492,"Now, I'm confused. I thought the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1786.027,1786.77,Yes.
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.77,1788.339,"Now, that's the end of this case, isn't it?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1795.769,1803.366,I believe the Petitioner came up with that formulation because they had taken on the burden because they were the movant on summary judgment.
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.172,1808.689,Did you object to the formulation of the question presented?
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1823.512,1835.81,"We agree that the plaintiff, it's clear that under... in the Ninth Circuit... the Ninth Circuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before, made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.81,1856.244,"--Now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1856.244,1857.609,We believe that when Congress--
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.609,1859.299,"You agree with that, or not?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1859.299,1873.211,"--No, Your Honor, we agree that when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms ""used fairly"" to refer to the common law, which included not only the common law of technical trademark, but the common law of unfair competition."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.211,1875.274,"Good, so now we have something I can disagree with you about."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1890.468,1899.673,"Your Honor, the time that those words were used, the common law, and we respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1914.838,1929.023,"All right, so now, if we're going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get protection at all, because I was thinking ""micro color"", well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1945.126,1955.65,"Well, Your Honor, I would urge you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it lists twenty other competitors that sell this very product, they have no cause to use that word."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1963.618,1975.878,"What's the difference between pigment and color, especially when it's not just ""micro color"", don't they advertise ""micro color red"", ""micro color grey"", so pigment--"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1975.878,1987.19,"The typical suggestive term, it was created to associate the high quality that my client markets in this product with that term, I want the ""micro color"" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by--"
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.19,1999.162,"--But, what about the word, is it... am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the word, ""micro pigmentation"" is used in the trade as a synonym for permanent makeup?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1999.162,2006.343,"--That's correct, and oftentimes, trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology."
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.967,2015.342,But there is a sense of color in which color is synonymous with pigment.
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.804,2024.259,Exactly.
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2024.259,2033.342,"Because I thought it was agreed that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive use, is that incorrect?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2033.342,2040.029,"Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the term descriptively."
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.029,2043.623,"Well, could you just point to me... I'm not asking so much about the ""why"", I just want to know what this case is."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2052.371,2069.751,"Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief explains that this purported concession that they discuss about the use of this mark had to do because Justice Ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but assuming they occurred, those were descriptive."
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.007,2083.763,"Excuse me, this still goes to the merits of the defense and not to the question presented."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2115.548,2117.555,"Thank you, Your Honor, I'd be happy to discuss that."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2144.387,2159.331,"Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you there, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you must, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2169.196,2181.085,"--We don't believe it's the defendant's burden, we believe we... the district court was correctly reversed the Ninth Circuit in entering summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.681,2191.282,"I think this is really quite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2213.163,2214.045,We--
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.045,2217.454,"You can surely answer that, ""we agree"", or ""we don't agree""."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2217.454,2218.653,--We don't agree.
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.194,2224.287,"Okay, okay."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2224.287,2227.964,And we would point out that as a textual argument and the purpose argument--
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.964,2239.891,"May I ask, may I just interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2242.574,2254.918,"--As we point out in our brief, Your Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in 1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion--"
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.918,2255.744,So the answer is no.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2255.744,2267.14,"--It remains as a Congressional emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use that is not likely to confuse is allowed."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.521,2270.362,It's allowed without the affirmative defense.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2270.362,2278.823,"--To understand why this came in, it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied only to incontestable marks."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.184,2338.266,"But are you suggesting, I want to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in, back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark did not have to prove likelihood of confusion?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2338.266,2341.943,"--It was presumed by the weight of that, that was the conclusive evidence."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.943,2344.051,"Because otherwise, wouldn't that defeat the defense, too, then?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2344.051,2353.217,"Because the way Congress structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the fourth one."
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.217,2356.068,"No, but you're saying, isn't your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable presumption?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2356.068,2356.234,Yes.
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2356.234,2356.811,Yes.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2356.811,2357.82,"Yes, I'm sorry, yes."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.653,2382.917,"But suppose IBM had used the word ""computers"" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2391.528,2392.809,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.809,2394.007,People would be confused.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2402.468,2407.919,"Your Honor, if that were the case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a generic term with no protection."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.919,2417.866,"Well, at the very beginning, IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it computer, they could have called it a word processor, they could have called it a ""think faster""."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2421.581,2429.3,And Congress took that explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be canceled at any time for genericism.
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.817,2448.331,"So what is this fair-use defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2448.331,2454.813,--Since 1988 it's a vestigial reminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was understood in 1946.
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.41,2465.671,--But we don't usually interpret statutes that way.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2489.038,2490.07,"Two points, Your Honor--"
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.07,2492.586,"Makes it a meaningless statute, really."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2492.586,2493.246,--Two points.
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.819,2508.274,"I thought they did when they outlined to us what it means is you're using it descriptively, and not as a mark."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2508.274,2514.069,"--Your Honor, those are other terms that are used in the statute, those are separate requirements."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.855,2530.088,"Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it as a mark."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2550.166,2562.055,"No, that is one of the factors in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full of examples of that."
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.684,2603.936,"That may well be, but I don't think that's the question presented here."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2612.565,2619.746,"The district court's entry of summary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did that because of its total disregard for likely to confusion--"
2004.03-409,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2619.746,2626.683,"Well, that may be, but the issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too far in the other direction and required too much."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2644.516,2649.922,--I think the ruling from this Court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense against likelihood of confusion.
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2649.922,2663.851,"How about if the ruling were a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2669.607,2671.447,"Yes, and that discussion explains a couple of things."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.644,2691.388,"Well, you would win--"
2004.03-409,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2691.388,2701.79,"You'd still have to vacate the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of it."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2701.79,2719.001,"--Well, Your Honor, we would actually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in support of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case and the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth Circuit reversing the district court should be affirmed, and there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also that are not before the Court that should be affirmed."
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.001,2722.882,"Well, you're urging then that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternate grounds."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2722.882,2723.875,"Yes, Your Honor, that's--"
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.875,2724.823,We rarely do that.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2724.823,2727.795,"--Yes, Your Honor, I understand that, but in this particular situation--"
2004.03-409,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2727.795,2740.055,"Why wouldn't we just vacate it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate the judgment and send it back?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2740.055,2752.481,"--We certainly would agree, Your Honor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand to go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of establishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it held against us."
2004.03-409,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.141,2773.082,They might have been afraid that you'd sue them.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2773.082,2777.744,"That's quite a strong mark, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2777.744,2790.005,"--Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that they were, KP, they were in fact using the word ""micro color"" before you registered your trademark?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2790.005,2793.804,"No, we dispute that, Your Honor, they've never produced one bottle from that period."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.404,2799.127,But that would be... that would be a disputed issue of fact.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2799.127,2799.953,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.953,2809.696,"And are we making any differentiation at all between the mini color red or whatever, and this logo that appears?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2809.696,2811.925,"Yes, all the difference in the world, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.445,2866.417,"Your customers are pretty sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably know this market pretty well."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2866.417,2869.222,"--That's directly relevant to the likelihood of confusion, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.686,2923.919,"Just out of curiosity, it has nothing to do with the case, do they market this product with color charts, just like paint companies do?"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2923.919,2935.686,"They do, Your Honor, that's absolutely right, color wheels, color... and also in the micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely the opposite, it's to hide the color."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.151,2960.123,"I also... it's very efficient to allow people to communicate, in English."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2960.123,2962.231,"--Your Honor, there's nothing to prevent that."
2004.03-409,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.231,2968.918,"Well, I guess that's the question, because sometimes people... I have no doubt--"
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2968.918,2978.882,"Your Honor, I don't think there's anything... the way that Petitioner passed the Lanham Act grossly overstates it."
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.509,3051.145,"What would be a really expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the government here, and it takes the position quite different from yours."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3051.145,3052.714,"--At this point in time, Your Honor."
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.86,3056.884,Why are you saying at this point in time?
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3060.394,3069.971,"--Your Honor, in this case, it... this mark has been put through becoming to... but went through all of the procedures that the PTO required."
2004.03-409,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3072.2,3075.46,They're not assailing the validity of the mark.
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.46,3079.009,"Nobody is challenging it, it's the fair-use defense."
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3079.009,3089.373,"Your Honor, no, what I... the government's position is the same position that, in fact, it urged before Congress in 1946."
2004.03-409,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3132.348,3138.58,Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.
2004.03-409,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3138.58,3148.899,--We believe that the Restatement and the amici are very consistent in rejecting Petitioner's position and the district court's position that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant.
2004.03-409,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.484,3216.683,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
2004.03-409,3,36306,michael_machat,,3219.078,3221.679,Thank you.
2004.03-409,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.874,3334.721,"I forget your position, if you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion that is predictable or that is likely is one of the elements that can be used to determine whether the use is a fair one?"
2004.03-409,3,36306,michael_machat,,3337.305,3341.679,"I would agree, the degree of confusion, but that comes into whether or not--"
2004.03-409,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.679,3342.877,"All right, that's all I wanted to know."
2004.03-409,3,36306,michael_machat,,3342.877,3354.311,"--In this case, ""used fairly"" means, it does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to whether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably accurate description of the mark."
2004.03-409,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3427.545,3430.888,"Thank you, Mr. Machat, the case is submitted."
