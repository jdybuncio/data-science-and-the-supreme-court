1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.507,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-266, Carrie Jaffee v. Marylu Redmond."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,10.739,14.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.273,75.605,"When were the Federal Rules of Evidence adopted, Mr. Flaxman?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,75.605,76.844,"1973, I believe."
1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.844,77.365,Thank you.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,77.365,79.516,And the Court limited spousal privileges.
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,103.052,108.067,"Well, it's not countless if they're licensed and we confine the privilege to those who are licensed."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,111.059,116.963,"Well, except the States are each day creating new counselor status positions."
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.108,126.849,"But are they licensed, or they have some State certification, or is there some document?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,126.849,127.37,Yes.
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.601,130.993,"Well then, I assume they could be counted."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,130.993,136.076,"--They can be counted, but it would be... it would be a very large number."
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.076,140.811,"And Mr. Flaxman, they would be counted in a diversity case, is that not right?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,140.811,141.743,That's absolutely correct.
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,152.884,154.566,Wasn't there one State claim?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,156.599,159.481,There was a supplemental claim brought under State law.
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.432,176.575,Is there precedent that holds that the State--
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,176.575,181.135,"There's precedent among... that principle is recognized, I think uniformly within the circuits."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.969,218.554,"--Well, is it different in kind from the kind of evidence that would be privileged under the clinical... under a privilege for clinical psychologists?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,225.838,226.209,Well--
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.209,228.742,--from what a clinical psychologist learns and hears?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,228.742,233.266,"--Well, we don't know, on this record, what kind of therapy was actually being administered."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.662,241.623,Because?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,241.623,243.125,Because they'd be different kinds of therapy.
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.125,245.208,"Well, what is the difference?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,245.208,258.067,"Well, I think as a rational distinction a legislature could say that a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist are going to be more concerned with psychic reality, and a social worker would be more concerned with helping somebody deal with their... the problems that they're facing."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.168,262.982,"I mean, that sounds very sensible just based on the language we're using."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,267.716,268.186,--It's--
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,268.186,271.329,"It sounds like a reasonable answer, but is it true, I guess is what I'm saying."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,272.588,277.943,"--That's... unlike the number of people who are licensed, that's an answer... that's a question that can't really be ascertained."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.658,281.879,Well--
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,294.113,294.881,That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.772,296.583,"Well, Mr. Flaxman--"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,311.053,312.976,That brief--
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.976,313.644,Or am I incorrect?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,313.644,318.238,"--No, I think you're absolutely correct, but I think they're incorrect in reading the record in this case."
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.117,350.221,"Well, but I infer from their position that formal psychiatric or psychoanalytic sessions are not necessarily different in their objectives than clinical counseling in the more ordinary sense, assuming there's an aura of confidentiality about it, where the confidentiality is expected on both sides."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,350.221,358.468,"--No, I think, and I... perhaps I'm misreading their brief, but I think they make a distinction between psychoanalysis and counseling."
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.127,376.553,"Well, Mr. Flaxman, I take it you would not extend in a Federal case a privilege to a psychiatrist."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,376.553,377.164,That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.438,382.069,Right.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,382.069,384.319,"That when there are confidential interests, and we--"
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.319,386.962,Regardless of what differences there might be--
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,386.962,387.202,--Right.
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.202,390.354,--in the therapy or the nature of the questions.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,390.354,396.388,"That's our primary position, is that the confidential interest... and we concede that there are confidential interests in counseling and therapy."
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.388,402.872,And yet all 50 States recognize some form of privilege in this area.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,402.872,405.533,"Well, some of the... they recognize some form of privilege."
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.282,423.786,"Now, the court below didn't adopt a clear rule of, there is a privilege and that's that."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,430.451,436.217,"--Well, the court below adopted a very unconventional definition of cumulative."
1995.95-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.606,463.314,"In the area of privileged communications, do the Federal courts typically engage in a balancing in determining whether to apply the privilege or not?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,463.314,478.655,"The one circuit that has recog... the Second Circuit has expressly adopted a balancing test, and describes the privilege that it was adopting as nothing more than a requirement that the district judge balance the privacy interest with the opponent's need to know."
1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.655,494.866,"Well, that's really not much of a privilege, is it, because if everything is going to be balanced at the time the evidence is sought to be admitted... the time the privilege is supposed to work is when the person either feels free or does not feel free to confide to the professional therapist."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,494.866,500.23,"Well, we're not seeking disclosures about confidences about feelings or about dreams."
1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.558,511.141,"Well, but that may be a very difficult line to draw."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,519.395,528.522,"Well, it... the district judge and the magistrate judge who supervised the deposition of the respondent didn't have any trouble dealing with that."
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.508,544.544,"Mr. Flaxman, correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought that part of what you were asking did involve mental impressions to the extent that you were asking for the notes of the social worker."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,544.544,554.001,--The notes of the social worker only came up after the respondent testified that she could not recall any of her conversations with the social worker.
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.001,561.785,"Are you now conceding that mental impressions of the social worker, mental impressions reflected in her notes, are things to which you do not have access?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,561.785,570.52,"As a matter of relevancy, that's correct, and the district judge said that we could not get her notes when he was ruling on the relevancy question."
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.096,589.987,"But the conversations, the notes, mix in, as lawyer's notes do, the social worker's own mental impressions with things that the patient or client said about what happened."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,589.987,596.922,"--Well, we were given three pages of heavily redacted notes which made clear the things that the client had said about the incident."
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.526,603.657,But I... please just straighten me out on what your position is.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,607.92,608.532,--Well--
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.532,612.575,"I thought you were saying, we want her notes, without the editing."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,612.575,613.576,--We objected to that.
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.699,666.603,"The propriety of that particular resolution I'm not sure is before us, or that the Court is interested in, but it seems to me very odd."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,683.275,684.517,That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.178,691.152,"And it seems to me that if this is any kind of a privilege, that the same rule should apply here."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,712.446,723.495,"--Well, there's a vast difference between conferring with an attorney who is an officer of the court, who is interested in following the law and not helping somebody change their recollections of an incident, to going into therapy."
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.495,725.425,Mr. Flaxman--
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,733.189,743.487,"An attorney should not be helping somebody change their recollections and commit perjury, and if an attorney does that, then the attorney is subject to sanctions."
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.537,781.193,"Mr. Flaxman, you said earlier that the privilege recognized by some States, which amounts to a balancing of the importance of the information versus the... I guess, what, the confidentiality of it, that that isn't much different from what would be applied anyway in the absence of a privilege."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,781.193,783.687,--In some States there is a judicial override.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.734,793.634,Allow it in.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,793.634,795.545,--Or allow it to be disclosed.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.545,798.908,"Yes, but that still is a privilege of sorts, isn't it?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,798.908,799.479,It's a privilege--
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.479,801.622,"I mean, it's different from the rule which would be applied otherwise."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,801.622,802.631,--That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.344,813.75,"Now, any of these privileges that exist in other States, has any of them been adopted judicially, as a matter of common law?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,815.012,821.957,"The Alaska supreme court adopted in State v. Allred, and the Arizona supreme court."
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.171,829.543,What is the nature of the Alaska and the Arizona privilege adopted--
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,829.543,835.199,"The Alaska privilege applied to psychologists and psychiatrists did not extend to social workers, and the Arizona--"
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.199,835.698,--Absolute?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,835.698,836.199,--That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.199,837.25,It's an absolute privilege.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,837.25,838.181,No.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.623,854.743,And that includes Alaska and Arizona?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,854.743,855.304,--That's correct.
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.403,877.219,"You asked us to recognize a line between statements about fact and statements about feeling, and I confess that I'm skeptical that we could do that."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,889.99,891.622,I think that's on the side that we don't get.
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.942,895.914,"Even though there's an admission in it, that implicit admission in it?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,895.914,896.164,--That's right.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.366,898.357,Why isn't
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,903.072,913.58,"--Because the district judge could say that kind of response is the response that anybody would feel, even if it was justifiable, and the probative value of that statement that I feel bad--"
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,913.58,915.002,"--What if he says, ""I didn't do it""?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,915.002,917.105,"--The statement, I didn't--"
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.105,917.936,"""I didn't kill anybody""."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,920.07,922.634,"--""I didn't kill anybody"" is a statement about the incident."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,923.586,925.596,"No, but that's... no, I'm saying that's his legal position."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,936.74,951.3,"I would... well, I would say that a district judge would require that that denial which... would have to be disclosed, that it wouldn't be privileged, but it would be... that's a... that should not be hidden from the Government in a criminal case, or from a plaintiff in a civil case."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,951.3,953.664,"So you really can't... there's no analytical distinction, then--"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,953.664,954.372,Well--
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.372,956.124,--between the fact and the feeling.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,956.124,961.92,"--That's why we believe this should be a question for the district judge, who can balance all of these factors."
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.821,967.456,"Yes, but even on your balancing theory I thought the judge was supposed to draw... maybe I misunderstood you."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,973.152,973.96,"--No, I--"
1995.95-266,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.96,980.365,--was the appropriateness of admitting the fact as against other interests.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,980.365,987.87,"--I think that's one of the things that the trial judge could be balancing, whether it's fact or feeling, but also the need for the evidence."
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.332,991.846,"I don't understand that, the need for the evidence?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,998.161,1001.243,--With the confidentiality interests that are involved in therapy.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.243,1003.687,"Oh, okay, so you're not denying there ought to be a privilege."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1003.687,1004.425,I--
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.425,1005.957,We're just arguing about what the scope of it ought to be.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1005.957,1008.349,"--No, I am denying there should be... if there's a privilege, then--"
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.349,1010.89,"You see, I thought you were arguing on the basis of relevance before."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1016.455,1016.715,--That's--
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.715,1018.217,There's no balancing there at all.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1020.179,1020.39,--Well--
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.39,1027.521,"But now you say there is a balancing, so you're willing to acknowledge that some stuff doesn't get in because it's subject to--"

1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.834,1059.287,--That really isn't much of a privilege at all.

1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.186,1072.037,Why?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1072.648,1076.101,--Because there are confidential interests involved in therapy.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.101,1076.401,Privilege.

1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1152.341,1152.571,Well--

1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1178.352,1178.623,--Well--
1995.95-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.623,1182.726,--in logic or policy that would make that distinction?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1182.726,1189.842,"--There is no reason for a physician-patient privilege, and that privilege is not recognized in the Federal courts."
1995.95-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.842,1208.384,"No, look, I'm asking why... if a person goes to a doctor and the person has cancer, or the person has a skin disease, or the person has an itch, there is a privilege for statements made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1238.284,1253.184,"Well, the distinction... there are many distinctions that can be made, but the fundamental difference that... the fundamental reason why there's no need to make that distinction is because there is no privilege for when you go to a doctor and say I've a broken foot."
1995.95-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.184,1254.346,I'll try once more.
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1259.308,1259.689,Well--
1995.95-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.689,1264.912,"And what I'm asking is... it's only me who's interested, perhaps, but I am interested."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1282.913,1285.056,--There's no reason for drawing the line.
1995.95-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.542,1296.102,Am I not being clear?

1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1374.8,1388.549,"--Oh, it would be, especially in a case like this, where we've had the disclosures made in November of 1991, which is 5 or 6 months after the incident, that respondent Redmond was unable to recall pulling the trigger."
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.368,1404.012,"How many States have a physician's privilege, by the way?"
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1404.012,1405.551,Virtually all States.
1995.95-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.551,1407.663,"Virtually all of them, and yet we don't in Federal courts."
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1407.663,1408.194,That's correct.

1995.95-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1420.375,1421.356,And how about the circuits?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1421.356,1425.577,--The circuits have uniformly rejected a physician privilege.
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1449.596,1455.232,Suppose the clergyperson is also a licensed social worker?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1455.232,1461.396,The question then is whether the sessions were clerical in nature or counseling in nature.
1995.95-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.757,1465.567,Suppose the answer is both?
1995.95-266,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1465.567,1468.91,--That would be a difficult question for the district judge to balance.
1995.95-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.723,1506.794,"Very well, Mr. Flaxman."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1508.016,1514.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.422,1584.588,"Mr. Rogus, did the court also balance the need for the evidence with its notion of the privilege?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1584.588,1586.921,--The court did engage in balancing.
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.921,1594.996,Is that the way that Federal courts normally approach the exercise of a privilege?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1594.996,1602.052,"That is a technique and approach that is used, was mentioned by the Second Circuit in the Doe case."
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1604.693,1608.977,Do you defend that as an appropriate approach?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1608.977,1617.564,--The need for balancing is appropriate particularly with respect to determining when an exception to a privilege should come into play.
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.564,1622.416,"Well, would that be the approach in the case of an attorney-client privilege, for example?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1623.497,1630.913,"Well, I think that has been done in the sense of the recognition of the privilege, for example, in the crime fraud exception."
1995.95-266,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.991,1640.313,But that's not balancing.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1663.28,1665.643,"--Well, the privilege, the underlying privilege should be granted."
1995.95-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.752,1678.912,Is that a case-by-case balancing?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1678.912,1682.194,"--No, not a case-by-case balancing."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.031,1690.932,"Well, is it possible--"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1705.303,1714.719,"If it were the only evidence available on a material element of the cause of action, that would certainly affect the balancing."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.719,1716.802,"--Well, I'd consider that case-by-case, myself."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1742.659,1752.116,"Well, in this instance, psychotherapists do need to tell their patients... patients do need to know that their communications are confidential."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.116,1760.01,So you're in effect starting with a presumption of confidentiality subject to case-by-case balancing on the issue of exception?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1760.01,1764.153,"A presumption of confidentiality, yes."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.153,1764.394,Okay.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1764.394,1764.975,In this--
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.975,1769.349,"That's a much weaker sense of privilege, then, than the sort of classic privileges."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1769.349,1776.343,--We did not and we are not asking for recognition of an absolute privilege.
1995.95-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.343,1777.104,Okay.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1787.103,1787.343,If--
1995.95-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.343,1791.897,"Where I'm confused, and don't really understand it too well, is the status of the doctor and client."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1803.07,1836.553,"--I'm saying if anything the psychotherapy... the psychotherapist-patient privilege should be recognized more readily than the doctor-patient because of, once again, the nature of the privacy interests involved, the types of things that people go to see psychotherapists for, the types of things that people discuss with psychotherapists that touch upon very... not always, but very frequently very highly private personal concerns, so if anything there's more reason to recognize the psychotherapist--"
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.553,1842.817,And you think that the doctor doesn't receive communications of a very private nature from a patient?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1842.817,1844.82,--I am not saying that a doctor does not.
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.82,1851.293,Do you concede that there is no doctor-patient privilege recognized in the Federal courts?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1851.293,1854.715,"I believe that it has not been recognized, but that is not--"
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.715,1857.608,"And that that is the general rule in the courts, in the circuits?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1857.608,1859.551,--I believe that is correct.
1995.95-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.551,1861.144,So what are we supposed to do about that?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1869.391,1872.383,Psychotherapists should have the privilege.
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1890.827,1905.517,"You keep speaking of the function, and if you speak in terms of the function, then there's never any question as to whether, if a privilege for psychotherapy is recognized, it would cover social workers, as in this case."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1930.492,1951.086,"My understanding, based upon what was developed in the record, and the research, and the information provided by the amici, is that the training, the education, and the functioning of clinical social workers approaches if not equates to what clinical psychologists do in terms of performing the psychotherapeutic function, of doing psychotherapy."
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1951.086,1952.408,But they don't have the advanced degree.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1957.221,1962.306,"Well, there is... I wouldn't say that one degree is more advanced than another."
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1990.055,1990.546,But I suppose--
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,1999.823,2009.601,"--It is our understanding that of the 50 States that recognize privileges, 44 of them do, in fact, extend that privilege to clinical social workers."
1995.95-266,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2009.601,2016.015,And do those persons who hold that privilege have a duty of confidentiality under their own professional ethical standards?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2016.015,2016.155,"Yes, they do."
1995.95-266,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2018.308,2028.964,"But you're saying that the courts should not recognize what is generally understood as a duty of confidentiality, even in the patient-client, patient-doctor relation, much less this."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2028.964,2032.317,"--If that is what my previous remarks sounded like, that is not what I meant to say."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.75,2038.25,I suppose I have a duty of confidentiality.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2053.94,2062.089,"But you are not engaging, under the facts as you've laid them out, in a psychotherapeutic."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.089,2066.994,"No, I understand that, but I just don't see the relevance of the fact that there is a duty of confidentiality."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2079.702,2089.036,This arises in the setting of a professional approach to psychotherapy and the importance and value that society puts in--
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2089.036,2089.277,"Yes, but--"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2089.277,2095.321,"--having and maintaining such a profession for the purpose of aiding members of society, and in this particular--"
1995.95-266,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.321,2096.062,--That allows us--
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2104.417,2113.235,"--It certainly is, an expectation of confidentiality, and there is an expectation of confidentiality and the protection of private communications when a patient engages in a psychotherapeutic--"
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2113.235,2123.64,"Okay, so we can draw the line simply by saying the line's got to be drawn somewhere, and we're going to draw it at the point at which the person receiving the communication is licensed by the State."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2153.55,2157.543,"--Once again, we are talking about a particular function here."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.543,2180.29,"Well, the function is feeling better, and I don't denigrate that, by telling somebody something, and so the function is being performed... talk about poor man's psychiatrist, but the function is being performed when they tell me, but... and so it seems to me there's no reason in principle why I shouldn't be able to claim the privilege."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2184.461,2195.368,"And the difference would be once again, not only what... how the person feels when they have talked to you, brought to you whatever their... what's on their mind, what they're feeling, et cetera, but what you, in turn, can tell them and help them."
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.368,2204.814,"What can the psychiatrist tell... even the full-dress psychiatrist, if we grant the sort of privilege that you want us to grant?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2206.056,2206.347,"Well, my--"
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.347,2211.95,"What you tell me will, what, probably, most likely, be held in confidence?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2211.95,2215.734,--What you will tell me will be held in confidence.
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.734,2216.084,He can't say that.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2218.705,2224.509,There are some exceptions that have been noted by the courts based on--
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.509,2226.71,Is there any State that has no exceptions?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2226.71,2228.342,--No.
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.785,2232.337,And some have very broad exceptions.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2234.12,2236.119,That would be correct.
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.119,2244.344,"Well, what could a psychistrist possibly comfort his patient with, what kind of assurance could he possibly comfort his patient with in that kind of a State?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2244.344,2245.486,Because the exception should be--
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.486,2245.806,Very little.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2245.806,2254.652,"--very narrowly and... there should be very few exceptions, and they should be very narrowly drawn to fit only certain categorical situations."
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2254.772,2255.182,If--
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2255.182,2285.062,"--For example, I think one of the instances that was referred to during Mr. Flaxman's argument was if something should be mentioned in terms of a definite threat of harm to a specifically identified individual, if a person goes in, talks to their therapist and says, I'm going to kill Joe Smith, and there is no reason for the clinician to doubt that that person is in fact capable of and will, and would carry out that specific threat to Joe Smith."
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2299.562,2317.222,"--But I take it even on your scheme if Smith is dead, and an admission has been made to a psychiatric social worker and to no one else, and a case cannot be proven without that beyond a reasonable doubt, without that admission, you would let the admission in, wouldn't you?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2317.222,2324.548,Under the... if it were the only evidence--
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.548,2325.549,Right.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2326.79,2327.261,--Then I--
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.261,2327.932,You'd let it in.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2327.932,2331.675,--There have been cases that allow that testimony in under--
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2331.675,2347.207,"So whatever the value of being able to assure the patient of confidentiality may be, on your theory that value would be absent, because the social worker, the psychiatrist, the psychologist could not say, what you tell me is in confidence."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2352.648,2356.82,"--Yes, in a sense."
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2356.82,2357.281,All right.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2357.281,2357.671,Based on--
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2357.671,2365.018,"Now, what about a case like this, in which there is a claim that memory enhancement may be involved?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2392.509,2394.15,--Several points in response to that.
1995.95-266,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2401.497,2403.979,But there are grounds for some suspicion.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2412.024,2416.148,"--Whether the law of the State of Illinois... no, I believe it would have been privileged."
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2416.148,2422.322,"And you don't rely, apparently, in giving your responses, on what State law allows or doesn't allow?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2428.426,2446.409,"As the Court indicated in Trammel, we certainly, in terms of formulating the Federal rule, can look to State law for guidance, but inasmuch as there was a Federal question involved in this case, and under the language of 501, we can look to State law for guidance, but State law as State law would not control the question."
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.409,2446.459,All right.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2464.236,2475.204,At the common law prior to the early seventies there was no vast body of case law indicating one way or the other whether there was a psychotherapist patient-privilege or not.
1995.95-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.478,2512.45,What do we look to for the... determining what the principles of the common law are here?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2512.45,2523.626,"The principles of the common law would... basically we would look to the development of the law through cases and court decisions, that is correct, and as of the time 501 was enacted, once again, no, there was not a--"
1995.95-266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.626,2531.013,"Mr. Rogus, do you know if there are any States that recognize a psychotherapist privilege and do not recognize a doctor-patient privilege?"
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2531.013,2534.305,--Off-hand I do not know the answer to that question.
1995.95-266,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.305,2542.721,"Mr. Rogus, Mr. Flaxman said there were two States that had this privilege by virtue of court decisions."
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2561.794,2565.136,I do not know specifically how many.
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.953,2573.015,Why shouldn't we do the same?
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2584.873,2585.614,And in that--
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.614,2587.427,I wouldn't know which common law rule to adopt.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2601.457,2606.943,"But the basic thrust of what has been going on in the States is to recognize the privilege and, given once again that--"
1995.95-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.943,2608.114,It doesn't get you anywhere.
1995.95-266,1,26005,gregory_e_rogus,,2629.784,2632.187,--Thank you.
1995.95-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.187,2634.809,"Thank you, Mr. Rogus."
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2636.358,2649.738,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2674.254,2675.265,"Well, they recognize something."
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2689.145,2689.796,--I--
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2689.796,2690.635,Why bother?
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2690.635,2695.479,"--Well, I... actually, we... it's not our position that that's what the Court ought to do."
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.479,2696.81,"Well, what's your position--"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2696.81,2697.07,Our--
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2697.07,2701.484,--on the value of a... of the kind of presumption that he was arguing for?

1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2716.376,2718.439,"If that's all we did, should we do it at all?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2718.439,2719.03,--Yes.
1995.95-266,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2762.415,2773.68,"Mr. Feldman, how could you justify a psychologist-social worker privilege without recognizing a medical doctor privilege?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2773.68,2781.107,"There has been... in our view the case for medical doctor privilege has not yet been compellingly enough made, and I'll tell you why."
1995.95-266,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.147,2819.06,"Well, that's just exactly... what can I read to find out about this?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2866.853,2881.893,"In the advisory committee notes on Rule... proposed Rule 504, they do specifically go into that question, and they cite a previous paper that was issued by the Group for the Advancement of Psychology... I don't recall the exact name... that explored the subject more fully."
1995.95-266,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.263,2933.757,"Mr. Feldman, why... let's assume that the consultation occurs in a State that has the very negligible... under State law, the very negligible privilege that you said it's worth adopting, but it won't do a whole lot of good, so all that that person can tell the client is, you know, under State law, you have very little assurance of confidentiality."
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2960.678,2966.15,It would certainly be a possible rule to set the Federal ceiling at the State floor.
1995.95-266,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.15,2968.412,"Well, wonderful, but can we do that under the Federal rule?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2975.027,2976.389,I think that... I've two answers.
1995.95-266,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2996.163,2997.585,"Well, it's not just that State's policy."
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3004.32,3004.61,--But--
1995.95-266,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3004.61,3007.682,--and I have the same trouble as Justice Scalia does.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3009.145,3032.83,"--I wanted to get to the second point, which was that in our brief we suggest that the key question is whether a confidential relationship is formed, and that question, since States are the primary level of government that governs the relationships of psychotherapists and patients, as with most other professions, the question of whether a confidential relationship, a highly confidential, an extraordinarily confidential relationship is formed, I think it's reasonable to look to State law for that."
1995.95-266,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3032.83,3036.793,"So you look to licensing, plus the extent of privilege, State by State?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3036.793,3041.238,I think you'd look to the question of whether the privilege extends to this kind of a relationship.
1995.95-266,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.4,3048.524,Under the rubric of whether or not there's a reasonable justification to believe that the communication is confidential?
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3048.524,3056.929,"--Under the rubric of, if there's... the Federal privilege... a necessity for the application of any privilege is that a confidential relationship is formed."
1995.95-266,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.59,3088.681,"Mr. Feldman, in this case would Illinois have recognized a privilege for what's at issue here?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3088.681,3089.152,--Yes.
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.586,3094.605,I was unclear on your answer a moment ago.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3098.098,3098.449,Yes.
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.449,3102.402,Or are you arguing... so you're not arguing for a rule that would vary from State to State.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3102.402,3103.774,It would... no more--
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3103.774,3104.085,Okay.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3166.197,3167.647,--I think not quite.
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3201.32,3211.846,"Yes, but on your understanding, if there were 45 States that recognized a social worker's privilege and 5 that didn't, you would say we ought to recognize it, right?"
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3211.846,3212.707,I think--
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.707,3213.989,As a uniform Federal rule.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3213.989,3214.249,--No.
1995.95-266,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3214.898,3215.179,No.
1995.95-266,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3215.179,3231.561,"--The Federal rule should be that where the State recognizes a confidential relationship, recognizes a privilege with respect to a given category of provider, that in those cases I think there's enough uniformity in the States to say that a Federal privilege is also warranted."
1995.95-266,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.561,3232.783,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3235.054,3235.785,Thank you.
1995.95-266,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.399,3282.152,Could I ask a question about State law?
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3308.341,3309.951,That's what I believe the Court should do.
1995.95-266,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.862,3314.555,"No, I'm not saying what it should do, but isn't that the way things work?"
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3323.032,3334.09,"--That's correct, but Illinois can't even make that assurance, because the common law trend of courts has not been to create privileges, it's been to create exceptions to broad statutory privileges."
1995.95-266,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.806,3346.3,Do you agree that this communication would be privileged in the Illinois courts?
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3346.991,3351.023,"I agree that we don't know, and we wouldn't know unless we litigated it in the Illinois courts."
1995.95-266,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.567,3380.474,"And is it true that the rule they apply is governed... in the State law cases is governed by the law in the State where the conversation occurred, rather than where the case is being tried?"
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3380.474,3384.217,"--I think it's the conversation where the case is being tried, rather than where it occurred."
1995.95-266,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3387.95,3394.005,"Why has it never arisen, where someone in... you've practiced a lot in 1983 cases."
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3407.925,3412.206,--We don't face that problem because the district judges uniformly say there's no privilege.
1995.95-266,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3413.197,3419.903,But wouldn't you think some doctor somewhere or a hospital somewhere would have faced a subpoena for some confidential patient records and would have asked us?
1995.95-266,3,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3419.903,3424.335,"--That hasn't happened, and I don't think it... it's just routinely accepted."
1995.95-266,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.335,3425.436,"Thank you, Mr. Flaxman."
