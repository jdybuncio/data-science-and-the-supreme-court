2011.10-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.035,We'll hear argument--
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,8.939,11.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.401,62.472,"Counsel, we asked for two questions presented."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,84.987,97.645,I'm proposing a clear line that would divide situations in which the court of appeals would have power and those in which it absolutely has no power.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.645,102.615,Is that a question of power or a question of exercise of discretion?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,102.615,109.685,"I would say it's a question of power, and this is why."
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.685,113.172,That seems sort of strange.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,127.766,142.608,"Well, what I'm proposing is that there are situations when it is never a proper exercise of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the habeas context."
2011.10-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.608,146.243,"Well, that's what we said in Day, isn't it?"
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,146.243,159.468,"Correct, that in Day the Court said that courts -- ""courts""; it wasn't directed at appellate courts, but -- no court would be free to disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of limitations defense."
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.468,162.07,So all this fight is about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,162.07,163.189,"Well, that's--"
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,163.189,164.705,As opposed to power?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,164.705,178.429,"--That's our primary, our primary argument, is that there was a deliberate waiver in this case and, given, what this Court said in Day, the case could be resolved on that narrow ground."
2011.10-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.429,200.858,"It is what the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this is a deliberate waiver and the government says no, it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to take it up."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,213.633,234.163,"That's correct and my position also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and that when the statute of limitations defense is forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a timely manner -- because of a deliberate choice, I mean -- and in this instance--"
2011.10-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.163,239.967,"Well, are there a lot of cases raising, you know, the ambiguity that exists in this case?"
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,292.018,297.339,--Well I clearly want a decision that would favor my client.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,315.633,332.679,"Only the opportunity or when it acknowledges -- in Day we faulted the district court for not telling the State essentially, which -- not telling the State that it had a potential statute of limitations defense."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,354.342,358.846,"--Well, both -- the district court ordered the State to announce--"
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.846,359.579,You're not answering my question.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,359.579,360.379,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.379,369.902,Does the court of appeals have the power sua sponte to raise it if the state -- neither the court or the State addressed the issue?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,369.902,371.387,Probably yes.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.387,372.82,All right.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,376.458,377.541,That's correct.
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,401.906,420.135,"It sounds like what you're arguing is that the court of appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead of a deliberate waiver."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,421.653,425.705,Or a purposeful forfeiture.
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,427.391,430.259,They put it in the wrong -- they abused their discretion by putting it in the wrong box.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,434.794,442.416,"--Well, the way the court of appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved by this Court, because--"
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,442.416,448.054,This is what -- this is what troubles me about your argument that the court of appeals abused its discretion.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,459.362,469.151,"--What happened, Your Honor, is that we were appointed at the certificate of appealability stage and we were ordering to brief timeliness."
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,497.653,506.343,But you're arguing that the court of appeals abused its discretion by failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you didn't make?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,506.343,507.909,--No.
2011.10-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.02,563.612,"Well, you had two opportunities at least to make the argument based on the original post-conviction motion, the 1995 post-conviction motion."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,570.466,579.539,Silent on the impact of the 19 -- we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.
2011.10-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.058,624.836,"Well then, I'm confused because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that the question was asked did you file another post-conviction motion; answer: No."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,624.836,627.805,I understand your question now.
2011.10-9995,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,701.97,704.455,"Ms. Lord, could I ask you about the first question presented?"
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,704.455,704.955,--Uh-hmm.
2011.10-9995,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,704.955,709.574,"As I understand the opposing argument, it goes sort of like this."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,759.422,760.791,Both.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,836.357,837.459,I'm a little confused.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,870.63,873.565,--It raises different concerns.
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,902.148,904.684,But those arguments were rejected in Granberry and Day.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,904.684,905.369,"--Well, that--"
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,905.369,906.252,Why should they win now?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,906.252,926.782,"--Well, and that was -- I was going to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, which is there is something really different going on in Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the State."
2011.10-9995,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,981.065,986.135,But didn't Day say that those two issues were functionally identical for this purpose?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,986.135,988.321,Not for this purpose.
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1038.004,1040.387,What Rule of Civil Procedure applies here?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1045.49,1051.811,--I'm referring to Civil Rule of Procedure 8(b) and 12.
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1051.811,1055.298,"Well, they refer to what happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1059.667,1067.023,"Well, there is the traditional rule that if you don't raise it you lose it, when we are talking about a statute of limitations defense."
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1095.44,1102.446,"You made an argument in your brief that I found it a little difficult to follow, so maybe you can explain it."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1132.631,1152.712,"Well, if the State had challenged timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it would, it would have created a real complicated issue on abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how complicated that is under Colorado law."
2011.10-9995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.01,1227.993,So what's wrong with that?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1237.883,1240.151,--Absolutely we should not.
2011.10-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1275.624,1276.074,"No, no."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1276.86,1287.882,"No -- because he was assured that he could go forward on two substantial constitutional claims without worrying about time bar, because the State said that."
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1292.369,1293.985,That's what I don't understand.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1316.318,1325.274,"Well, the connection is, the State guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness."
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1338.114,1340.1,I understand why that's a benefit to him.
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1344.385,1345.17,--Oh.
2011.10-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.107,1509.11,"Ms. Lord, an amicus brief filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil -- Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be consulted here, because they govern only to the extent that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply, and that they -- that they cut against your case."
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1513.864,1516.799,It may be.
2011.10-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1544.333,1554.424,Isn't the screening function that the -- the district court performs in the habeas case inconsistent with the traditional rule about raising affirmative defenses?
2011.10-9995,0,33893,kathleen_lord,,1554.424,1559.726,"--Well, that's the district court, and that's one of the key differences between the district court and the appellate court."
2011.10-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.378,1640.213,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1647.267,1650.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1688.111,1688.678,Where?
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1694.832,1696.866,On the -- on the second question?
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.77,1702.67,Please give me a citation.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1702.67,1706.055,"--College Savings Bank is one, probably the clearest case."
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.055,1706.755,And it has to be what?
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1708.574,1712.143,Unequivocal is a common -- for waiver of every--
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.143,1713.059,You just told me the statute.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1803.386,1812.075,"--Justice Breyer, what the State was doing here was not strategically trying to--"
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.075,1816.895,"Oh, no, I assume they didn't do anything mean, unstrategic."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1838.976,1846.046,"--Justice Breyer, the -- the Court has been clear that a State's failure -- normally, that's true."
2011.10-9995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.938,1864.976,But this wasn't failure to raise an argument; this was representing to the court: We will not challenge timeliness.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1880.053,1885.873,"Justice Ginsburg, there was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you say."
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.825,1889.475,Didn't the State adhere to that?
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1889.475,1892.111,"--That's right, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.111,1892.927,"It kept its word, didn't it?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1892.927,1898.598,"What the State was trying to do, I think, is slightly different than would make sense in any other context."
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.559,1915.992,"Wait, wait, wait."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1948.53,1949.732,--That is--
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1949.732,1950.882,You said you didn't care.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1950.882,1955.969,--I don't think that's quite an accurate characterization of what the State--
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.969,1956.319,All right.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1964.492,1969.527,"--Well, the Black's Law Dictionary, of course, applies the usual rule."
2011.10-9995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1987.155,1996.094,"But, Mr. Domenico, you're saying something considerably more."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2015.425,2023.863,"It's unequivocal that we were not going to press it again, though I think the implication -- there would have been no reason to have raised it initially."
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2034.819,2047.063,"Can I, can I ask you, do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment of a known right?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2059.787,2061.822,"Well, in that case--"
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2061.822,2064.857,"Is that what you're saying, intent, deliberate?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2064.857,2067.424,--Well you have to know what it is you are giving up.
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2067.424,2070.242,"Well, you knew you had a defense under the statute of limitations."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2070.242,2071.511,Sure.
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2071.511,2076.998,"You thought, because you conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was untimely."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2103.732,2114.021,"The -- what we were abandoning to the extent we were abandoning -- abandoning anything, it was our ability to force the court to address the issue."
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2121.527,2123.896,You were protecting the court's right to do whatever it wanted.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2123.896,2126.146,--There was a screening -- there was a screening function.
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2132.317,2145.992,"So why isn't it an abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to sua sponte raise that defense?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2145.992,2151.73,"--Well, we did not take off the table the court's right to consider the issue."
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.73,2153.415,You say you didn't abandon the right.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2155.765,2156.7,We did not abandon.
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.7,2161.486,Just gave up the opportunity to raise it yourself.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2161.486,2167.323,I think it's confusion between what we are calling a right or the issue or the defense.
2011.10-9995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2174.329,2179.381,"Well, let me give you this example of a regular civil case."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2199.461,2208.067,"Well, I think in your typical case it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally are deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case."
2011.10-9995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2215.987,2218.523,Under the terminology we are using wouldn't that be a forfeiture?
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2218.523,2221.375,I think it's better understood as a forfeiture.
2011.10-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.378,2232.432,"--That's why your colleague on the other side, why she made this point the way she made it."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2274.225,2292.054,"--Well, if the Court looks at the -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the Granberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day and the concern there is that with the court overriding a state's decision to waive, to take the issue off the table."
2011.10-9995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2300.743,2317.954,"But the consequence of that was the district court then had to deal with the case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted claims and rule on them, after having told the district court you don't need -- we are not raising the statute of limitations."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2411.298,2413.416,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2425.974,2427.926,"Those are sunk costs, aren't they, Mr. Domenico?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2427.926,2428.61,"They are, Justice--"
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.61,2440.233,"It's water over the dam and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then have to repeat the district court's excursus into the merits, right?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2440.233,2441.435,--That's exactly right.
2011.10-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.538,2476.775,That's a matter of discretion with the court of appeals.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2476.775,2477.875,Absolutely.
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.885,2497.356,"And the court of appeals could have gotten mad at the fact that district court was compelled to go through the merits, right?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2497.356,2498.539,Absolutely.
2011.10-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.539,2499.956,And for that reason could have denied it.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2501.808,2516.333,"Well, it didn't get mad partly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued that the issue was forfeited or waived at all until after, after the court of appeals had already resolved the question."
2011.10-9995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2516.333,2520.769,"Well, why do you say that the position that the State took in the district court permitted the district court from considering the time limits issue?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2528.291,2529.425,Absolutely.
2011.10-9995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2582.962,2600.237,"Mr. Domenico, do I understand your argument correctly to think that if you had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not we are not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the State had said is, we are not challenging this, Your Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under Day?"
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2600.237,2601.673,I think that's a harder case.
2011.10-9995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2626.539,2627.741,If this is--
2011.10-9995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2627.741,2628.191,I'm sorry.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2659.795,2661.728,I don't think you need to say that.
2011.10-9995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.552,2734.426,"There is something about the principle of party presentation, the party raises the issue, the court of appeals is the court of review, not first view."
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2800.218,2807.741,"Justice Ginsburg, again, I don't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the district court not to address the issue."
2011.10-9995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2814.545,2817.914,You didn't say: We were going to refrain from it.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2823.818,2827.12,"Well, I disa -- I do think we qualified it."
2011.10-9995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2840.529,2843.397,--But isn't the concession language really going to a different point?
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2849.735,2853.753,"--I don't think it is, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.753,2854.387,Please.
2011.10-9995,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2854.387,2867.347,"I don't think that there is any reason for us to have been concerned about how, if we had simply stated we are not challenging it, there would have been no concern about this affecting any other case whatsoever."
2011.10-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.584,2874.734,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-9995,2,33893,kathleen_lord,,2879.654,2880.387,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2011.10-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.387,2891.212,Ms. Sherry.
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2891.212,2894.264,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-9995,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2907.988,2913.059,"Ms. Sherry, there is one difference, is you put Granberry and Day together, ti gets you most of the way there."
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2943.178,2945.113,A couple of responses to that.
2011.10-9995,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2951.017,2952.317,But at the time trial level--
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2952.317,2952.767,--At the trial level--
2011.10-9995,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2952.767,2956.838,"--Of course, the habeas court has a significant screening function."
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2956.838,2958.02,"--No, that's certainly true."
2011.10-9995,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3009.287,3025.315,"Well, I may have forgotten the procedural complications of this case, but here, did the State have any opportunity before the court of appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time when the court of appeals issued its certificate of appealability?"
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3031.653,3043.876,"The State did have an opportunity in the court of appeals because after the application for a certificate of appealability was filed, the court did order the State to file a response, and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response."
2011.10-9995,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.951,3112.521,But the difference is that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of limitations defense.
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3149.463,3159.236,"--I -- I think that certainly is true, but I think it's important in deciding whether or not this should be treated as a deliberate waiver to look at what the consequences of treating it as such would be."
2011.10-9995,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.332,3183.451,So why is that -- why is that a bad result?
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3216.857,3217.324,--Well--
2011.10-9995,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3217.324,3231.367,"Now in two and three, you can say this; you could say the reason that we depart from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it in your defense is we are trying to protect the State -- because of habeas."
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3250.345,3255.399,--Because it's not just about the State.
2011.10-9995,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3267.123,3268.107,Despite forfeiture.
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3268.107,3269.259,"Despite forfeiture, right."
2011.10-9995,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.259,3269.592,And--
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3269.592,3275.646,"And -- and that's the very question here, whether it should be treated like forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver."
2011.10-9995,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3316.021,3321.525,But we have a system where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3342.171,3352.396,"And -- and to be clear, I think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and do consider in deciding whether to exercise their discretion to consider a timeliness issue."
2011.10-9995,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3358.133,3364.953,"The Court did say that if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, then no court can bring it up."
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3366.437,3368.822,That's -- that's what the Court said in Day.
2011.10-9995,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.534,3423.406,"So you're saying that if the Court says, you know, you have a good state of limitations defense, you would clearly win on that."
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3427.758,3430.144,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2011.10-9995,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.144,3442.534,"Would it be an abuse of discretion for the Court not to accept a valid, evident statute of limitations defense on the ground that the State didn't raise it?"
2011.10-9995,3,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3442.534,3452.075,"I think under -- under Day, the question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I think under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances."
2011.10-9995,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.354,3497.721,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3499.473,3508.912,The problems with the rulings urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold.
2011.10-9995,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3522.053,3531.075,"If a State knows that it has a potential statute of limitations defense and says nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?"
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3531.075,3539.681,"It would be a violation of Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they are required to file a response."
2011.10-9995,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3544.002,3546.787,"So simply saying nothing can be a waiver, in your view."
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3546.787,3556.393,Probably not.
2011.10-9995,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3558.845,3570.319,"If the answer to that is not, then what is the difference between saying nothing, knowing that you have a defense and saying we're not challenging but we're not conceding?"
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3571.286,3577.14,"--Well, by not conceding, that doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver."
2011.10-9995,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3591.65,3593.283,Let me just ask it one more way and then I'll--
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3593.283,3594.185,I'm sorry.
2011.10-9995,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3594.185,3599.772,"--Back in the office, they're considering -- in the State's office, they're considering what they're going to do."
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3605.575,3612.579,"In the face of Rule 5's requirements, it could very well be a waiver."
2011.10-9995,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.685,3674.82,"Finish your sentence, please."
2011.10-9995,4,33893,kathleen_lord,,3674.82,3683.509,--the State is suggesting will just take away all the efficiencies that -- that that 1 year brought to bear.
2011.10-9995,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3683.509,3684.292,"Thank you, counsel."
