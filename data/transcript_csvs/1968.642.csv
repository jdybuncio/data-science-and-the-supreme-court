1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,25.205,29.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,145.962,146.268,Mr. Gibbons --
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,146.268,146.537,Now --
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,146.537,152.591,-- may I ask you whether that last point was raised and decided below?
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,158.363,158.563,"Yes, it was --"
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,158.563,159.982,If it is --
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,159.982,160.454,-- raised below.
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,160.454,163.065,Would you show me where?
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,168.054,176.85,"Well, it was raised in my brief, I do not know whether the Supreme Court of Alabama considered it or not."
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,181.979,183.921,"There's nothing in there, the decision on it."
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,185.819,186.058,No.
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,186.764,188.477,-- we have before us.
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,188.477,192.29,There is no treatment in the Supreme Court of Alabama decision as to that point.
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,192.29,193.643,Alright.
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,193.643,194.023,Now --
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,194.023,196.847,I want to be very clear on this Mr. Gibbons because it's a --
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,196.847,196.997,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,196.997,199.734,-- jurisdictional matter.
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,199.734,200.186,Well --
1968.642,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,200.186,216.89,There is nothing in the papers before us that shows that the point with respect to them -- your argument with respect to the need for standards to guide the jury in imposing a punishment.
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,226.924,234.508,I would -- the only thing I can say is that it was raised in the court below.
1968.642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.906,245.791,"Well, if your brief here printed in the Supreme Court of Alabama --"
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,245.791,246.386,I don't know.
1968.642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.386,247.951,I'm not sure you say it's correct.
1968.642,0,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,247.951,251.978,I don't know about whether it is or not.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1782.898,1786.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1878.719,1879.863,What was his name?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1879.863,1884.292,"Evan Austill, A-U-S-T-I double L judge."
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.226,1904.603,I gather that you don't raise the question of the -- these questions being properly presented or do you?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1904.603,1904.924,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1905.016,1905.949,You don't mention it on your brief?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1905.949,1912.757,"I'm not the going to but I would stand on my brief, I think it explains some of it Your Honor."
1968.642,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.757,1915.599,Do you raise -- do you speak of -- about that in your brief?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1920.879,1924.486,Which particular question was that Your Honor?
1968.642,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.486,1931.851,Whether we can reach questions which were not raised and decided under your State Supreme Court?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1931.851,1949.944,"Well, I feel that under this Section, Title 15, Section 382, 1-13 wherein the Supreme Court considered all the things raised at the trial that you could do that sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.944,1964.196,"As far as it appears from what I've been able to a glean, of course we don't have the briefs of the parties before the Supreme Court before us but really nothing at all was raised at the trial."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1996.114,1996.297,That's right.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.297,2005.388,And neither one of the other two questions so far as I can find out was raised or considered or decided in any of the courts of Alabama.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2007.376,2007.699,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.73,2016.117,It wasn't raised at the trial?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2016.117,2016.655,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2016.655,2017.675,Either one of these two odd questions.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2017.675,2018.073,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2024.512,2025.404,Yes.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2025.404,2027.419,Whether Witherspoon applies to this.
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2052.868,2061.188,"Well, Mr. Clark is there anything in the record to show that any one of those jurors have asked any question at all about anything at any time?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2061.188,2062.603,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2071.085,2071.26,Well --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2071.26,2073.791,It was an agreed jury.
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.804,2080.498,"We are even not very qualified, don't we?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2085.293,2086.529,They want a jury.
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.529,2091.362,We don't even know what they can hear?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2098.414,2098.635,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2101.553,2104.381,But where is the qualification in this record.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2104.381,2106.608,"By agreement, both sides agreed that they --"
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.608,2118.246,"Now the record says it -- well, the judge says, If I'm correct, there are 12 people there."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2133.529,2139.627,That Mr. Flagger was one of the sides and that he is a District Attorney there prosecuting --
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2139.627,2140.335,Him.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2150.578,2151.639,"Well, Your Honor --"
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.639,2152.053,He said --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2152.053,2154.586,"-- jurors are selected for a week, the --"
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.586,2155.021,Sir?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2155.021,2158.764,The juries in Alabama are selected for that week of --
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2158.764,2160.331,The same 12?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2160.331,2161.759,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.759,2171.826,"Well, he said, Young man I had to call you back as applied and misses something that acknowledge not where they just -- near the end there, well, he says, You were here."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2175.393,2176.87,How is this jury selected?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2178.574,2178.864,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2179.168,2184.086,"-- at the beginning of the week, the sheriff brings in jurors names --"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2184.086,2184.81,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2184.81,2186.128,They're selected --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2186.128,2186.596,From the jury roll.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2186.596,2192.943,And the judge then qualifies them as to whether or not they're able to serve the jurors on account of their age.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2192.943,2193.717,That -- that is correct.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2194.658,2205.887,"And then during the week, they divide it up and the man hasn't decided a question which says special qualification in regard to a particular case, they ask questions?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2205.887,2207.166,That is correct.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2207.774,2210.797,"Or that he was qualified at the beginning of the week, I assume."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2210.797,2213.614,"Yes, this one had been qualified as to that."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.614,2224.045,"Well, on page 32, some of you gentlemen were on the jury yesterday."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2228.637,2229.269,Punishment?
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.269,2234.193,Does it vary or -- I thought you said the same 12 seat throughout the week?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2234.193,2234.499,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.071,2241.634,"Well, just one more question."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2252.648,2253.019,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.754,2260.617,"So, the jury did not have any idea at all?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2260.617,2265.92,"I -- I beg your pardon, may I quote from the actual record, record page 30."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.929,2292.7,What page is that on?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2292.7,2295.501,That is on -- that's the old rule charge --
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2295.501,2296.547,It's page 32.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2296.547,2303.982,The page is -- is it on page 32 -- page 32 in the appendix.
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2303.982,2316.336,"Well, I -- what is there that you just read that shows why you should give death in one case and ten years in another, that's my point?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2316.336,2318.386,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.386,2320.624,Is there anything other than that?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2320.624,2328.288,"No, there was no direction as to how you would do that."
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2407.507,2419.169,The -- the entire trial is between pages 10 and page 31 --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2419.169,2419.245,"Yes, --"
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2419.245,2419.583,-- of the record.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2419.583,2422.066,-- that is the entire evidence they put on.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2457.079,2471.573,"Mr. Clark I know that on the transcript on 33, as the judge says, it's not in the hands of -- it is now in the hands of the state this have pronounced the sentence."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2491.096,2491.478,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2512.234,2513.618,Is that automatic or?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2513.618,2514.023,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2544.789,2549.019,When was the last execution in Alabama?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2551.077,2551.275,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2551.275,2551.303,I remember --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2551.303,2552.295,That's has been several years.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2552.295,2553.546,-- in the entire nation.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2553.546,2564.507,In my brief I've pointed out one that was in 1964 that I handled that case through the Alabama Supreme Court and it went on to electrocution.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.019,2571.109,"It also involved a very horrible killing too, didn't it?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2571.109,2571.734,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.849,2576.553,But you did in your brief or --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2576.553,2576.875,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2576.875,2578.275,"Certainly, you can explain it freely."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2578.275,2580.604,"Well, I -- I would have politely."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2617.837,2618.706,You don't suppose the --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2618.706,2626.42,-- attacked the young lady's reputation and maybe they'd been merely held manslaughter conviction.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.42,2633.119,But all of the -- I gather that the -- all of the circumstances of the robbery including this very gruesome --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2633.119,2633.357,All they did was --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.357,2636.841,"-- it was a bizarre sort of killing where it was brought before the jury, is that correct?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2636.841,2637.658,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.658,2640.877,What he took was the young woman's car after killing.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2640.877,2644.386,"Car, jewelry and some money."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2644.386,2645.078,Yes.
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2645.078,2653.516,"May I ask Mr. Clark, is your automatic appeal statute, would it apply had Boykin got a prison sentence instead of the death sentence?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2653.516,2653.882,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2654.733,2655.509,Only whether --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2655.509,2656.227,-- death sentence.
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2666.12,2675.115,"And I gather that special statute is searching in the record, does that apply only with the automatic appeal statute applies?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2675.115,2675.564,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.67,2679.683,In all cases?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2679.683,2679.818,That's --
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.818,2681.103,All criminal pleadings.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2681.103,2681.987,-- look into the record.
1968.642,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2681.987,2684.656,I see.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2684.656,2687.07,Now the -- pardon.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2717.734,2744.634,"May I ask you further sir, let's suppose that a defendant were tried on one count of robbery then the jury has a problem of fixing the punishment, is there any -- I don't suppose there's anything like a pre-sentence report or any evidence introduced as to his history, is there?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2752.3,2752.707,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2752.707,2767.401,"-- in the ordinary pre-sentence report by the man's family background and what kind of person he's been and whether this is an isolated incident or part of a long history of crime, the sort that a judge usually ask before him?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2767.401,2767.715,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2777.719,2778.617,During the trial?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2778.617,2779.009,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2780.512,2810.853,"But suppose he had a led an exemplary life and suppose his counsel decided that for strategic reasons that he didn't want to get the question of guilt whether you did this or not makes up with the facts about the man's life which is of course kind of thing, conceivable, I'd badly described it but --"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2810.853,2811.277,Yes.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2811.277,2818.305,"-- sure, you'll agree that it is conceivable that a lawyer might make a strategic judgment of that sort."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2826.708,2827.621,That is true.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2830.049,2830.255,Well --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2830.255,2830.448,-- and I don't think the --
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2830.448,2842.648,"-- she might be a very, very critical one in which the lawyer makes the judgment in good faith and with professional competence that he later desperately regrets."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2842.648,2842.897,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2842.897,2848.368,"And his client therefore -- client is electrocuted, he probably regrets that even more."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2848.368,2852.288,I feel that that this case here represents one of those.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.064,2875.302,"Now, this trial took place September of 1966."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2875.302,2876.98,"That is correct, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.98,2881.879,And that's when the jury was in -- the panel sworn as indicated on page 10 of the appendix.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2881.879,2885.227,Correct.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.227,2904.844,"Long before this Court's decision in the Witherspoon case, so that the defense counsel was not aware of any right to challenge the jury on the basis -- the constitutional basis on which Witherspoon was decided, was corrected?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2904.844,2905.721,That is true.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2926.06,2926.265,How can you --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2926.265,2928.598,We contend that they waived that.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2928.598,2928.918,Well --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2928.918,2930.114,It was by agree --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.114,2932.672,It wasn't a known waiver though was it?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2937.215,2941.994,And that is another thing I would like to point out to this Court.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2958.353,2968.889,Is it still the law in Alabama that good character alone could be charged to the jury sufficient to generate a reasonable doubt of guilt?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2968.889,2969.302,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2971.929,2974.193,"Well, here there was a plea of guilt though so that would --"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2974.193,2974.423,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.258,2979.738,-- hardly --
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2979.738,2991.643,Is a court not inquired into the voluntariness of a plea in Alabama?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2991.643,2992.318,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2996.884,3004.017,"Well, wouldn't you think that it should be done by all means in a capital case where a man's life is at stake?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3004.017,3004.936,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.936,3007.586,Why wasn't it done here?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3007.586,3009.267,I don't know that it wasn't done Your Honor.
1968.642,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3012.031,3014.662,"Well, can you tell us whether it was or was not done?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3014.662,3014.918,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3076.417,3078.788,Who tried the case?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3078.788,3082.14,This one -- the particular one was before Judge Gillard.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3082.14,3085.63,How long has he been a judge?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3085.63,3093.215,Judge Gillard has been on the bench I think about 6 or 8 years as a circuit judge.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3097.353,3099.34,What are his initials?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3099.34,3101.732,"Walter Gillard, I believe."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3109.796,3112.844,Was he in the span of Palmer Gillard?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3112.844,3119.614,"Palmer, his brother I believe and his father was I believe Palmer Gilliard also."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.404,3150.628,"The judge -- I'm looking at page 33 of the printed appendix, in sentencing the petitioner indicated at least by negative implication of you will that he had some discretion not to follow the jury's recommendation of a death sentence."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3152.419,3152.507,Yes --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.507,3153.132,Is it --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3153.132,3154.599,-- they as a --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3154.599,3161.578,"He says in case number 15520, the court will impose a sentence according to the verdict of the jury."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3174.737,3179.307,"Notwithstanding the verdict, I believe is that the judge could send it back?"
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3179.307,3180.013,Send it back to whom?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3180.013,3180.795,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3180.795,3181.297,For what?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3181.297,3186.904,The jury didn't agree did a predetermined sentence.
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3186.904,3190.205,I wonder what kind of instructions.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3190.205,3194.246,He could instruct the jury just on that matter.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3205.769,3206.075,Well --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3206.075,3208.894,He'd already instructed them that --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3208.894,3209.347,If they could --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3209.347,3209.732,They have thought --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.732,3211.63,-- that they did have that option.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3211.63,3214.039,"Now, is there any authority from that?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3260.372,3264.236,I don't have it before me Your Honor but there have been cases where they have done that.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3264.236,3264.922,They have done it --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3264.922,3265.243,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3265.243,3266.323,-- but you don't know of any --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3266.323,3266.911,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3267.2,3269.57,-- statutory or case law --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3269.57,3269.97,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3269.97,3281.42,-- that approves it.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3281.42,3300.308,Now there was something brought out in the brief about the finding of guilty by the jury and the fixing of the sentence by that same jury violated his constitutional rights.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3413.162,3417.017,May I -- I'm sorry to ask you so many questions.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3428.453,3429.836,That is correct.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3429.836,3440.424,And the court does not -- does the court accept the guilty without more or is this a trial on the question of guilt?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3447.589,3448.012,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3449.714,3453.515,"That doesn't appear here, does it?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3460.869,3462.121,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3475.391,3476.012,To deter -- in other words --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3476.012,3479.096,To determine the sentence.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3479.096,3492.561,"So do you argue that in the sense, this is not a unitary trial, what happened here in the sense that this trial was on the question of punishment?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3492.561,3492.805,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3498.119,3501.893,And that that plea of guilty is accepted in --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3501.893,3502.308,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3502.828,3514.482,"-- in Alabama even if -- suppose this had been a murder case, is it a custom on Alabama to accept a plea of guilty?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3514.482,3522.86,Usually when they enter a plea of guilty to murder they'll enter a plea of murder to the second degree which would cover the life sentence.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3524.315,3527.194,But it's clear -- you don't know of any situation --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3527.194,3527.486,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3527.542,3527.883,-- a plea of --
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3527.883,3529.198,-- to track them --
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3529.198,3529.404,-- guilt.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3529.404,3530.402,-- first degree murder.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3530.402,3530.995,They -- they go to trial?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3530.995,3532.066,They go to trial.
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3532.24,3533.82,And they don't accept the plea of guilty.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3533.82,3534.724,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3534.724,3543.254,But despite the fact that the ultimate result may be the same here namely electrocution.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3551.367,3551.522,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3551.522,3554.339,Is that correct?
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3554.339,3560.97,"Are you saying it is a matter of law, the court is not allowed to accept a plea of guilty to first degree murder of Alabama or are you just telling that that's the practice?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3560.97,3564.271,I know of no case in which that has happened Your Honor that they held --
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3564.271,3575.851,"Well, for example in the state that -- with which I'm most familiar as a matter of law, a trial court is limited in accepting, that being allowed to accept a plea of guilty to first degree."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3579.274,3579.682,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3581.639,3584.753,You just mean as a matter of practice they cup a plea to second degree murder?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3584.753,3586.978,That's correct.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3586.978,3593.642,"Well, if they plead guilty to murder in the first degree unless it's changed that time, was it?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3593.642,3594.882,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3594.882,3616.534,"Is the law -- the judge is required to call a jury, give the jury enough evidence to show a prima facie case just that number of witnesses and to show -- give the jury enough information on which it supposedly he could -- they could rest a verdict."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3619.785,3620.212,That is not.
1968.642,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3620.212,3621.192,Has that been changed?
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3621.192,3622.349,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3625.264,3632.613,So it's not just a penalty to trial as perhaps you stated and I didn't get the implications of it.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3646.251,3653.401,"Yes, you could not have the conviction without putting on a prima facie case."
1968.642,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.401,3663.949,"But could the jury after the prima facie case goes in and the judge says lets go the jury, is the jury permitted to find him innocent?"
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3663.949,3664.87,"No, sir."
1968.642,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3666.351,3677.124,"And didn't the jury's verdict actually recite that the jury found him guilty as charged, the indictment on his plea of guilty."
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3677.124,3677.34,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3677.34,3679.003,What the verdict actually recites.
1968.642,1,20689,david_w_clark,,3679.003,3680.898,I think that's what this is.
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,3965.367,3968.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.642,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4003.511,4006.586,Isn't the sentence had been stayed?
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4006.586,4014.408,"Sir, it has been stayed by the Supreme Court of Alabama pending the hearing in this Court."
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4113.812,4113.996,You may take your --
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4113.996,4114.64,-- if I may just say it --
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4114.64,4116.979,You may make your last points.
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4116.979,4123.894,There is no automatic clemency hearing that I know of in Alabama.
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4131.389,4141.076,"Mr. Gibbons, would you mind submitting to the Court a copy of your brief in the Supreme Court of Alabama?"
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4141.076,4142.488,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4144.979,4145.325,Yes.
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4145.325,4147.348,I've submitted two briefs.
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4147.348,4148.434,"You have, you say?"
1968.642,2,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4148.434,4149.848,I -- I submitted two briefs.
1968.642,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4149.848,4150.258,"Oh, yes."
1968.642,3,20689,david_w_clark,,4160.028,4164.1,Your Honor I have copies of Mr. Gibbons' both of his briefs --
1968.642,4,22365,e_graham_gibbons,,4164.1,4164.718,Here?
1968.642,5,20689,david_w_clark,,4164.718,4165.103,"Yes, sir."
1968.642,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4166.432,4173.519,"Well, may they be submitted then Mr. -- submit to our clerk, no hurry about it, you may do it to make sure --"
1968.642,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4173.519,4176.013,"Can I have a copy the state's brief also, I guess --"
