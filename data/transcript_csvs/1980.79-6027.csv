1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.208,"We'll wait for the noise to subside, counsel."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,84.27,87.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.39,167.89,And that was a condition of the probation was it not?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,167.89,169.759,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,274.693,279.58,"On your theory, then, the Court is powerless to impose any punishments?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,279.58,287.853,"Oh no, the Court is certainly... has certain powers to enforce a... payments on the installment basis."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.099,320.824,"Well doesn't Georgia have some exemptions to its garnishment statute, for necessary expenses of living?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,320.824,330.096,"Yes, there's a certain percentage after... I think it's, it used to be 50 percent, and it's a little lower, but there's a certain percentage you can only take out for garnishment."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.348,345.455,Well so your complaint is not that a fine was levied on someone who couldn't pay it?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,345.455,347.041,Not at all.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.041,349.759,But that the fine was too high?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,349.759,350.459,Correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.023,381.528,"Mr. Zell, if you prevail here, what's going to happen: mandatory imprisonment in every case, of an indigent?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,381.528,387.432,"Well, I'd like to think, in our system of justice, that trial judges will not take that position."
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,390.57,394.938,I'm asking whether your argument might turn out to be counter productive?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,394.938,396.338,"--It could, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.246,410.632,"My other question is, have these prison sentences been served?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,410.632,411.417,In this case?
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,411.417,411.967,Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,411.967,419.804,"Oh no, they've been... the judge let them stay out on bond pending this appeal, because they would have served their sentence if they had been incarcerated."
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,419.804,421.839,So they... their sentences have been stayed?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,421.839,422.639,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,422.639,423.775,And they have not been served?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,423.775,424.741,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.741,426.491,What were the sentences?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,428.41,434.396,"Mr. Tante received... and Ms. Allen, received a 12-month sentence each."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.383,446.204,"Well, I... but the sentence was... they were put on probation first, weren't they?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,446.204,446.654,--Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.989,450.773,And then--
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,450.773,451.539,They have nine left.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.539,455.143,--And was... the probation was the same length as their sentences?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,455.143,455.743,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.743,456.26,I see.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,456.26,456.727,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.727,458.512,So they go back and serve their--
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,458.512,465.916,"Nine months less good time, which is four days a month in this case; which would be 36 days less nine months, and they'd serve about eight months."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,475.89,484.929,"--Does this record show from what resources their bond was provided, if they were indigent and couldn't pay the fine, the bond cost them some money, I suppose, in Georgia?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,484.929,485.379,--Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,492.833,496.387,What does this record show about their previous employer's practice in paying fines?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,496.387,515.681,"Well what happened was, and it's in the record, of course, that they were first fined in this case, and then thereafter they were charged again in another case, so that each one was, and a small fine was imposed and paid by their employer."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.214,541.916,Are these Petitioners here in forma pauperis?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,541.916,543.366,"--Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.366,585.462,"Well doesn't that suggest some validity to Mr. Justice Blackmun's observation, that if the people are before the Court, but not for the first time or the second time, but for the fifth time, and the Court feels that, you know, we don't want to warehouse these people and lock them up with murderers, but if we can't do anything else to them... if they are indigent, and small... or the small time fines haven't deterred them before, isn't there going to be a tendency to at least send them to the... some facility for confinement?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,585.462,588.414,"Okay, let me just relay a little chronology."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.301,633.443,"Well is that really a very commendable motive, that the employer pays their fine because they were convicted of doing something that was illegal under Georgia law?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,633.443,643.731,"Well certainly you can't enforce any agreement between the employer and the employee, it would be against public policy, like enforcing a gambling contract; he promised to pay it, in some instances he did pay the fine."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.035,659.01,"Is this a common provision in Georgia, between employees of so called adult bookstores and their employers?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,659.01,660.743,Yes and no.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,687.893,691.095,"Mr. Zell, do you have pre sentence reports in Georgia?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,691.095,691.895,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,691.895,693.547,Well don't they show how much a man is worth?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,693.547,695.43,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.43,699.284,"So the judge knew that he had enough money to pay that fine, didn't he?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,699.284,700.218,Well what happened--
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,700.218,702.07,Can I assume that?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,702.07,716.311,"--The judge knew... well here's what happened, Your Honor... being, as a practical matter, when they were convicted in the first instance, the judge, Judge Alexander, was aware of what they were doing; they were making nominal amounts of money as a clerk/projectionist."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.909,740.861,"But the employer was just treating this as a cost of doing business, sort of a--"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,740.861,741.311,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,741.311,742.295,--licensing fee?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,742.295,744.48,"That's correct, sort of licensing, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,744.48,748.365,"But he is here in forma pauperis, now?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,748.365,749.249,No.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,752.017,753.017,"Oh, the employees."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,756.585,757.202,--That's right.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.202,783.636,"What would happen if the pre sentence report shows that Mr. Jones has a friend by the name of Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith will give him a thousand dollars, and they fined him a thousand dollars, and they're not working together or anything, this is just a friend; would the Court be entitled to go back on that?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,783.636,784.102,"Well,--"
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.102,789.123,On the fact that he used some bad information?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,789.123,791.392,"--Certainly, he should, the Court... again--"
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,791.392,794.11,"Well when you get through, I want to know the difference between that case and this case."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,794.11,799.831,--Well certainly he should... the judge should modify the condition of probation and the fine... if there was some misinformation.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.783,811.222,Would you at that time tell the judge that the man couldn't pay the fine?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,811.222,813.356,"--No, there was no representation made."
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.173,816.959,You'd just let the judge go down that road?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,816.959,817.325,--That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.909,822.294,Now you want to complain about the judge?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,822.294,823.279,"--Well, I mean that's--"
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.279,825.346,"You're not complaining about yourself at all, are you?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,825.346,828.181,"--Well, what happened is, the trial was over."
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.826,875.778,"But you didn't represent the third party, you represented this man?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,875.778,877.728,"--At... during the trial in the first instance, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.728,878.88,You still do?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,878.88,880.314,Represent the third party?
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.314,881.166,No.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,881.166,882.316,The defendants?
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.316,882.849,Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,882.849,883.666,Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.701,886.468,You were not a court appointed counsel?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,886.468,888.585,"That's correct, I was not."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,888.585,895.556,"So he's here as an indigent, in forma pauperis, but he has paid counsel, then, I take it?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,895.556,896.108,No.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.874,953.742,You received a call from the Court.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,953.742,965.784,"Several... from the defendants, from the Court, from the solicitor... concerning the hearing, I received a notice of the hearing date, and of course, the defendants called me and notified me that they were in some trouble and what could I do for them."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.784,967.819,But not from the third party?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,967.819,969.419,"No, that's correct; not from a third party."
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.419,972.203,"I still want to know, you represent them officially here?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,972.203,973.153,The defendants.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.153,976.189,And not the third party?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,976.189,976.774,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.121,1008.242,"It's clear, isn't it, Mr. Zell, that the monthly installment repayments were conditions of the probation?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1008.242,1008.959,Absolutely.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.959,1017.248,It was made clear that were these repayments not made the probation would be revoked and the custodial sentences would be imposed?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1017.248,1018.014,Okay.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.966,1024.235,It was made clear that it was a condition of the probation?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1024.235,1024.868,"--Absolutely, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1025.935,1046.248,"Well, would it be... and it's not contended that the prison sentences imposed, which were probated in this case temporarily, were excessive, under the law... they were authorized by statute?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1046.248,1047.433,"Within the statute, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1049.819,1073.083,"Would it be permissible for a judge to impose an authorized prison sentence and probate it, depending say, on the condition that the defendant, convicted defendant stand on his head at twelve noon every day?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1078.885,1080.387,I think that's the reach in this case.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1082.104,1090.96,"Well what, and let's say the judge knew at the time he imposed the probated sentence, that the defendant, the convict didn't know how to stand on his head?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1101.833,1109.856,"It becomes... that's correct, it was an illusory sentence, gives them a taste of liberty to see what they could raise, and if you can't raise the money, in prison you go."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.208,1118.878,"Well, from the point of view of the Defendants, isn't it better than a straight sentence from the beginning?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1118.878,1120.045,No question about it.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.781,1135.156,"Well but wasn't part of his determination the fact that they would be subject to some penalty, i.e., the payment of a fine?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1135.156,1136.206,Well--
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.206,1138.275,He didn't intend to let them off scot free?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1143.76,1145.095,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1145.829,1148.547,"Otherwise that they should be, that's the implicit condition."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1148.547,1149.631,"--No question about it, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.21,1171.496,Well we're not running the Georgia prison system.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1179.352,1184.72,"--Yes, but how does that help further the objective in this case?"
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.526,1195.528,Is that a suspect classification?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1195.528,1195.978,--Well I--
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.978,1197.747,As in San Antonio v. Rodriguz?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1197.747,1203.567,"--Well, I took the position in my brief, and I take it now, that in social and economic policies, it perhaps is not."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1226.497,1232.487,"Well you're suggesting that paying $5,000 is not somewhat painful."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1232.487,1234.403,Well it's painful if you don't have it.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1237.039,1241.759,You mean it isn't painful if you have to go out and borrow it and put a mortgage on your house?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1241.759,1244.794,"--It certainly is, if you have the financial resources to borrow the money."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.794,1245.744,If you have the house.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1245.744,1246.36,If you have the house.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.86,1252.131,Well you're not suggesting that indigents should be free from any penalty for criminal conduct?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1252.131,1253.733,--Not at all; of course not.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1253.733,1256.868,"But the consequence comes out that way, on your argument."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1256.868,1257.585,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.48,1287.387,"Well if these people are in fact, indigents as you suggest, putting them to work in community service instead of incarcerating them isn't going to enable them to support their families, is it?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1287.387,1314.439,"Well, what you do is, and this is just a suggestions, I mean not the only suggestion, is that if you give them community service work, perhaps on weekends, at nights... there are many ways to serve the community, and much more productive for the community for the system, help the society in which they committed the wrong; it's certainly much more noble than to just lock somebody up behind bars for 7 or 8 months because they don't have the money."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.538,1375.196,"But you don't question, Mr. Zell, as I understand it, that the judge, so far as the Georgia statutes went, could have imposed the prison sentence right at the outset... prison sentences, without any probation whatsoever?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1375.196,1375.846,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1378.832,1383.885,Well if he made a determination they should be on probation if they paid $500 a month?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1383.885,1384.251,"Oh no, no."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1385.518,1387.42,That's a condition of the probation to be imposed?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1387.42,1387.853,--Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1392.057,1392.791,Right.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1392.791,1395.776,"And if they don't pay that $500 a month, they are to go to jail."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.776,1396.509,Right.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1401.913,1403.147,"That's correct, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.147,1404.699,So it isn't just a condition that--
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1405.999,1408.282,"Right, that's... which is in the appendix, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.282,1409.634,Right.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1414.136,1414.855,"In this case, no."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.548,1467.071,"Yet, you concede that the judge could have sentenced them ab initio, to twelve months?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1467.071,1467.704,In the very beginning.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.704,1468.388,Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1468.388,1469.59,"That's correct, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.345,1486.634,"Well but isn't that a typical determination with a case of non violent, first or second offenders?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1486.634,1488.201,"Generally speaking, I would say so, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.54,1528.111,"Would you... what if the judge had said this,"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1574.123,1575.425,"I think so, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.957,1608.163,Are you saying that all criminal statutes that says 30 days or $100 are unconstitutional?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1608.163,1609.363,"--Under your decisions, yes."
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.363,1614.567,"I don't know whether that's true or not; I don't think we've held that, yet."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1625.525,1626.025,No.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.025,1626.958,What?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1626.958,1631.679,Only if the individual does not have the funds--
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.679,1636.481,"All right, but that's bad to apply any indigent?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1636.481,1648.721,"--Yes, or a person who has not squandered the money away, has not been negligent, willful; that seems to be the federal... at least in the circuit, I'm from the Fifth Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit, where they've reached that issue."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.721,1652.675,"What if he squandered the money, what difference does that make?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1652.675,1660.029,"Well, I think then the Court, such as in a... I'm using an analogy as in a divorce rule, in a man supporting his family."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.977,1689.948,And you think it's the function of this Court to evaluate considerations of that kind?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1689.948,1691.317,"No, it's the trial judge."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.317,1701.623,"But the, we... if you say it's a consideration there, you're, by implication, saying we must pass on that sometime."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1701.623,1702.875,Well certainly--
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.875,1705.227,And you said this was a constitutional issue.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1705.227,1706.143,--Certainly.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.994,1740.414,Well what if a man were convicted of first degree murder and had no funds?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1740.414,1740.733,Yes.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.733,1743.016,Would you say he couldn't go to jail?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1743.016,1749.839,"You mean if... well, of course, in Georgia if you are convicted of first degree murder, you must either get a life or death sentence."
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.794,1765.631,But it isn't part of the trial judge's reasoning that you want to put as few people in jail as possible.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1765.631,1766.431,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.431,1771.916,And if he knew that you couldn't--
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1771.916,1772.668,Collect the fine?
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.668,1779.505,"--collect the fine or put him in jail, he... he probably would sentence him to jail in the first place."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1779.505,1782.391,"Well, I'm going to take it from a theoretical point of view, if I may."
1980.79-6027,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1885.524,1901.051,"Well what it comes down to is to find a punishment that is available for imposition on him and I suppose some people, due to circumstances, are free from any punishment except going to jail."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1901.051,1902.886,Free from paying money.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.881,1927.918,Would you object if the Court had a hearing to find out if this man could pay $10.00 a week?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1927.918,1929.037,Not at all.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.603,1932.672,"Well I thought so, but you weren't saying it right then."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1932.672,1933.189,--That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.472,1935.574,All right.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1935.574,1940.126,"--In fact I asked the judge, I said look judge, reduce the fine, let's make it commensurate."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.674,1962.324,Your time is up.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1982.338,1983.038,I don't think so.
1980.79-6027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.943,1993.729,"Mr. Zell, let me ask you one more question."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2017.093,2023.08,I'm sure many defendants have said that to the trial judge; I certainly wouldn't advise this Court that I was represented to say that.
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.739,2048.58,"Mr. Zell, I don't want to repeat myself, but the determination that the sentencing judge made was that he would continue him on probation so long as he paid $10.00 per month."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2048.58,2049.03,I think--
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.03,2051.016,It wasn't an unconditional determination.
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2051.016,2052.934,"--No, it was conditioned on paying the money, that's correct."
1980.79-6027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.934,2053.984,Among other conditions?
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2053.984,2054.518,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.494,2078.249,"And other people who could satisfy that condition, but... and who could satisfy all the conditions stayed out of jail?"
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2078.249,2080.201,"Who could pay the money, could stay out of jail."
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.297,2104.834,"Well as one of my colleagues noted, it isn't our business to try to write Georgia's statute on that subject."
1980.79-6027,0,26354,glenn_zell,,2104.834,2107.753,But certainly it's available to the judge under Georgia law.
1980.79-6027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.786,2112.639,Mr. Dunsmore.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2112.639,2116.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.22,2172.861,"Mr. Attorney General, suppose a man has got the money and he is sentenced to pay $5,000 a month, which is no problem to him."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2186.705,2203.482,"Yes, he can always go through it in Georgia, at any time, the Courts... we pointed that out in the footnotes, the Court always has the inherent power to modify a sentence or to release the individual from the conditions of his probation at that time."
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.003,2213.872,You go to the sentencing judge?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2213.872,2222.961,"You go to the sentencing judge because he retains jurisdiction over that case, during that time that the individual is on a period of probation."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.307,2266.74,What was the amount of that bond?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2266.74,2283.868,"Now the bond for Mr. Wood is $20,000, and under the Georgia statutory scheme, the maximum amount... or, the amount that would have to be paid for that bond, according to my figures, would be $1,025."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.886,2319.023,Is there anything in the record to indicate where this indigent got the money to pay that?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2319.023,2321.158,"No, and I think that gets into--"
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.158,2323.192,"Well if it's not in the record, I don't want you to pursue it."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2324.877,2354.646,"--I think the interesting part of the case, though, which the Court can consider, is in our Appendix A, which is the revocation proceeding in January of 1979, Mr. Zell told the sentencing judge, the trial judge, Judge Alexander that these individuals' previous fines in connection with other cases, had been paid and that he had paid them."
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.929,2357.715,You said previous fines?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2357.715,2358.998,--That is correct.
1980.79-6027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2358.998,2363.269,"Perhaps I misundertsood Mr. Zell, but I thought that this was their first conviction."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2363.269,2364.035,All right.
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.835,2450.108,Well the could the judge have revoked the then pending probation because of that conviction of a subsequent crime?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2450.108,2453.994,"--Yes, he could have, I believe... well, I believe he could have."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2507.546,2515.183,"What does the record show, if anything, about who paid the bond or the fee of $1,000, or more?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2515.183,2519.401,"Now, the bond as to--"
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.401,2526.305,"The bond for the... continued liberty, while this case is--"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2526.305,2526.689,--Well I--
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.689,2528.524,--Isn't there something in--
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2528.524,2538.196,"--Mr. Chief Justice Burger, it was not until the 27th of October that I found out that these individuals had a bond posted."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2553.558,2559.628,--Well wasn't there some statement by counsel at one of these hearings that the employer had paid the bonds--
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2559.628,2565.366,"--Oh Mr. Chief Justice Burger, yes, that's in regard to... well, two things."
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.322,2607.626,"--Mr. Attorney General, if that's true, why wasn't the owner arrested?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2607.626,2613.43,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I have no idea, and I cannot speak for the solicitor of Fulton County."
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.43,2613.863,I understand.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2613.863,2638.062,"Now these individuals also indicated... and I think the representation is, too, properly to the Court, that here, the employer has... the employer even told one of them, I believe it was Mr. Tante, there was an indication in the probation revocation hearing, well how did you know to get Mr. Zell?"
1980.79-6027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.729,2680.491,"Mr. Dunsmore, let me ask you one question about the appendix on page 21, and it's in the last paragraph there where that court states, and this is the trial court, order of probation,"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2706.406,2708.574,"--None on the record, now."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.808,2867.628,Did they ever ask the Court to reduce the amount of the installments and put them over a longer period of time?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,2867.628,2874.982,"No, there was no effort made at any time to reduce the installments or to seek anything else."
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.89,3016.092,Isn't the judge a part of the whole thing?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3016.092,3017.011,--A party?
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3017.011,3023.08,How can a judge take the word of a man who is the criminal?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3023.08,3026.782,"Well, I think it's... in any case--"
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3026.782,3031.936,And the only thing that the owner is doing is paying additional taxes.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3031.936,3034.603,"--I don't consider it paying additional taxes, and I think--"
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3034.603,3050.498,"If the agreement is understood between the prosecution, the defense and the judge, that the guilty party will pay the fine of the guys that are convicted."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3050.498,3051.548,--Well I think we're going one--
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.548,3054.334,"Is that all, that's understood?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3056.819,3060.621,"--Well let me explain that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.097,3076.399,I thought you said that that was stated in open court.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3076.399,3078.582,I don't believe that the solicitor stated it in open court.
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.582,3081.817,"I didn't say the solicitor, I said somebody did."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3081.817,3082.969,"Right, and that was the Petitioners--"
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3082.969,3083.553,And the solicitor--
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3083.553,3084.103,--in this case.
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3084.103,3084.905,"--was there, wasn't he?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3084.905,3085.555,That's correct.
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3085.555,3087.255,"So he heard it, didn't he?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3087.255,3088.357,Right.
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.001,3110.37,Would it be the same as a dote?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3110.37,3111.253,Would it be the same as--
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3111.253,3117.376,That the King tendered a dote says to the Court that I'll pay the fine for these guys?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3117.376,3117.992,--I think you could say--
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.992,3118.776,Would that be all right?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3118.776,3119.842,"--I think you could say, because--"
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.842,3121.178,Would that be all right?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3121.178,3127.498,--Isn't that an indication that he's got a stake in this individual and that he's going to conform his conduct to the law?
1980.79-6027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3127.498,3129.032,And you think the Court would go along with that?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3129.032,3146.36,"Well I don't know, but I think it's a reasonable basis, a rational basis for the Court to consider; that if somebody's going to pay some money out for them, are they going to continue to hire this individual and why would they pay the fines if they thought that the conduct... to continue, would they continue to violate the law?"
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.686,3166.207,"Mr. Dunsmore, I'm not sure I understood why you think all of this is relevant."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3212.088,3214.488,That is correct and the Court of Appeals just said--
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.488,3221.027,"Well what difference does it make about third parties, or what the agreement was or what the anticipation of the judge was?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3221.027,3222.677,--Well because--
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.677,3230.133,Because the Court of Appeals took it on the assumption it could not... that it had been determined that they were financially unable to pay.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3230.133,3231.583,--Well the Court of Appeals--
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.583,3242.54,"Why don't you just defend that... which you do, I'm sure, you defend that... that even if they couldn't pay, and were unable to pay, it was quite constitutional to put them in jail?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3242.54,3243.256,--Right.
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.69,3244.725,Isn't that your position?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3244.725,3245.242,--That's correct.
1980.79-6027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.979,3253.312,"No, I--"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3253.312,3256.7,"--you know, 12 months, $5000 fine."
1980.79-6027,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3264.937,3283.867,"--And what if the sentencing judge had known at the time he imposed the... as a condition of probation... that the convicted defendants repay $500 a month, what if he'd known at that very moment that there was no possibility at all that the defendants could repay?"
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3283.867,3285.017,Well that question is--
1980.79-6027,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3285.017,3286.385,Isn't that just the equivalent--
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3286.385,3297.441,"--a little more, that's a little more difficult to add, and I think that assumes... and would put us in a more difficult position, because there, there's an indication of vindictiveness."
1980.79-6027,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.178,3312.634,--What if he had been morally certain that the defendants couldn't meet one or more of the other conditions of probation?
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3312.634,3326.377,"Well I agree, I think it makes it far more difficult, because they are... impuning bad faith to the judge and I don't think, on the record here, there's anything to impune lack of judicial integrity on the part of the sentencing judge."
1980.79-6027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.816,3348.741,"Mr. Attorney General Dunsmore, I got the impression from your adversary that the problem presented by this case is somewhat unique to Georgia."
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3350.409,3366.685,"Well I'm not too sure of... when he said unique to Georgia... I take it, in terms of the fact that judges don't place individuals on, let's say, spend five nights in the county jail or work for a health facility."
1980.79-6027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.701,3396.205,--But his suggestion seems supported by the fact we've had two previous cases from Georgia where parole was revoked because of inability to pay a fine.
1980.79-6027,1,30070,john_w_dunsmore_jr,,3401.609,3404.494,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, I couldn't... couldn't tell you that."
1980.79-6027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3537.579,3538.362,"Thank you, gentlemen."
