1956.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.904,"Number 18, on calendar, the United States, Petitioner, versus The Western Pacific Railroad Company."
1956.18,0,36055,morton_hollander,,18.14,21.911,May it please the Court.
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1974.154,1976.136,The Court please.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2136.783,2144.903,On -- on what basis may the Comptroller General not honor the bill that's presented by the carrier since he got it?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2144.903,2153.06,"He will simply say and apply as here an erroneous rule of transportation law and say, â€œThis wasn't the proper rate."
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2155.662,2156.945,Did you say as here?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2159.088,2163.855,"In this rate, in this case, the articles were billed as incendiary bombs."
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2177.591,2181.358,"That's a rate -- is neither one nor the other that the Government spoke of, is that it?"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2181.358,2181.852,Yes.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2213.155,2215.37,"But, I still haven't got it included in my opinion."
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2222.087,2222.855,"He did, yes."
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2223.082,2227.79,I just want to know is to -- to what will be deducted?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2227.79,2230.134,The subsequent bills for the same carriers.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2230.134,2235.096,"Not -- what subject matter -- on -- and on what basis did he say, doesn't fall under the incendiary case?"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2235.096,2238.728,He said -- he -- he did it on the basis of the combination rule.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2238.876,2239.95,That's -- that's the different one from --
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2239.95,2240.661,Rule 17.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2240.661,2242.902,"-- either one that we encountered here, is it?"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2242.902,2258.67,"Well the -- the Government now, have to -- on its third position has got around to saying that the arguing that the combination rule was proper because all the ingredients for fifth class, therefore, the entire entity was fifth-class which of course hasn't been the law."
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2258.67,2263.681,How long -- how long after the -- the deduction was made by the Comptroller General?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2266.275,2267.132,Within the six years.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2267.59,2268.339,I beg your pardon?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2268.339,2270.61,Within the six-year period.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2270.61,2273.903,But was that over to?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2286.292,2273.903,I don't know.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2295.91,2312.977,"Am I to infer from your answer to Chief Justice's question, you do not know the time period that that is irrelevant in that the settlement by the Comptroller General, unilateral action by him as it were quite clean up the whole slate, is that your position?"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2312.977,2313.579,Yes.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2365.556,2371.865,When does the Government know that the rate which they are now claiming and this suit claim was unreasonable?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2375.91,2378.511,"Well, I would say when the bill was presented."
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2378.511,2379.056,And -- and?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2379.056,2402.249,Which was well within two years of the time that the shipment was made I -- I assume that because railroads don't ordinarily wait two years to bill shippers so they knew it then and they could have -- they could -- so the -- the heart of the case is what is the nature of the limitations provision on applying to the Commission for determination of reasonableness vel non.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2740.737,2742.668,Where is the stipulation Colonel?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2742.668,2751.565,"The stipulation as to the Western Pacific case is record 5, item 2."
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2751.565,2752.78,Thank you.
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2752.78,2755.783,The -- in the other cases we've been -- I mentioned it in the brief.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2781.68,2782.336,May I ask you --
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2782.336,2782.778,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2782.778,2786.622,-- what -- what did you say the effect of the stipulation was?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2786.622,2808.397,The effect of the stipulation was that in determining the nature of the shipments here and in determining whether there was any question of fact left open by reason of the affidavits filed below in response -- in opposition to the carriers' motion for summary judgment whether there was any question of fact.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2836.946,2854.751,"Well, as I read -- as I read this, all the stipulation does is to say that the articles transported in these cases, in these instances are like the articles transported in Union Pacific --"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2854.751,2854.847,Yes.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2854.847,2855.685,-- case number --
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2855.685,2855.884,Yes.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2855.884,2857.19,-- 49505.
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2864.274,2878.89,"That -- that's the substance of -- of good deal of the reply brief, I say that the present cases are entirely different from Union Pacific and respondents attempt to rely on the decision rendered on the record as developed in the latter case is plainly unwarranted."
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2878.89,2884.493,"Now, Colonel, that -- that doesn't quite meet the point I -- I make."
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2906.721,2908.494,Well that's -- that's the way I read his brief.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2908.494,2910.866,"Well, where in his brief does he say that?"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2916.703,2918.049,That's on page 8.
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2931.243,2938.4,"Well, Colonel, isn't that entirely different from saying that the -- that the items transported were similar to those --"
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2938.4,2938.714,Well --
1956.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2938.714,2939.622,-- in the two cases?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2940.788,2947.988,The only points urged for differences are points that are covered in the Union Pacific case.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2974.998,2976.885,+Before you -- before you do that.
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,3004.89,3005.426,Yes.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3005.426,3006.288,-- as follows.
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,3006.288,3007.358,Yes.
1956.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3008.338,3014.614,It seems to me to mean anything except that the Union Pacific case is controlling in determining the recovery in this case?
1956.18,1,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,3014.614,3015.686,"Yes, yes."
1956.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3017.813,3020.843,I do not -- I do not understand how can read that conclusion --
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4093.365,4096.063,"Your Honor, there are three cases involved in this litigation."
1956.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4161.243,4164.301,The Government paid promptly in the Aroostook and the Seaboard?
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4164.301,4165.015,Yes.
1956.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4165.527,4168.185,That is to say in 1944 (Inaudible)
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4168.185,4168.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4176.343,4178.6,The shipment was in 1944 when the payments were made?
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4178.6,4180.343,"Yes., Your Honor."
1956.18,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4180.343,4194.171,"Mr. Hollander, are these deductions made by the Government under this permissive act isolated instances or does it happen as a matter of daily routine, do you know?"
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4194.171,4197.232,"I -- I don't know the -- the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1956.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4287.214,4297.256,"Well, you would admit, don't you that the I.C.C. is a more informed body to determine what classification tariff, what classification apply to the General Accounting Office."
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4315.3,4317.519,"Well, I -- I agree, Your Honor."
1956.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4332.305,4334.59,I didn't question what Congress has ordered --
1956.18,2,36055,morton_hollander,,4334.59,4357.054,"And -- and the -- the Government notwithstanding the First Circuit decision that Colonel Wiener relies on, the -- the Government is never before had to establish the correctness of the deduction or the illegality of an overpayment before these deductions are effected."
