2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.78,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1500, Eric Cornell Clay versus The United States."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,56.376,59.695,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.202,128.352,Are you talking about now our retroactivity cases?
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,128.352,129.487,--Not merely retro--
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.487,130.005,The--
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,130.005,144.605,"--Those included, Mr. Chief Justice, but also cases like Barefoot versus Estelle, dealing with the presumption of correctness, and also Bell versus Maryland, which addresses the question of when a statute is repealed, when does that repeal affect... what... what convictions does it affect?"
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.605,146.875,"--Well, those come from quite diverse contexts."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,146.875,149.836,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, in effect, our point."
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.601,200.652,"Well, Link... Linkletter was really a bygone era by the time Congress passed AEDPA."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,200.652,204.156,"Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the point still would favor us."
2002.01-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,245.676,279.335,"I thought that their... amicus wrote, you know, a pretty good argument on that side, and I thought one of his better points, which is that if we're looking at the... the 1-year limitation from a person in State proceedings, what it says is, it runs from the latest of the date on which judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review, or the expiration of time for seeking such review; and then when you look to the parallel for somebody in Federal proceedings, it says it becomes final from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,291.12,292.385,I understand.
2002.01-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,311.862,326.093,"Oh, no, it doesn't, see, because you have became final by the conclusion of direct review, and then we have the date on which judgment of conviction became final, and he's saying that he would interpret it so they mean the same thing."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,326.093,336.349,"Ah, but he wouldn't, and here's the reason, and let... let me just take you very carefully through this, and for anyone who wants to look it up, it's the blue brief on page 1 would be the different statutory provisions."
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.254,378.939,"Well, but the... the... that doesn't... the sentence doesn't end with judgment became final."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,384.301,389.499,"--That's right, so what we have, Mr. Chief Justice, is 2244, Congress explicates a phrase."
2002.01-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.357,407.828,"So you are saying that in the... within 2244(d)(1), those words are surplusage, they don't do anything, that... the... that 2244 would mean the same thing if there were a period after ""became final""."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,407.828,413.684,"--Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that we think it would mean the same thing even if it weren't there, but it's not surplusage."
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.045,497.633,But... but you're going to get State post-conviction review in connection with Federal habeas cases because of the exhaustion requirement.
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,497.633,517.399,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is our point, and that is that Congress really needed to do a better... a very good job, as... as good as they did in AEDPA in any context, but they needed to do a good job in telling Federal habeas cases in the 20... courts in the 2244 context when the judgment of conviction became final, because if 20--"
2002.01-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.399,549.422,"Well, but you can also say that they had to give a special meaning of finality so that we could respect the processes of the States and make it clear that the... all of the State procedures had to be exhausted, as the Chief Justice indicated, because of the intrusive nature of... of habeas jurisprudence, of habeas orders from the Federal courts, and so you can read this as... as being an exception to this general Federal rule when, in fact... that brings me to another point... you can address both."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,566.338,587.102,"--Justice Kennedy, this is the second point on the question of do... does this Court have some reason to believe that the presence in 24... excuse me, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort of Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it would rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1) is unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual."
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.129,677.308,"When you're... when you're appealing from the district court to the court of appeals, when does the term, final... what does the term of final mean there, as to the district court judgment?"
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,677.308,680.702,"In this... in... in our view, under 2255, Mr. Chief Justice, or--"
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.702,680.925,Yes.
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,680.925,683.365,"--It... it does not become final, in our view."
2002.01-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.792,693.668,"Well, characterize for... for us, then, your understanding of the amicus view."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,700.022,704.606,"--Well, Mr.... Justice Kennedy, I do agree with you that that's the amicus's view."
2002.01-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,713.342,720.039,"Oh, I should think the normal rule does include the tolling exception that I... that I... we've just explained."
2002.01-1500,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,720.039,744.463,"--Justice Kennedy, as a matter of... for example, Melconian, if we go back to what this Court has described as the normal background understanding, the normal background understanding is that just when it's entered by the district court; but if, again if I could come back to my basic point, and that is, we all agree final can mean a lot of things, and the closest one, it seems perfectly clear, is the one that divides direct and collateral review, because that's what this provision does."
2002.01-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.883,765.413,"Very well, Mr. Goldstein."
2002.01-1500,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,767.672,774.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.651,800.211,What about an appeal from the district court to the court of appeals?
2002.01-1500,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,800.211,809.195,The judgment would become final if there... if no appeal was filed at the time... when the time to file an appeal expired after the 10-day period.
2002.01-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.195,812.471,"And yet that's contrary to a lot of other things, is it not?"
2002.01-1500,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,823.79,827.03,"Well, we're talking about finality for... for a different purpose here."
2002.01-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.605,841.746,Why... why should those be different?
2002.01-1500,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,841.746,855.008,"--Well, in... in terms of... of collateral review, first of all the Congress used the particular phrase, when the judgment becomes final, that has an established meaning in that context."
2002.01-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.375,889.906,Except that... except that they wrote the two sections differently.
2002.01-1500,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,892.207,904.965,"Well, that... that... well, I'm talking about a... a reason why they would have intended that result as opposed to a... a canon or a textual indication that there might be a difference, but even as to the textual indication--"
2002.01-1500,2,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1412.67,1418.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1500,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3066.135,3067.494,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-1500,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.34,3099.568,Which set of Rule 33 are we talking about?
2002.01-1500,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3099.568,3101.911,"Before the 1998 amendment, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-1500,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.911,3102.812,"To what set, what--"
2002.01-1500,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3102.812,3104.915,"I apologize, to criminal procedure."
2002.01-1500,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.915,3105.662,--Criminal procedure.
2002.01-1500,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3105.662,3107.055,I do apologize.
