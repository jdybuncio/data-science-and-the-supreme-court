1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.65,"We will hear arguments next in 75-62, Runyon against McCrary and the related and consolidated cases."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,67.269,80.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Justices, I represent the Bobbe's School which is Mr. and Mrs. Runyon operating."
1975.75-62,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.711,399.662,"Well, why is that any difficult that an employer says, we should have, as a private employer, the right to choose whom he wants to as his employee?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,399.662,434.419,"Well because I think as the dissent pointed out in this case, in the Runyon case that this right of association is personal situations that come into play in the private school, and I think parents, if the parent has the right, as this court said in the Pierce case, to select a school on the education for its children, then I say that this is a concomitant right on the private school to select the student it wants to educate, and I feel that that right has to be a fundamentally protected right."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.349,525.958,Except the statute says that all persons should have the right but to make and enforce contracts?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,525.958,526.459,Exactly.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.459,543.419,"And what you say is certainly correct as I remember my contract from law school except that if a school, your client, says we will never ever make any offered to anybody at the Negro race."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,552.558,556.111,"Well now, we are assuming as we are here that this is purely private school."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.111,556.251,"Yes, well it is."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,556.251,562.21,"My answer is no, and if it is and this area goes to my views I may disagree with it."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.912,567.148,But I was talking about the application of the statute?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,567.148,574.11,"No, I say no, it does not apply with that because in citing the Civil Rights Case of 1883, we bring them forward."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.563,582.91,Well I was trying -- My questioning went to the wording of the statute.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,603.95,615.824,"Well, maybe in the pure sense it would, but in the sense of a right and a duty that the contract would bring into play then I say that that statute cannot do that because it cannot force a person to undergo a contract he does not wish to."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.678,641.02,"Now, I suppose the matter of contract law, and your client would make the offer and the applicant would make the acceptance or is it the other way?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,641.02,645.226,"Well, it seems to me that the offer has to come from the other way."
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,645.226,647.866,"You invite the offer, is that your theory?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,647.866,654.187,"Exactly, exactly correct like you invite a guest in your home and that is exactly the predicate that I am operating Your Honor."
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,654.187,669.427,Let us suppose a man is running in contracting business and he puts  an ad in the paper saying that he needs seven bricklayers and five plumbers and what not.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,672.134,673.819,But he also has the right to refuse it.
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,673.819,675.652,Oh yes! But he is inviting applications?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,675.652,676.947,Yes sir.
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,676.947,688.406,"But if he announce or practice a universal refusal to employ any person of a particular race, where would he be?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,688.406,695.878,"Well, of course, depending on whether he have any federal involvement or state involvement, absent that --"
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.878,697.86,He is building an interstate highway.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,697.86,706.756,"He has got the right absent what the criteria have been as set out in prior court precedents, he has that right."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.101,711.013,But that is a statute; that is on the statute --
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,711.013,711.307,That is a statute --
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.307,724.359,"That is a statue that certainly he has unless there is state action or state involvement, but there is a statute covering the Chief Justice’s question, Title VII, and there is a statute here, and the question is, does it apply this to situation?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,725.063,727.203,That is right and I say it does not.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,741.774,745.324,"You also disagree with Smith against Allwright, do you not?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,763.043,764.669,"Well, except for one thing."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.94,787.852,Which decision?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,787.852,789.833,The 1883 Civil Rights Decision.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.833,792.009,"Well, I am talking about Smith against Allwright."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,792.009,792.913,I understand that but --
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.913,799.867,Smith against Allwright says he do not have that unlimited right to associate with only whom he wants to associate with.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,799.867,804.243,"Well, that literally -- I just do not go on with that argument."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.243,805.615,You mean you do not go along with the decision?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,805.615,807.78,"Well, if that is a decision. I do not go along with the decision."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.78,811.9,The decision is saying you could not ban Negroes from voting in the primary in Texas?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,811.9,812.528,"Well yes, but you --"
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,812.528,813.317,Clearly.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,813.317,814.446,Right but you are talking about a --
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.446,817.643,And the Civil Rights cases said to the contrary.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,817.643,819.339,But you are talking about the voting right now.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.339,823.787,"No, I am talking about the right that they said it was a right to assemble."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,823.787,824.234,That is right.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.234,825.493,And the right to be together.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,835.88,839.532,"Well, of course they must have made that argument with tongue-in-cheek that deals with voting right."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.524,847.739,And you say there is no state action in it at all?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,858.228,859.007,The state action --
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.007,860.301,I assume they pay taxes.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,860.301,862.04,I would assume so but I really do not know.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.04,863.807,Do you think school pays property taxes?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,863.807,866.22,I would hope so but some schools do not.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.898,871.934,Do they meet the requirements of the Virginia Educational Laws?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,871.934,873.114,Are you talking about the school that I represent?
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.114,874.482,Yes sir.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,874.482,882.99,"Well, you know the private schools in Virginia, at least this one is not regulated other than having a certificate, and that is the only type of thing that they have to meet."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,887.232,892.751,And they have a certificate and they are not periodically examined by the state?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,892.751,897.345,For health reasons or fire prevention reasons that type of thing.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,909.627,912.741,The state law does not give the right to refuse Negroes.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,912.741,936.221,"I am not saying that the state law does, what I said is that insofar as a private individual is concerned, and I am of course taking the position of private school, that is purely private school as it has the same rights, and that is a right that is the personal right, that is a God-given right for you to live with, and that is what I think what separates the democracy from other nations."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.792,942.043,This is no home.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,944.46,945.991,It is a home in the sense that is a private establishment Mr. Justice.
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,945.991,946.754,It is not a home.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.754,951.432,"Mr. Koutoulakos, could you tell us a little about the school, how many students are there?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,951.432,954.076,About 155 in that area.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.076,955.44,And what grades?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,955.44,957.047,They run up to the second grade.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.047,959.058,"Just Kindergarten, first grade and second grade?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,959.058,960.319,"And second grade, yes sir."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.319,961.196,Boys and girls?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,961.196,961.861,Boys and girls.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,961.861,963.05,About 155?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,963.05,964.178,About 155.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.178,966.403,All drawn from the immediate area?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,966.403,969.579,"In that –- Well, yes I would say generally."
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.579,970.139,They have both --
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.139,972.336,All day long a half day?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,972.336,975.422,Both half day and all day and they do have --
1975.75-62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.422,977.457,Yeah I have seen the presents.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,977.457,983.383,"And it is a very fine school, as a matter of fact that man that runs it used to be and his wife used to be (Inaudible)."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,986.835,987.972,How long is the school been in existence?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,987.972,990.85,Since the late 50s.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.399,1013.114,But I thought it was the question.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1014.987,1019.787,"Now there are, yes, because since the decision came down, they did apply."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.787,1021.16,But not at the time of this lawsuit?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1021.16,1022.184,But it was none -- at that time --
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.184,1028.434,"The question is, whether the school can practice a policy and complete racial exclusion."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1029.221,1034.521,"That is the question, yes, that is at least before this Court and we take the position that is private school, it can."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.125,1037.114,And that is the issue.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1037.114,1039.125,That is the issue; that is squarely the issue.
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1039.294,1044.044,And what you have done since this lawsuit started is not relevant to issue here?
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1044.044,1045.51,"No, not at all."
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1084.811,1090.204,"Well, the point is that the legislature acted here when we have statute to construe, that is the only issue?"
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1090.204,1093.4,"That is right, but the interpretation of statute if –-"
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.4,1095.49,That is not an issue here.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1095.49,1105.356,"I like the dissent and I guess it seems like I am mostly on dissent side that the Honorable Justice White and Justice Harlan had, and I think that pretty well covers it, just like there is a --"
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1105.356,1108.225,That was a different statutory provision; that was Section 1982.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1108.225,1109.349,1982.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.349,1110.633,And this is 1981.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1110.633,1111.143,But we are talking about --
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.143,1112.825,It is a different language and maybe a different history.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1112.825,1114.054,"No, we are talking about private discrimination --"
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.054,1116.678,But certainly you would agree that it has different language.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1116.678,1118.338,Well 1980 --
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1118.338,1119.33,"I would think you would, because I think it might help your case."
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1119.33,1127.034,Yes it does but I am saying though that the Justices went into the history of private and non-private discrimination and its application.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1150.63,1153.96,That case arose under Section 1982.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1156.299,1159.021,981 is what is discussed in the Cook case.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.021,1160.784,Yes but Jones against Mayer was 19 –-
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1160.784,1161.708,1982.
1975.75-62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.708,1162.455,That is all it is got to do.
1975.75-62,0,34678,louis_koutoulakos,,1162.455,1173.177,"That is all it is and it is exactly right that 1981 only comes in by illusion, you are absolutely correct and I would like to leave it with that and leave 1981 exactly, I would like to argue."
1975.75-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1222.666,1230.351,Very well.
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1232.375,1236.35,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.74,1257.109,The pupils are boys and girls?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1257.109,1258.193,"Boys and girls, Your Honor."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.193,1260.421,In what classes or grades?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1260.421,1266.413,From pre-kindergarten up through the sixth grade.
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.372,1288.529,Does it now have other than white children?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1288.529,1289.105,Yes sir.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1318.396,1320.306,You better be careful with that advice.
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1320.306,1321.983,What is that sir?
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.983,1326.507,You better be a little careful with that advice and otherwise too.[Laughter]
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1326.507,1337.887,"Your Honor, it is a problem getting back into court again on this and we do not want to get back in the court again on it and we believe in being careful."
1975.75-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.089,1688.239,"But then they caught nearest to that to, the Supreme Court in 100 in Ex parte Virginia,  Strauder versus Virginia and Virginia against Rives did not understand that at all, did they?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1688.239,1691.507,"Perhaps not, if they did -- I do not think those cases apply to schools"
1975.75-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1691.507,1693.193,They were closer than you were?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1693.193,1696.139,I do not recall -- I do not believe Your Honor that they apply to school.
1975.75-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1696.139,1698.152,"No, juries, that is what you said."
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1699.744,1702.25,That is not what these men intended.
1975.75-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.35,1707.073,"And so the Supreme Court, in that time, did not quite understand well?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1707.073,1707.909,The Supreme Court later –-
1975.75-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.909,1710.415,Because they said they did have a right to juries?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1710.415,1712.972,"Your Honor, I am talking about the intent of Congress."
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.074,1784.701,We will resume there at 1 o’clock.
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1787.011,1798.111,Thank you sir. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1847.688,1850.406,"Were they talking, do you think, about public schools or private schools?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1850.406,1861.17,"Your Honor, they did not distinguish, I think they were talking, but they were concerned with the idea that the objected to was the children attending the same school."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.539,1868.025,"In many parts of the country, there were not public schools in those days."
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,1868.025,1869.3,That may be true.
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.363,2028.204,"Well, would the issue of contract come up with respect to public school attendance?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2028.204,2030.279,"Well Your Honor, it is a property right."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.032,2053.443,"It is a statutory entitlement in those states and I supposed that includes now all the 50 states where there is an absolute statutory right to go to a public school, but it is only by reason of that."
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2053.443,2074.099,"Your Honor, when the Congress enacted that language and they selected that language, of course, they were trying -- the mischief they were seeking to correct or is the reenactment, in effect, the reenactment of the Slave Codes or new Black Codes which simply continued the disabilities that the slaves had had before the abolition of slavery."
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2085.869,2099.712,"In that setting Mr. Lipscomb, would sophisticated people such as you would have in the Congress, including lawyers speak of the right to attend the public school in contract terms?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2099.712,2100.574,I do not think they would.
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.468,2123.616,"They might conceivably do that with respect to higher education on that day that is colleges and universities where you pay a large tuition or you have admission requirements, conceivably that would be embraced in terms of contract?"
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2123.616,2155.391,"Conceivably Your Honor and I would not quarrel with that, but I wanted to move if I might to the Thirteenth Amendment very briefly and to point out to the Court that the Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment are virtually identical in language, are really quite different in scope, and that is because the subject matter of two amendments is so vastly different."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.953,2173.319,But the Fourteenth Amendment does confront itself to restrictions upon the states.
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2173.319,2174.122,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2199.266,2202.254,But they could be retained as they were in the Black Codes?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2202.254,2216.667,"No, I mean to say they could be -- the authority of Congress to enact appropriate legislation could not enlarge the incidents and add to them to those that existed and which were abolished when slavery was abolished."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2217.164,2223.049,But the Congress had the power under Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to eliminate the vestiges of slavery?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2223.049,2225.76,I do not know about the word vestiges Your Honor.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.388,2236.038,Why do you think Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment did mean then?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2236.038,2251.629,That they might enforce the abolition of slavery by appropriate legislation and not go beyond slavery itself in voluntary service and necessary incidents that were understood by the people at that time to be part slavery.
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.72,2261.623,Well how about the ability to leave a capacity to own property?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2261.623,2263.121,"Yes, Your Honor, they did mean that."
1975.75-62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.121,2264.033,And to make contract?
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2264.033,2265.722,"Yes, they did mean that Your Honor."
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2279.69,2284.494,"Mr. Lipscomb if you are contemplating reserving any time for rebuttal, you are now in your last five minutes."
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2284.494,2286.413,I do not think I am going to be able to reserve any time.
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.413,2288.302,Very well.
1975.75-62,1,16444,andrew_a_lipscomb,,2288.302,2295.366,That private schools and public schools are quite different.
1975.75-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.867,2388.443,Mr. Leonard.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2388.443,2393.138,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.263,2595.323,There are certainly some limitations on that though?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2600.807,2604.706,"Well, as I said, there is a minimum requirement."
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.965,2728.069,"Well, why is the state not or this case, Congress if indeed Congress did say so, free to say that just as important as reading and writing arithmetic is learning in an integrated environment?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2728.069,2736.829,"You are quite right Mr. Justice Rehnquist and if they said so, what I am trying to address myself to at this moment is exactly that point."
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.829,2738.688,I will not distract you.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2738.688,2743.815,This point was made in point five of the brief of this intervenor.
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2772.062,2780.214,But you concede that even though a parent might want education for his children which was totally deficient in the three I’s.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2787.217,2789.526,"No, I do not go that far at all."
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.737,2805.253,"But it is not some a question of what the child is entitled to, it is the question of what limits the state can put on the choice of the parents?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2805.253,2806.92,How far can the state go?
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2864.102,2867.738,Do you think that is still good law?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2867.738,2872.515,"As a matter of fact, yes; I do believe it is good law Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.932,2964.245,Do you know of any private “all black” school that excludes people?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2964.245,2964.724,Yes your honor.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2966.297,2967.544,Where?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2967.544,2971.468,"The Academy of Sedalia, North Carolina, very good one it is too."
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.468,2972.951,It is a Negro School?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2972.951,2975.26,To the best of my knowledge it is a 100% black school.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.26,2978.505,But it does not -- it excludes white students?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2978.505,2988.088,"Well, like the gentleman who we were with up this morning, I do not know what exclusion means that nobody makes an application?"
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2988.088,2991.715,"Well, have any applied or not?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2995.486,2998.08,"Alright, then the Black Muslim -- I think the Black Muslim Schools would do for that."
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2998.08,2999.691,"You are wrong, as of today."
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,2999.691,3001.202,Not as of a month ago.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.202,3002.791,"Well as of today, you are wrong."
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3002.791,3006.228,"As of today, they now have one white member I believe."
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.228,3006.897,"Well, they did."
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3006.897,3009.175,"The Black Muslim Movement, but they do have schools and those --"
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3009.175,3011.191,Is that a Church School?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3011.191,3011.618,hmm?
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.618,3013.013,Is that a Church School?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3013.013,3014.043,I do not know.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3014.407,3015.489,"Well, what are you talking about?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3022.071,3024.275,You mean non-religious?
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3024.275,3031.917,"Non-religious, private school that excludes anybody on the grounds of race?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3031.917,3034.879,I do not really know that I can.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.28,3055.183,Can you imagine a white student applying to an all-Negro School in Mississippi?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3055.183,3058.576,I can imagine that Your Honor because they do seem to attend.
1975.75-62,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.678,3079.882,All I am objecting to you sir is comparing your school with the average Negro private school; there is no comparison?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3079.882,3081.042,I believe there is.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3081.042,3088.14,"Mr. Leonard, do you rely on your argument on the religion either of the two Religion Clauses of the First Amendment?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3088.14,3106.337,"The second point I wanted to come to if I may, if I find the time Your Honor is that the decisions in this country, and I may say frankly of this Court, have divided discrimination into malign and benign."
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3147.659,3148.64,I still am not sure.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3151.498,3152.245,I am sorry.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.245,3157.651,Do you rely in your argument on the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3157.651,3158.778,"Well, I do not."
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.778,3161.249,Do not?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3165.522,3166.2,We do not.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.2,3167.111,That is what I asked.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3167.714,3171.126,The Bob Jones University situation which you had before you –-
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3171.126,3171.862,Was different.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3171.862,3178.284,And the Dave Christian situations are the ones where the exclusion of other colors has done for religious grounds.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3178.284,3180.076,"Right, but that is no part of your argument?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3180.076,3181.748,That is no part of my argument.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.748,3181.884,Thank you.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3181.884,3186.224,The question is whether just the parent has the right any way.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3233.598,3236.813,Did you mean they are integrated in a religious sense?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3236.813,3245.535,I do not believe that a practicing Roman Catholic would make a good Jewish rabbi and there are schools for both.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3245.535,3249.836,So they are segregated religious schools and not integrated religiously.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3249.836,3253.351,"Religiously, they are very definitely segregated."
1975.75-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.107,3316.802,What Page of the Appendix is that on Mr. Leonard.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3316.802,3338.127,Page 168 of the Appendix.
1975.75-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.988,3415.167,Your opponents were rely here at all on state action in effect saying --
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3415.167,3426.951,"None whatever as far as I know, it was never raised as a question below, and as far as I know even the tax exemption have been taken away from these particular schools."
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.565,3515.767,Mr. Leonard.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3523.186,3524.341,Right.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3524.341,3525.786,-- prohibits the policies –-
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3525.786,3526.129,Correct.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.129,3527.529,-- that your schools follow?
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3534.203,3535.062,Those are the only two issues?
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3535.062,3535.955,Yes.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3535.955,3536.936,But you see 19 –-
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3536.936,3538.229,It is not a question of philosophy or policy or --
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3538.229,3540.707,"No, it is not."
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3540.707,3542.785,"Well, that is a matter of statutory construction, is it not?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3542.785,3543.761,Precisely.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.761,3550.05,"And if you construe it a certain way, then it is a matter of the constitutionality of the statute as applied, is it not?"
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3550.05,3551.413,We have two questions really.
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.068,3556.238,Right.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3556.238,3560.429,"Second, the First Amendment to the Constitution which 1981 cannot override."
1975.75-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3560.429,3561.815,Right.
1975.75-62,2,25614,geo_s_leonard,,3562.714,3569.729,"So that if the right exist under either to have these schools -- Sorry, my time is up."
1975.75-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.72,3575.165,Thank you Mr. Leonard.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3581.292,3585.261,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3760.096,3775.545,"Do you not think that –- Mr. Brown, do you not think there might be some significance to the difference in the introductory language between 1981 and 1982, one saying, all persons within the jurisdiction in the United States as 1981 does and 1982 starting with different language?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3775.545,3799.567,The different language in 1982 -- The language which exists in 1981 was added in 1870 Your Honor as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1870 which designed to encompass within the protection of 1981 non-citizens or aliens.
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3799.567,3801.586,Senator Stewart --
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3801.586,3802.128,I beg your pardon?
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3802.128,3806.406,I said Senator Stewart of Nevada was the one who introduced this.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3806.406,3811.073,I am not certain about that Your Honor but that I think it is you are referring to with respect of different introductory line --
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3811.073,3820.24,And was he not thrusting basically at a Fourteenth Amendment type of right rather a Thirteenth amendment?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3820.24,3830.014,"Well, Your Honor, if you are suggesting that -- if I understand you, you are suggesting that 1981 requires state action --"
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3830.014,3843.408,"Well, I am suggesting that that would be on a clean slate that might be a very logical inference where you would not get that sort of inference from 1982 based as it was held of in Jones on the Thirteenth Amendment?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3843.408,3855.268,"Well, one yard of a clean slate because there are several decisions which we are building on; and secondly, this Court has examined that legislative history."
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3880.158,3885.33,Was it ever reenacted in the revised statutes?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3885.33,3886.513,I am not sure that I understand your question.
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.513,3909.003,"Well, Section 18 of the 1870 Act was never reenacted in the revised statutes was it?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3909.003,3911.099,I am not sure if I can answer that Your Honor.
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3911.867,3919.585,And in what provision of the 1870 Act was the 1866 Act reenacted?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3919.585,3929.153,The 1981 was reenacted in Section 16 of the 1870 Act in a verbatim form and then the Section 18 --
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3929.153,3931.471,"Well, what is verbatim?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3931.471,3933.258,"Well, with slight modifications because --"
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3933.258,3936.917,"Well, it was not reenacted in verbatim form."
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3941.649,3943.452,"Oh yes! In Section 18, yes."
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3943.452,3943.792,Alright.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3949.028,3950.669,I am not sure if I can answer that Your Honor.
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3951.837,3960.697,"Well, were the revised statutes, when they wee adapted, were they the law of the land of the statutory law of the land or were there some other statutes?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3960.697,3967.738,"Well, I think the rule; the general construction to this approach that this Court has taken is that you look behind the revised statutes to do the original enactment."
1975.75-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3967.738,3982.136,Not to the revised statute of 1875 because they contain a particular provision that they are the law and they supersede the one as a Repealer Section and repeals all other law?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3982.136,3994.819,"Well, I cannot respond to this Your Honor, I am not certain to this. I did not anticipate this line of questioning because I thought the issue had been well settled by the opinions in the Tillman and Johnson versus Railway Express case."
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3994.819,3997.357,It has been settled; the question is whether it was well-settled?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,3997.357,4001.668,Oh![Laughter]
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4001.668,4005.255,There was a lot of thought that it has been well-settled before Jones against Meyer.
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4005.255,4006.981,"Well, it involved 1982."
1975.75-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4006.981,4012.99,"Well, similar -- it is a very similar question."
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4012.99,4016.978,"Yes Your Honor, I realize that."
1975.75-62,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4348.779,4352.858,Mr. Brown you answer a hypothetical question referring to school.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4390.513,4395.55,"Well, 1981 has been applied to cover --"
1975.75-62,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4395.55,4399.644,I am assuming you have an application of some person who does not fit that category and that --
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4399.644,4406.153,"If you just said Spanish-speaking, I would not think that 1981 proscribed it."
1975.75-62,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4472.951,4480.849,But then assume further that the claim is made that in operative effect this excluded over racial groups.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4480.849,4491.618,"Well, it is seems to me that it will be arguable but then it became within the proscription of 1981."
1975.75-62,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4491.618,4492.544,Mr. Brown.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4492.544,4493.361,Yes sir.
1975.75-62,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4493.361,4513.994,"In light of your comment that you have construe 1981 as applying only to racial discrimination, does that suggest that you disagree with counsel for petitioner who stated here 15-20 minutes ago that if you prevail, the principle would apply to all girls’ schools and all boys’ schools?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4513.994,4522.557,"No sir, not on the question we are talking about here, the question of construction of this statute."
1975.75-62,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4545.2,4550.814,In your view of 1981 does not embrace whites or the rights of whites?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4550.814,4551.438,I do not know that.
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4552.255,4569.19,"But that was argued last week -- but in any event it is your -- as I understand it -- it is your submission and your understanding that you are parting to us that whoever may be the permissible plaintiff under the Section 1981, the only cause of action that can be stated under 1981 is one of racial discrimination?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4569.19,4571.421,"Yes sir, no question about that in my view."
1975.75-62,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4571.421,4582.539,"So it would not apply in your view to all boys’ school and all girls’ school, so that the opposite sex would have a contractual right to enter?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4582.539,4584.315,I do not believe so Your Honor.
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4595.246,4605.768,"Do you know of any case, anywhere that has construed Section 1981 to be applicable in anything except to racial discrimination?"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4605.768,4609.926,"No, I do not know of any case."
1975.75-62,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4626.374,4631.015,"Well, that would be more broadly applicable than just to Negroes?"
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4631.015,4632.743,Oh yes.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4632.743,4633.97,I beg your pardon sir?
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4633.97,4637.422,It has not been limited just to Negroes?
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4637.422,4638.205,1981?
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4638.205,4641.608,"Yes, it has been held to applicable to --"
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4641.608,4642.367,Blacks and –-
1975.75-62,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4642.367,4644.056,-- the people of Spanish ancestry.
1975.75-62,3,17354,brown,,4644.056,4644.554,Yes.
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,5838.497,5841.041,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5991.334,5994.21,I would be interested in your bad faith point.
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,5994.21,5994.886,Excuse me Your Honor?
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5994.886,5998.0,I had difficulty in finding a bad faith point.
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,5998.0,6002.848,I would like to turn now specifically to the question of bad faith in this case.
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6076.653,6078.52,Well that is witnesses?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6078.52,6079.382,That is witnesses but it is also --
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6079.382,6083.226,"Well, what about the bad faith of the parties?"
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6083.226,6095.949,"The parties I think in this instances mark the same, three individuals involved where the directors, in fact, constitute the administration entirely at the school."
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6115.335,6120.457,But basically there was certain a constitutional right?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6120.457,6124.734,"No, we would disagree with that Your Honor, there certainly is --"
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6124.734,6127.027,But did they assert a First Amendment right?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6127.027,6127.771,They asserted a constitutional --
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6127.771,6129.619,They suppose to remember the constitutional right.
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6129.619,6130.106,Absolutely.
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6130.106,6131.957,Then they did assert a constitutional right?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6131.957,6133.691,They did assert a constitutional right.
1975.75-62,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6133.691,6138.714,"And it is pretty hard to find any bad faith when you are asserting a constitutional right, is it not?"
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6138.714,6142.983,We do not submit that there is any bad faith in their assertion of a constitutional right.
1975.75-62,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6170.56,6175.42,"About two other Federal Courts have already passed on this issue, have they not?"
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6175.42,6177.473,"I do not believe you could take two, Your Honor."
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6270.132,6281.694,"Well, at least three of the seven members of the Court of Appeals indicated that they were far from convinced that the District Court was right and its finding was a fact."
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6293.392,6302.403,"Well, I think if this Court is not convinced the way we are, Mr. Justice Stewart that the appropriate courts would be to send this case back to the Trial Court."
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6331.359,6334.858,Alyeska was decided after the Court of Appeals decision.
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6334.858,6336.116,"Oh yes, it was decided at the initial Court of Appeals."
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6336.116,6337.417,How long?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6337.417,6338.984,Almost simultaneously.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6338.984,6340.993,Was there a petition for rehearing of any kind --
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6340.993,6341.862,There was petition for rehearing.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6341.862,6344.758,-- in the Court of Appeals based on Alyeska?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6344.758,6346.756,I am not sure it was based on Alyeska.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6396.364,6401.296,"Court vindicated far from being withdrawn prior to trial, it is still been asserted here?"
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6401.296,6402.143,That is right.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6631.692,6638.384,"But neither is 1983, well, it might have been that case had involved personal injuries."
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6643.084,6644.521,"No, we absolutely agree with that Your Honor."
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6646.4,6650.506,Physical injuries are only part of that cause of action?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6650.506,6661.22,Precisely that is exactly the reason why we think neither 1981 nor 1982 nor 1983 action should be equated for purposes of analogy with the physical personal injury.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6757.745,6760.741,"This goes just to the damages in just in one of the cases, is that not correct?"
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6760.741,6761.17,That is right.
1975.75-62,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6781.413,6783.615,And there is just one of the cases?
1975.75-62,4,38673,roderic_v_o_boggs,,6783.615,6784.64,That is right.
1975.75-62,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6793.323,6794.194,Thank you gentleman.
