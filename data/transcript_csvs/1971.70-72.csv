1971.70-72,1,33477,john_e_f_wood,,2739.094,2767.77,"Well, I have really just as briefly as I can adequately on the Parke-Davis aspect that I should like to turn to another part of the charge as to which the Court of Appeals concluded that evidence favorable to the defense was seriously undermined by the charge and that had to do with testimony by the principal officers of the defendants."
