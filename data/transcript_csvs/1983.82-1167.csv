1983.82-1167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.388,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Jacobsen.
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,69.125,73.259,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,146.276,148.788,"Well, they didn't... they didn't open the plastic bag."
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,148.788,150.55,"--They did not open the plastic bag, that's right."
1983.82-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.55,166.569,"Would the existence of the bag in that condition amount to, in your view, immediately apparent incriminating material to authorize a plain view seizure?"
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,166.569,170.723,I think it's absolutely clear that at that point probable cause existed.
1983.82-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.723,171.362,Why?
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,171.362,172.103,That's right.
1983.82-1167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.635,179.99,"Any white powder package like that, there's probable cause to believe that it's contraband?"
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,179.99,180.428,--Yes.
1983.82-1167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,214.031,231.682,"Do you think the knowledge they had acquired at that time before the testing, just the observation, would have been sufficient to support the issuance of a warrant to search the house after they made the controlled delivery?"
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,231.682,236.405,"Yes, I think that's right, because there existed probable cause to--"
1983.82-1167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.405,238.498,I was asking the question.
1983.82-1167,0,21595,david_s_strauss,,241.169,241.649,--Yes.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1310.682,1313.965,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.546,1381.561,"Do you concede... do you concede, Mr. Peterson, that had the information that's described in this record been presented to a magistrate before they did the testing, a warrant would properly issue for the opening of the bag and the testing of the contents?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1381.561,1385.041,"--No, I do not concede that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1416.904,1435.487,"Well, do you think a warrant could have been issued without the testing, a warrant issued for the search of the house after they made a controlled delivery, on the information that is now available?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1435.487,1445.011,If we assume that the narcotics agents viewed the same thing that the Federal Express people did and put in--
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.011,1446.872,"That's... that's... that's in... that's this record, isn't it?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1446.872,1452.368,"--They did view the same thing, but the... I simply can't recall what was in the affidavit."
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.049,1484.248,"You think we... you think we... as the case comes here there... there's been a holding that there was no probable cause prior to the testing, and that's the way we should judge the case?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1484.248,1485.187,"--That's... that's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.187,1493.134,And the only way the Government then can win the case is by our holding that the... that the testing is not a search at all subject to the Fourth Amendment.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1493.134,1495.325,That is my view of this case.
1983.82-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.325,1497.685,This isn't quite fair to the Eighth Circuit.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1513.927,1515.116,"I'm sorry, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.618,1525.384,"Well, what about... but your position is that... that there was no probable cause just from looking at this white powder in plastic bags."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1525.384,1526.085,No.
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.497,1547.237,"Well, then, you... you think they could have gotten a warrant then."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1552.482,1561.977,"--In all likelihood, they could have gotten a warrant if they had seized it, presented the facts known to them at the time to a United States magistrate."
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.183,1570.535,"Well, then, you... a valid warrant."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1570.535,1572.245,--Correct.
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.032,1661.263,Which of the prevailing opinions in Walther do you suggest that we follow?
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1661.263,1670.379,"Well, I'm suggesting that you follow Justice Stevens' opinion."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.119,1752.292,"Well, if they'd sent it in a better package, perhaps it wouldn't have broken open."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1752.292,1771.487,"That perhaps is correct, but I believe there is some evidence in the record... and I confess I can't recall if it's in the Joint Appendix... that the damaged package was due to the actions of Federal Express because it was punctured with a forklift or something like that."
1983.82-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.783,1844.533,"Then how do you respond to your opponent's argument based on Burdeau against McDowell that this stack of papers were turned over to the... to the Government, and they don't really know the extent to which the private party might have read all those papers?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1844.533,1854.339,"Well, the... the simplistic response to your question, Justice Stevens, is that they should call the private party and find out."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.372,1911.556,"In this case you say it's your position, I gather, Mr. Peterson, that the Government could search to the same extent that the FEA people had searched; so that would have left them at the most extreme point of the FEA's... looking at a clear plastic bag with powder inside."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1917.881,1918.391,Yes.
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.201,1945.768,"So you think that although they had probable cause, since they did not have a warrant, the... the seizure fails because that is the kind of seizure for which a warrant is required?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1945.768,1946.368,No.
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.967,1983.014,"So they... they could seize it under probable cause, but they couldn't further penetrate its nature, whatever you want to call it, its molecular structure without getting a warrant."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1983.014,1984.282,That is our position.
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.282,1988.286,"Well, I think a separate point is they couldn't open the package either."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1988.286,1998.524,The... and I'm going to get hung up in words here... they could open the... the big package itself--
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.524,2000.765,"Well, I know, but could they open the plastic bag?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2000.765,2008.69,--It's... it's my position that they should not have opened the plastic bags themselves because they had not been previously opened.
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.744,2027.803,But you would still be here even if the bag... if one of the plastic bags had been opened and the... they still couldn't have done anything but seize and then get a warrant to do the test.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2027.803,2031.045,"That is my submission, Justice White."
1983.82-1167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.045,2036.788,Could they have applied for a warrant at that stage without opening the bag?
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2036.788,2042.572,"Based upon the information that they had from Federal Express, based upon the appearance of the container--"
1983.82-1167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.572,2044.443,The appearance of the container.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2044.443,2045.895,--They certainly could have.
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.166,2052.037,They would have gotten it.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2084.2,2097.829,"That is a question, Justice Rehnquist, which I think would probably be answered based upon this Court's decisions in New York v. Belton and United States v. Robinson."
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.06,2160.249,"Well, Mr. Peterson, suppose... suppose the Government has an informant... has an undercover agent and he goes around and buys... and is... and buys some drugs off of a pusher."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2198.875,2205.678,"Well, if Mr. Peterson were present, he would tell the pusher that you weren't listening to what I was saying, because--"
1983.82-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.417,2240.87,And I suppose the same rationale vaguely could apply to incident to arrest.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2240.87,2268.169,"It does because there... and the other examples of field tests or chemical tests of contraband, which Justice Rehnquist referred to, and several of which I did set forth in my brief, there is a prior Fourth Amendment justification for the search which is involved, whether it be a valid search warrant, a hand-to-hand buy or what have you."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.294,2389.739,But you said there was probable cause to seize the package because of a belief that it had contraband.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2399.907,2407.941,"--There may be very little privacy interest left, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.929,2430.206,"Well, but in... in that case it might well be that there wouldn't be probable cause to seize the package or the papers because it wouldn't be at all evident that they were contraband."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2442.703,2458.804,"--Well, it was my understanding that the Government stated every time you see white powder in plastic baggies, that's probable cause to believe it's contraband."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.735,2465.199,But they didn't say every time you see papers in a plastic sack it's cause to believe it's contraband.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2465.199,2488.064,"--The only point I was making is that if you... if you assume that the presence of such a plastic baggie in a package provides probable cause to seize that package, then whatever else is in there, if it is anything else, apparently you don't have an expectation of privacy in that either."
1983.82-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.064,2499.069,"I didn't think the Government's submission was based just on the fact it was a baggie, but that you could see a white powder in a baggie, and that the combination was what gave you probable cause."
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2499.069,2505.704,"Well, maybe that is the case."
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2536.886,2537.506,Let me put--
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2537.506,2538.436,Excuse me.
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.436,2540.539,--Let me put this hypothetical to you.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2596.595,2606.72,"Well, it might be a search which is valid under the border search exception if it were going to--"
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.72,2608.763,This isn't incoming; this is outgoing.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2613.916,2615.045,--Okay.
1983.82-1167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.14,2682.792,But dog sniffing is no intrusion.
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2687.965,2690.676,"--That's correct, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.383,2901.014,"Mr. Peterson, may I interrupt you?"
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2914.512,2920.396,--And the agents just dumped the powder out to test it?
1983.82-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.396,2928.223,Just took a little bit out of what was... which they could get to without having to... do you rely at all on the ripping... on the puncturing?
1983.82-1167,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2930.985,2937.7,"I guess my case might be a little bit more difficult, but I don't think it would be crucial had it happened that way."
1983.82-1167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.513,3039.084,Very well.
1983.82-1167,2,21595,david_s_strauss,,3041.305,3045.108,"Mr. Chief Justice, just two points of clarification."
1983.82-1167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3119.209,3121.49,"Thank you, gentlemen."
