2010.09-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case No. 09-587, Harrington v. Richter."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,11.139,13.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.49,68.06,How do -- how do we know that the -- the California Court even reached that question?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,78.682,87.538,--There was a procedural bar that was argued in the informal opposition in the petition for writ of habeas corpus that had been requested by the California Supreme Court.
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.592,95.544,Of course it said -- it just said denied on -- on the merits.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,100.243,100.995,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,100.995,113.386,"It's still not clear to me how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we say when there's a one-line order, as in this case, where it says simply ""denied"", that it is presumptively on the merits?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,115.003,115.436,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.879,134.629,Then it is presumptively on the merits?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,134.629,135.179,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.179,137.431,"Then don't -- I mean, is that the way it's stated?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,141.133,150.405,"The State's formulation is that the silent or so-called summary denial is on the merits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in--"
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.405,152.105,"Now, that can't be a Ninth Circuit rule."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,163.962,164.612,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,166.831,167.866,But did--
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.866,183.46,"But if I am on the California court and I have two choices -- one is to say denied, no explanation, this case; the other is to say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options, then why are they both on the merits?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,183.46,197.22,"--Again, because it has certainly been well-understood for at least 3-and-a-half decades that when the California Supreme Court renders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the merits unless the court ordered--"
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.22,203.123,And what is the leading California authority on that proposition?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,203.123,204.989,"--That would be In re Robbins, in which--"
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.989,205.873,That's the Robbins case.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,206.325,209.11,"--which is discussed in our brief, as well as in the reply brief."
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.11,209.56,All right.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.927,214.229,"Counsel, I don't know that you answered Justice Kennedy's question."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,214.229,215.014,I'm sorry?
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,215.014,216.931,I don't know you answered his question.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,224.935,226.47,There really is no substantive--
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,226.47,229.155,"And there's two choices, so they have to have different meanings in some way."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,229.155,237.595,--I would submit that there is no substantive distinction between an order that simply reflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the merits.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,237.595,240.111,They showed us the docket for that day--
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,240.111,240.944,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,240.944,244.896,"--of the denial here, and there were different ones."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,253.169,261.857,"Well, I would submit that there could be any number of reasons, and not the least of which this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold, just a couple of terms ago."
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.758,296.364,"Well, that's what -- that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether it's procedural or merits."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,300.15,300.766,No.
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.146,348.379,"--Well, what would the California Supreme Court do if they all agreed that this application should be denied, but two of them think it's for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others think it has no merit, and they say just ""denied"", but there is no majority for either one?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,348.379,360.937,"--In -- in that instance, then the claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's order simply reflects ""petition denied"", again, it is well understood that that would be a denial on the merits--"
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.937,362.437,"Even though, in fact, it wasn't?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,362.437,364.055,"--Well, we can't know that."
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.024,375.611,"So there is that possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we should assume it was on the merits."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,402.261,411.2,"--Well, I would respectfully disagree with that suggestion, that because it simply says ""denied"" without including the phrase ""on the merits"" that it's not a merits determination."
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.2,414.236,"But that's what they would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,414.236,414.752,I'm sorry.
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.102,417.535,"If, in fact, the court was divided."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,432.028,446.887,"Yes, if it's -- if it's a straight silent denial and the -- the court doesn't invoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forego the procedural bar and find the claims are substantive meritless in any event."
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.996,489.816,Do -- does the court sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,489.816,490.366,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.682,528.405,"So you are saying that if it's on both grounds, if they agreed with both the procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -- just deny without any explanation?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,534.059,534.559,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.559,535.595,All right.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.595,546.117,"If you looked back at a sample of the cases in which they have simply said ""denied"", would we find cases in which no procedural bar was raised by the State?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,546.117,562.495,"I don't know the answer to that question, because I haven't researched to find out whether or not in any of those cases, like in this case, the California Supreme Court directed the Attorney General to file an informal opposition or some other pleading that would have addressed that question."
2010.09-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.034,576.652,Was there a procedural issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,576.652,577.419,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.419,578.169,What was that?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,578.169,581.288,"A timeliness bar, among others."
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,581.288,582.64,What was the basis of that?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,582.64,604.737,"That the claim of ineffective assistance could and should have been discovered at an earlier time than when it was presented to the California Supreme Court under California's timeliness rule, which would require that counsel present the claim of, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning of the factual basis to support such a claim."
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.737,609.457,So it took 14 months for this petition to be filed to the State court.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,616.361,616.877,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.181,627.049,"So there is great validity, you think, to your timeliness, so this timeliness claim."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,631.767,652.763,"--Yes, because I would submit that when the State argued that the claim was procedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the State court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it necessarily concluded that the claims were unmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been barred by a procedural bar, but they--"
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.763,664.754,"I thought you just told me that if they -- if they agreed both on the procedural ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -- just a denial without explanation."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,664.754,665.888,--That's--
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.888,668.273,Now you are telling me that -- the opposite.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,668.273,670.892,"--If I said that, then I misspoke."
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.514,684.05,It will always be in the order.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,684.05,684.7,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.7,689.437,"But in this case, they didn't reject it on a procedural ground."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,697.856,703.594,"That's correct, assuming that the Federal courts agreed that the--"
2010.09-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.594,713.783,"If in fact the -- they are right, if in fact the State was correct that this was procedurally barred, they should have raised it earlier."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,724.758,725.358,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.858,739.45,"So normally, to decide a matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that they are reciting it substantively rather than procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this case."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,739.45,740.583,That's correct.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,740.583,744.735,But you didn't raise -- you haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,744.735,746.568,"Not in the Federal court, no."
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,746.568,747.418,So you may have waived that.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,758.876,760.542,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,761.626,763.161,So everything might be waived here.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,763.161,771.184,"--Well, I'm not sure that -- we never invoked the procedural bar in the Federal court insofar as the presentation of these particular claims."
2010.09-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.184,777.754,"One thing that's not waived is the second question of the first, which is the merits of the Strickland claim."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,777.754,778.17,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,778.17,779.837,Maybe this would be a good point for you to switch to that.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,779.837,783.222,I would be pleased to discuss that with the Court.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,797.216,797.932,Did they say that?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,797.932,798.75,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.75,802.869,Did they explicitly say in every single case you have to consult an expert?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,802.869,804.169,No.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,805.002,815.458,"Or did they say the circumstances of this case, given the nature of the issues, that consultation would have been effective?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,815.458,820.362,That is -- that certainly is one reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,844.81,864.64,"We could take issue with the timing of that consultation, but let's assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had consulted an expert, that that expert would have told him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be Klein's near the bedroom."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,872.96,875.162,"--No, I would disagree with that."
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.162,886.304,"You would say, even if the expert were to -- an expert would have given that kind of exculpatory information, that that would not have been ineffective?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,886.304,898.945,"Let me start by saying this: First of all, we can't know and no one can ever know that Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was in this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit--"
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,898.945,903.164,I'm not talking -- I gave you a hypothetical different from the facts of this case.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,945.157,945.693,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,953.929,968.689,"You keep wanting to return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, the Ninth Circuit's point."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,968.689,969.458,--In response to your--
2010.09-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.458,973.826,It may well be in this case that the consultation would have resulted in no prejudice.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,983.049,995.525,"--I suppose accepting the Court's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware of and failed to consult with an expert knowing that that testimony would be presented, could be deemed deficient performance."
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.525,1001.845,Why -- do you think it makes a difference whether the expert would have helped or not?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1025.858,1034.512,"Yes, and I think it's important to look at -- as this Court has described in the Strickland case itself, we have to view from counsel's perspective at that time."
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.8,1054.192,Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical would include the situation where he doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce any expert testimony.
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1076.205,1089.163,"--No, I would submit that it certainly could be deficient performance if counsel fails to investigate readily available evidence that could lead to exculpatory evidence in support of his client's defense."
2010.09-587,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.833,1094.35,"Well, could?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1099.901,1105.489,"Again, I think it would be -- it's going to be fact-specific depending upon the kind of case."
2010.09-587,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1134.489,1151.951,"But isn't it the reality that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are adverse for him and it's better for the defense counsel to leave things murky and argue to the jury that the State didn't produce the evidence, either?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1154.886,1155.503,It is.
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1165.111,1187.29,"Mr. Colombo, you -- you say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even assuming there was, there was -- there would be no prejudice in this case?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1187.29,1187.574,That's correct.
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.007,1194.494,And could you just summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1194.494,1219.776,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the expert declarations that were proffered by Respondent in support of his habeas petition really don't challenge the testimony that was presented in the State trial by the State's experts, specifically the question of whether or not the murder victim could have been moved from, supposedly, the area outside the bedroom door onto the couch."
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1232.666,1235.618,What about the -- the pool of blood?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1246.724,1261.749,"I think the actual expert declaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as the expert described it, could be eliminated, because Johnson could not have bled into the blood pool sufficient to have formed it by merely standing and waiting for the police to arrive."
2010.09-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1332.743,1344.987,"On the -- on the no prejudice issue, are you relying just on what happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1361.413,1362.346,--Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1462.528,1465.73,Was there additional physical evidence found not at the scene?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1465.73,1466.88,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.253,1505.371,Could I ask you a question about California procedure?
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1518.013,1518.463,Yes.
2010.09-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1529.903,1535.14,"And if the defendant requests that, what is the defendant's reciprocal obligation, if any?"
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1535.14,1545.33,"The defendant would have to disclose any witnesses that he or she intends to introduce at trial, including expert testimony and any reports supporting such expert."
2010.09-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.632,1549.567,"Thank you, Mr. Colombo."
2010.09-587,0,26690,harry_j_colombo,,1549.567,1550.134,Thank you.
2010.09-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.134,1557.971,Mr. Gardner.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1557.971,1560.256,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1617.156,1621.56,I thought that the point was that there was no trail from the bed.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1650.979,1651.462,--Indeed.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.163,1681.865,So -- so the idea is that Johnson drags Klein.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1686.133,1688.333,"--Yes, I think he could have lifted him, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.333,1689.085,Really?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1690.501,1690.885,No.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.885,1695.505,Did you get expert testimony about that or an expert report about that?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1695.505,1695.755,No.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1699.623,1702.473,But you think you can assume he could lift the weight.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1703.491,1706.527,I think he weighed between 150 and 160 pounds.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.527,1707.66,And Johnson?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1707.66,1709.062,"I think about the same, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.062,1709.562,Okay.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1716.216,1724.369,"I'm saying that -- that the testimony, and the suggestion that there was no trail of blood between the blood pool and the couch, is not consistent with what Detective Bell testified to."
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.369,1724.535,Mr.--
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1724.535,1731.689,And what is your theory about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go through this exertion?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1752.817,1759.737,"Well, if he -- if he falls in the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a crossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable."
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1773.73,1785.472,"But he could have -- if he's going to make up a story, he could have made up a story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without having engaged in any firing himself and he fell wherever he fell."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1807.451,1814.188,"Well, I can only say that if Klein is caught in a crossfire, then Johnson is culpable."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.461,1821.644,Why wouldn't he wipe up the blood?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1829.816,1834.868,"--I don't doubt that in retrospect he could have come up with a better plan, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.64,1846.49,What -- what other--
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.49,1858.281,"--Counsel, there is a lot of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited or talks about how that pool was formed."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,1917.134,1921.169,"Let's take both the high-velocity blood splattering and the pooling, Your Honor, but let me start with the predicate."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.762,2020.951,"Counsel, what other expert evidence should Richter's counsel should have pursued before deciding upon this course of action in this case?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2026.136,2035.544,"Putting aside the blood splatter issue -- and these were raised in the lower court but not addressed -- he promised ballistics testimony as well, which he didn't produce."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.544,2035.794,Okay.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2056.707,2062.194,"Well, I think the chief reason is that that wasn't part of his theory, if you look."
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2079.804,2089.595,"Well, he had not received any notice from the State that they were going to call any experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume they are not going to call any experts?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2102.835,2109.239,"Well, if this case were about anticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I would agree, but it's not."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.011,2128.319,"I thought the Ninth Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the State's expert in the middle of trial."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2128.319,2129.269,"I agree, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.549,2153.334,Could you explain the blood pooling in the face for me?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2155.351,2155.87,"--Yes, I did."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2208.403,2211.438,Do I understand you -- I just want to step back to your prior answer.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2219.461,2222.579,If -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.583,2282.813,"Mr. Gardner, what about the argument that all this is beside the point because the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2282.813,2289.384,"Well, it will come as no surprise to know that I disagree with that argument, Your Honor, and for a couple of reasons."
2010.09-587,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.218,2323.471,"Well, of course, Johnson had given so many inconsistent statements at the outset that he was a weak prosecution witness."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2328.192,2336.279,"Well, I think -- actually, I agree with the predicate of the question, Your Honor, and that is: Johnson had given a number of stories."
2010.09-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.994,2387.509,"What do you do with the ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun safe is found there and the unlikely story about them going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and then coming back."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2387.509,2391.163,"Well, let me take them one at a time, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2459.52,2477.064,"You mean the case against Gunner you've just described, would it have been enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's decision to focus on credibility rather than expert physical evidence?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2477.064,2478.166,I think not.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.783,2541.151,Did -- did the counsel have to investigate the other aspects?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2567.718,2568.385,--I don't believe so.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.802,2608.176,"What does -- what happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2624.369,2643.147,"Well, in a situation where -- where counsel's investigation will not be exposed to the prosecutor, and -- and there was questions before about how California procedure works and indeed once you decide to name -- to call a witness, you name him and he becomes, you know, exposed to cross-examination and for investigation."
2010.09-587,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.372,2665.846,"But if -- if the expert says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could not argue otherwise to the jury?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2665.846,2668.346,I think ethically you couldn't argue otherwise to the jury.
2010.09-587,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.346,2668.729,All right.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2685.924,2693.677,"I -- I don't disagree, except that again we come back to the -- the notion from Wiggins, which is you can't defend a tactical judgment that wasn't made."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.649,2719.561,"--Can I come back to your response to the Chief Justice's about counsel that knows that his client is guilty, and you say the ABA standards say that even when that's the case, you have an obligation to get an expert witness to confirm that the client is--"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2719.561,2724.946,"--I'm sorry, I thought -- I thought the hypothetical was that counsel's client said he was guilty, not that counsel thought he was guilty."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.946,2725.465,--Right.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2725.465,2732.202,"The ABA standards say that the duty to investigate, the broad duty to investigate of defense counsel exists, irrespective of the client's statements to its lawyer."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.202,2734.485,"We've never adopted the ABA standards, have we?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2734.485,2735.651,"In that regard, no, you haven't."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.651,2737.118,That standard seems to me quite silly.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2737.853,2746.459,"I -- I -- you know, I can understand that, Your Honor, but from practical experience, I will tell you the fact that a client admits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did it."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.879,2758.617,"Well, I'm sure they often say they are innocent when they are guilty."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2762.652,2770.988,"Well, you know, I would suggestion the false confession literature has come out, and there is plenty of it to show that, in fact, that's not an infrequent occurrence."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.988,2775.209,"To -- to the police, perhaps, yes, but to his own counsel?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2778.511,2783.113,"In which case I will come back to the answer that the Chief Justice suggested a few moments ago, that that's not my case."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.415,2788.081,"Counsel, your case -- your case does have an AEDPA issue."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2788.867,2789.283,It does.
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.283,2790.033,--to that now.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2790.033,2791.569,"I was trying to use that as a segue into that, Your Honor."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.052,2792.819,It worked.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2792.819,2793.652,It worked.
2010.09-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.742,2841.233,"What is your answer to the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins settled that when the California Supreme Court says just denied, it's on the merits?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2841.233,2842.668,"Well, actually I agree and disagree."
2010.09-587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.641,2883.692,"But what they cite it for, actually, they make a slightly different argument in their brief."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,2949.451,2954.17,"--Well, there's a whole bunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it out."
2010.09-587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.175,3000.947,"For example, in Hunter v. Aispuro they quote it as saying the following, the California Supreme Court's denial of a State habeas petition"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3046.576,3047.042,Yes.
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3090.069,3117.486,"I'm having a very hard time with your reliance on that footnote because the very last paragraph of that footnote says when Respondent's asserts, and I'm shortening the introductory line, a State procedural bar and when nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus decision does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to that claim, that signifies that we considered Respondent's assertion and have determined that the claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural ground."
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3123.123,3125.992,"--I think that's right, Your Honor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says."
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3138.364,3139.133,Right.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3139.133,3144.335,"When you put those together what it means is there was no majority for a decision on the merits, otherwise they would have said on the merits."
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.062,3162.645,Excuse me.
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3169.966,3172.434,--You say either ground.
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.921,3192.411,"Yes, but you are positing that the only time they do not say either procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't have a majority for either one?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3192.411,3193.53,That's correct.
2010.09-587,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.53,3199.934,"How can they render a decision in favor of the State, then, if there is no majority for either disposition?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3199.934,3205.136,The question is why deliberate to a majority when they sit around a conference of seven judges.
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3241.511,3249.431,"But under your example then, isn't there a majority for the proposition that there is a procedural default, but disagreement as to the particular procedural default?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3249.431,3249.95,--That could be.
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3249.95,3261.841,"Just a binary choice between procedural default and merits, isn't there -- and everybody agrees it should be denied and there is going to be a majority for one or the other, right?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3261.841,3264.641,That is true and I have been unclear and I apologize for that.
2010.09-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3280.4,3285.487,"Is there more than one possible procedural problem here, I thought it was just timeliness?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3285.487,3296.51,"Well, timeliness was the only one raised by the State, but to be sure, like this Court, the California Supreme Court has never been bound in terms of its procedural default findings by what has been raised and--"
2010.09-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3296.51,3298.878,What others could apply in this case?
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3298.878,3309.335,"--Well, at the risk of not wanting to argue against my client, I could give you some that could apply that haven't been suggested and, therefore, are most certainly are waived."
2010.09-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3333.035,3360.018,"With this confusion, your version, your colleagues version, the district court denied relief, did you ask the district court, please certify this question of what a silent denial means, certify it to California Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer of what a silent denial means?"
2010.09-587,1,18968,clifford_gardner,,3360.018,3363.154,"--The answer is no, I didn't request certification."
2010.09-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.814,3379.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3382.032,3383.301,Thank you.
2010.09-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3438.102,3456.33,"Is it fair to say that this in this case, that every party in the lower courts assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said anything about it being a procedural issue where there would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either waived or not waived?"
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3456.33,3457.099,That's correct.
2010.09-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3457.099,3460.884,The first time anybody mentioned this procedural issue was when?
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3460.884,3465.27,When Respondent's counsel filed his brief in opposition in this Court.
2010.09-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3465.27,3467.705,That was on the merits brief in opposition?
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3467.705,3468.305,That's correct.
2010.09-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3468.305,3469.84,There was nothing before that?
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3469.84,3470.357,Yes.
2010.09-587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3470.357,3474.276,"It wasn't part of the cert, the question, we added the question."
2010.09-587,2,26690,harry_j_colombo,,3474.276,3486.166,"Well, I would submit that if there was a dispute about the applicability of the deference to the California Supreme Court, it should have been raised much earlier than when we got to this Court."
