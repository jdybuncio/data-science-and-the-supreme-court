1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,154.634,155.879,And the Court of Appeals is wrong.

1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,784.095,784.403,Certainly sir.
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,784.403,788.801,I don't think I can see a pink line from here.
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,788.801,800.876,It starts right here going over here and then to this.
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.876,802.356,"Obviously, I cannot see it."
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,803.826,809.522,I don't know if that helps but I hope it is.
1967.40,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1101.581,1102.331,Who is that?

1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.436,1322.968,"And if so, tell me."

1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1331.693,1332.094,That's right.
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.094,1332.943,(Inaudible) not the --
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1332.943,1333.157,But --
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.157,1334.153,-- concept of primary.
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1334.153,1337.48,"Well, but the term primary describes the term area."
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.491,1346.595,"But what if the areas -- the two cities then there's no question that -- what KU is the primary supplier and TVA was not, am I correct?"
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1346.595,1347.156,Yes Your Honor.
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.269,1353.408,Right.
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1353.408,1359.283,-- or whether utility islands within that pink line are excluded.

1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.018,1363.706,Is that a way of telling me that I'm right or wrong with my understanding --
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1363.706,1363.803,Well --
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.803,1365.019,-- of the issue.
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1365.019,1373.422,I think you're right Your Honor.
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.775,1809.676,"You're telling us though as I understand it, that we must give more deference to a decision which is made with no notice, no hearing, no adversary proceeding."
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1822.339,1824.327,"Yes Your Honor, we do say that --"
1967.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1824.327,1824.468,(Inaudible)
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1824.468,1847.846,"-- because we think the rule has always been that where you have an executive determination, one that is not associated with adjudication, a situation where the executive is called upon in performing its normal duties to look at the statutes under which it acts and act accordingly that you have there a question of executive discretion."
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1853.626,1863.256,"Well, why was it that -- why wasn't this something like a rulemaking by executive or administrative agency?"
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1863.256,1871.881,"Well, it certainly couldn't be rule making, Your Honor, because the Administrative Procedure Act expressly excludes anything having to do with property or contracts from rulemaking."
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1871.881,1879.925,"I didn't say it was rule making within that, I just -- I -- isn't it like rulemaking? It's really an instruction of the statute by the --"
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1879.925,1881.688,"Yes, yes, it is that."
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1881.688,1892.817,And certainly the administrative agency of the rulemaking has some kind of previous notice and enough to be heard by the public?
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1892.817,1893.714,That's correct and that's what the --
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1893.714,1893.784,(Voice Overlap) --
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1893.784,1896.102,-- Administrative Procedure Act provides for.
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.102,1899.129,"Yes, I didn't suggest the lack of -- it applies, but --"
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1899.129,1900.649,Correct.
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1900.649,1913.931,But you say except where it does apply that this sort of determination by executive agency have always been and should be practically immune judicially?
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1913.931,1915.709,Not practically immune.
1967.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1934.938,1936.5,Are you going to argue standing and --
1967.40,0,39852,robert_h_marquis,,1936.5,1938.636,"Yes, I'm about to get to that right now."
1967.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2125.391,2133.698,Very well.
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2134.906,2138.456,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2197.324,2198.229,Town of what?
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2198.229,2200.325,"New Tazewell, Tennessee."
1967.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2200.325,2202.276,What's the population?
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2202.276,2213.636,The population on incorporation 1955 was approximately 1040 in Tazewell and approximately 700 in New Tazewell.
1967.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2281.429,2283.466,What was the population today?
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2283.466,2295.925,"The populations today, Your Honor are in Tazewell, approximately 1600 and New Tazewell approximately 1200 to 1300."
1967.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.118,2557.086,(Inaudible)
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2557.086,2558.385,Yes.
1967.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.385,2559.97,That's three and a half miles away from you?
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2559.97,2561.615,"Yes, the backwaters."
1967.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2561.615,2563.422,Yes
1967.40,1,46329,william_r_stanifer,,2563.422,2579.374,Now to affirm KU's position in this case would be to deny our citizens the freedom of choice and would most certainly create an intolerable situation that we could never live with.
1967.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2594.439,2597.921,Mr. Marshall.

1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2710.877,2718.981,-- Kentucky -- how much of Kentucky Utilities power is TVA power (Voice Overlap)?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2718.981,2721.841,We do not buy power from TVA.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2721.841,2722.116,I know but --
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2722.116,2722.313,One --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2722.313,2725.653,--you exchange power as a net one way or the other.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2725.653,2726.666,There's a very little on that.

1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2743.336,2744.331,I didn't understand the first word.

1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2752.02,2752.559,No.

1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2753.523,2754.219,No.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2785.371,2785.98,I see.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2786.676,2788.675,I think I know the point of your question and --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2788.675,2789.983,That's certainly what I was trying to (Voice Overlap).
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2789.983,2791.971,Alright sir.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.512,2926.561,I would just like to aske you a question on that respect?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2934.69,2935.742,Generating plant.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.742,2950.574,-- and that that's -- and here was just a -- here was a place where they had a generating plants and supplied an area inside -- with inside the general area thereby served by TVA.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2961.191,2967.195,Does your assumption include customers KU had a generating plant and served customers at a defined area?
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.195,2968.301,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,2968.301,2970.314,We -- that is where we differ with TVA.

1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3157.145,3158.328,I think that's --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3158.328,3158.401,(Inaudible)
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3158.401,3159.746,-- exactly where I'm headed.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3159.746,3161.602,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3161.602,3166.701,"In Kentucky, just north of the Tennessee state line, Kentucky Utilities has the only service there."
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3206.82,3211.481,What area is not exactly -- make a lawful decision?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3216.008,3218.554,"Something different, if you've ever driven through this part of the mountains down there --"
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3218.554,3220.178,(Inaudible)
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3220.178,3221.676,-- it's quite a bit different.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3364.976,3373.28,"Well, don't forget about my corridor -- don't forget about my corridor question and this map is dated, am I wrong?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3376.729,3377.412,No sir.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3381.269,3385.089,"What's that date, the November 30, 1944?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3385.089,3386.944,Are you looking at Exhibit 36 sir?
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3386.944,3387.743,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3387.743,3390.347,That -- that's the time the base map was made.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3396.857,3399.904,"Well, however, it says general revision."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3406.846,3408.563,"Yes, I -- I can't."
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3408.635,3413.112,(Inaudible) revision says some date in 1945.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3413.112,3414.177,Yes sir.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3414.177,3421.403,"This was revised 1945, what evidence is there in the record that something happened later."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3421.403,3430.155,"The evidence says the letter from Mr. DeMerit, dated in 1952 in which he indicates that he used a base map."
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3446.81,3447.357,I don't know what that is.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3447.357,3449.091,Where is the letter?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3449.091,3454.563,The letter is part of the Exhibit 36.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3459.745,3467.546,"And now, tell me what this corridor means if anything which you referred to as a corridor?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3467.546,3468.676,Everyone of the --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3468.676,3471.184,"He doesn't refer to this corridor, does he?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3471.184,3475.473,"No, he refers to it as an area now served by KU."
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3476.287,3484.54,"You're telling us that when this is seen by Kentucky Utilities, all these lines are on this map."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3484.54,3488.745,Everything that's on this map except the dark shading was there.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3493.465,3503.961,And you also -- what evidence do you have that this was made up subsequent to 1945 except to this letter?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3503.961,3505.163,Nothing except to the letter.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3506.793,3520.078,"And anything in the letter would indicate when a drawing was made on the map and there's no data there -- no occasion of their revision at ‘45, is it?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3520.078,3521.01,No sir.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3521.01,3524.416,"Alright, now explain the corridor to me if you will, please."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3524.416,3527.221,I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean by explain the corridor.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3527.664,3529.314,But you're referring to this as a corridor.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3531.598,3531.79,It --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3531.79,3552.54,"Your reliance here that -- going down, scoop down a southeasterly direction on this map but that doesn't indicate -- I don't know why it's called a corridor because there's any -- no allocation of that territory to you so far as I know by law, is there?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3552.54,3560.105,"No, not by law but I will come to facts that indicate it was our recognized territory, recognized by the defendants themselves."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3647.671,3648.837,Where is that map?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3650.777,3652.449,It's (Inaudible) on Exhibit 14
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3652.449,3655.853,"You said, it represents the boundary."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3655.853,3657.974,It's Exhibit 14 sir.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3686.183,3688.404,Is that -- say what page of the --
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3688.404,3692.831,It's on this large map volume.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3755.202,3769.649,But what do -- please tell me what significance you place upon these so-called divisions of territory?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3769.649,3779.868,These divisions of territory constitutes acknowledgments by the defendants themselves that this was territory supplied by KU on the effective date of the Act --
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3779.868,3779.949,So --
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3779.949,3782.807,-- and therefore was not supplied by TVA.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3784.832,3791.87,Are you saying that the Powell Valley acknowledgements if such there were are binding on TVA?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3791.87,3799.754,"I'm not saying they're binding in a contractual sense, I'm saying they constitute evidence as to where the services were."
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3809.733,3821.523,"I thought Mr. Marquis told us that in the Tazewell and New Tazewell areas as -- power were supplied by two TVA distributors, Powell Valley and what's the other one?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3821.523,3822.842,La Follette.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3822.842,3824.996,Where -- and what about La Follette?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3828.194,3834.236,The map was drawn to show only the boundary between KU and Powell Valley.
1967.40,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3843.709,3847.928,"Well, I don't know about controversy between La Follette."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3853.064,3853.604,I think not.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3859.343,3866.166,"Well, on the date of the Act, do you say that other than that, you had up there was the showing the corridor -- with your so-called corridor."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3877.21,3878.342,This map right here?
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3878.342,3878.37,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3878.37,3879.364,Was this the map that you referred to?
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3879.364,3879.882,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3879.882,3881.587,Those are substantially the boundaries.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3884.771,3885.056,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3885.14,3887.461,So --
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3887.461,3895.818,The outer boundaries of that shaded area are -- represent the exterior limits of TVA territory on the date of the Act.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3895.884,3896.116,Yes.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.116,3898.415,"Is that your -- well, the five-mile --"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3898.415,3901.683,Are you saying the outer boundaries of this shaded --
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.683,3902.098,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3902.098,3903.96,-- TVA's facilities run to the border --
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.96,3903.97,That's right.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3903.97,3905.75,-- of that shaded area and did not come in with one exception.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3905.75,3906.697,I understand.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3914.844,3917.402,"Yes, they did not serve in that area."
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3917.402,3925.993,"Well, but it would have the authority over the Act to go ahead and serve anywhere in that shaded area except as you say in the Tazewell."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3925.993,3927.345,Except as I say what sir?
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3927.345,3928.955,Except in the Tazewell?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3928.955,3929.551,No.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3930.493,3932.981,"Well, what about the five-mile of the periphery?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3932.981,3945.089,The TVA does not claim a right to take any territory in this case by reason of the five-mile periphery provision because that says that they cannot take any power -- cannot take any part of a municipality serve --
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3945.089,3946.781,"Oh, I know but that isn't one of my question --"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3946.781,3948.064,You're -- and here outside the Tazewell?
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3948.064,3948.92,I believe yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3948.92,3949.233,Alright.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3951.275,3951.456,I know but --
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3951.456,3953.217,But the answer to it is this.
1967.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.538,3988.653,I think it would be a contrary to the Act if one of the customers you are now serving in that corridor outside of Tazewell ask the TVA to supply them power and the TVA build a line into -- or one of their distributors build a line into them and supply them.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,3988.653,3993.664,"Yes, I think it would be contrary to the Act because they can only do that Mr. Justice White."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4032.926,4034.718,I haven't got the (Inaudible).
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4050.228,4058.677,The Roe-Osborn map made jointly between KU and TVA as distributor of Powell Valley delineates the boundary.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4061.534,4062.969,Delineates the boundaries?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4062.969,4065.067,Between KU and Powell Valley.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4065.067,4073.561,"Well, that should be a pretty clear, easily understood thing if that's what the -- TVA agreed that that map represents the boundaries?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4073.561,4076.109,TVA did not agree to the making of the map.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4082.52,4083.916,Alright.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4083.916,4092.094,I don't think it disputes the fact set out in the map but it did not agree in the sense of contractual -- or didn't participate in the making of the map.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4092.094,4102.16,"Wouldn't the -- if -- what does the TVA say -- what do they say, we should look at to determine where its boundary results."
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4102.16,4107.973,That's a difficult question for me to answer because part of our position in this lawsuit is that they offer you no standard.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4123.506,4127.291,It's a very strange method for business to be done.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4141.023,4148.31,"Mr. Justice Black, I think we have pointed in this record the facts which showed very sharply what the division is."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4149.049,4154.374,"Well, do we have to determine that from circumstantial evidence, the map?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4154.374,4155.602,It is a matter of fact.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4160.904,4161.881,They never agreed on --
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4161.881,4162.926,-- in customers.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4162.926,4165.535,"They've never agreed on, is that right?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4165.535,4166.727,KU and TVA?
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4166.727,4167.131,Yes.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4167.131,4169.313,"As far as I know, that's right."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4169.313,4174.178,"Well, have any representative of TVA have agreed to this KU?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4174.178,4175.089,On the boundary in this particular --
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4175.089,4176.756,That's right.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4176.756,4184.524,"Other than as Powell Valley is a representative of TVA, I would have to say no."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4184.524,4189.72,"Well, did you all -- did either one of you offer any evidence to the judge to show where its division was?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4189.72,4190.616,Yes sir.
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4190.71,4191.934,What kind of evidence?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4191.934,4198.809,"Evidence as to the location of facilities, customers and service on the date of the Act and that's the only way I know to fix the --"
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4198.809,4210.269,Is it your claim that the map that (Inaudible) “the division which existed on the day the Act was passed”.
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4210.269,4212.34,"You just say, -- is it my claiming that the Act --"
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4212.34,4216.776,"Does the Act, the day it was found (Inaudible) the division --"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4216.776,4217.638,"Oh, I missed that."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4217.638,4218.951,-- that existed at that time?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4218.951,4220.556,"Yes, precisely."
1967.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4220.556,4222.017,Do they agree to that?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4222.017,4223.938,I think so.
1967.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4235.709,4242.089,"Is there any -- is there a finding in the trial court -- the trial court can't hold against you, do they?"
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4242.089,4243.171,Yes sir.
1967.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4243.171,4247.197,Was there a fact finding under this thing that Mr. Justice Black was asking you?
1967.40,2,36329,malcolm_y_marshall,,4247.197,4248.848,"As to the boundary, I would say no."
1967.40,3,39852,robert_h_marquis,,5998.837,6000.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.40,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6000.76,6003.213,"May I ask, Mr. Welch are you going to --"
1967.40,3,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6003.213,6004.272,I beg your pardon.

1967.40,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6015.075,6016.13,You may proceed.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6016.13,6018.458,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6094.651,6097.542,What discretion do you have a right to (Inaudible)?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6097.542,6109.466,"I think Your Honor that we have the right to determine the periphery of that area for which we were the primary source of power supply, the chief supplier or the principal supplier."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6109.466,6113.101,But were you the primary source of supplier in Tazewell?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6113.101,6124.299,No sir but I think we were in Cumberland County as a whole and I think that the Tazewells were islands inside that primary area.
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6268.091,6269.028,May I ask you one more question --
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6269.028,6269.477,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6269.477,6272.98,-- on your position on the island.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6281.446,6281.887,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6281.887,6282.522,Both of them.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6282.522,6283.653,That's correct.
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6283.653,6289.633,And that it's the purpose to leave those islands open to competition --
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6289.633,6290.018,That --
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6290.018,6290.816,-- in the two?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6290.816,6292.534,That's exactly correct Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6301.012,6302.868,How do your rates compare?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6302.868,6304.175,"Well, our rates are lower than theirs."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6307.572,6315.459,"It would reserve, I presume eventually in the TVA getting -- selling all those islands completely, would it not?"
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6315.459,6316.206,In those islands?
1967.40,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6318.345,6323.26,Did you say that the rates in the company were two and a half times your rate --
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6323.26,6328.036,"For an electrically heated home of average size, their rates were two and a half times as high."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6329.849,6335.111,Now why do you claim that the Congress intended to leave those open to competition?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6335.111,6347.536,"Because Your Honor, they spoke and the legislative history clearly shows it that they intended that there be adjustments around the periphery and within the periphery."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6373.739,6376.137,That describes in the situation in Tazewell.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6376.137,6376.817,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6376.817,6378.728,Now what did they -- what policy?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6383.826,6395.132,"Because it explained, if I read it correctly, the kind of adjustments within the periphery of our area that they anticipated would take place and should take place."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6395.132,6396.453,In the periphery you say?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6396.453,6397.444,Inside the periphery.
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6397.444,6401.383,What side -- what size do you think a periphery is?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6401.383,6401.897,What size?
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6401.897,6404.111,What size is the periphery?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6404.111,6421.162,"Well, we would say Your Honor that the periphery is a more accurately drawn -- of line around our -- the area in which we are the chief supplier and that would approximate the line on that big map although it is exactly accurate."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6451.051,6452.371,Who said that?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6452.371,6456.537,"Senator Randolph, Your Honor, and he proposed the amendment on the Senate floor, it was finally adopted."
1967.40,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6456.537,6459.518,He proposed the very legislation on which they rely?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6459.518,6461.756,That is correct Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6461.756,6462.757,Tell me Mr. Marquis.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6462.757,6463.227,Certainly Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6463.227,6471.716,What is the -- I gather you concede that one purpose of (Inaudible) to this legislation was to protect the five --
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6471.716,6472.09,Yes Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6472.09,6473.224,-- utilities or something.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6477.765,6478.654,In this area?
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6478.654,6479.093,Yes.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6479.093,6485.305,"Well, I don't concede that it was the purpose of Congress in anyway to protect the islands within our perimeter."
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6486.092,6487.765,(Inaudible) my question.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6487.921,6488.87,I'm sorry.
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6488.87,6490.578,In what way they were being protected?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6491.626,6508.615,In the -- they were to be protected by confining TVA service within the periphery of the primary area plus the five-mile belt around it plus the third area I mentioned --
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6508.615,6508.755,Well --
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6508.755,6509.302,-- in any particular towns that might be involved.
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6509.302,6511.987,It could be the (Voice Overlap)?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6512.853,6513.527,"Oh, surely Your Honor."
1967.40,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6513.527,6515.435,It's protected (Inaudible).
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6515.435,6516.52,It's protected Middlesborough.
1967.40,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6526.247,6531.03,I will put this very simply in a rough language.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6544.9,6545.076,Precisely.
1967.40,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6545.076,6560.372,In the sense of cleaning out -- providing competition to pockets which are -- may now be served by private utility companies but then stay in that area and don't go outside of it except for the five-mile limitation.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6560.386,6560.609,That's --
1967.40,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6560.609,6561.103,-- where you look at it.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6561.103,6562.513,That's exactly correct Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6562.809,6584.806,"Oh, do you agree with the -- with your opponent that in that so-called corridor, what if -- would you tell us that or not or however wide or narrow it is, within that corridor outside Tazewell, the TVA may not serve customers which are now served by KU."
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6584.806,6587.134,"No Your Honor, I certainly do not."
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6593.763,6596.639,"Alright, but that's on a different basis."
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6596.913,6597.532,Yes.
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6597.532,6613.486,"-- there -- but now let's assume that they -- that you agreed that the KU -- that you do have a boundary line inside with them, that that corridor does exist that that is the boundary line between KU and TVA."
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6616.303,6616.398,We would --
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6616.398,6617.912,-- outside Tazewell?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6617.912,6623.69,We would contend Your Honor that the five-miles would take in everything except for the town of Cumberland Gap.
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6624.682,6626.446,And Tazewell?
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6626.446,6629.593,"No, not Tazewell for the reason of the five miles."
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6641.765,6651.862,"I understand that but do you think if -- do you think it is just an open invitation, an open right to expand beyond your perimeter of five miles except in (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6651.862,6652.718,Yes Your Honor.
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6660.166,6661.303,Okay.
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6661.303,6664.46,I will simply say that I think that's just a descriptive word.
1967.40,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6696.104,6701.009,(Inaudible)
1967.40,5,39852,robert_h_marquis,,6701.009,6701.535,Yes.
1967.40,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6938.712,6939.436,Very well.
