2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.13,6.445,"We'll hear first this morning Case 17-155, Hughes versus the United States. Mr. Shumsky."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,6.445,18.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plurality and the concurrence in Freeman recognized two ways that a sentence following a C-type agreement can be based on the guidelines."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.32,56.42,"Mr. Shumsky, could you address one issue for me on this question? In a (C) agreement, the government is giving up, often, certain things."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,98.28,119.23,"Justice Sotomayor, let me answer the question in two parts if I can. First of all, those conditions, the way Your Honor describes C-type agreements, are true also for B-type agreements and for the sort of C-type agreements that the government concedes open the door to eligibility for relief under 3582(c)(2)."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.81,140.75,"Except that -- let's take -- dismissing charges, I -- I think it could be seen as relatively easy."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,174.12,177.16,"Well, so -- Justice Sotomayor, let me push back a little bit still --"
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,177.16,177.25,Okay.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,177.25,180.975,-- on the first part of my answer and then -- and then get to the second part.
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,251.705,266.245,When wouldn't any -- what would disqualify a defendant from eligibility? The plurality said this determination has to be made on a case-by-case basis.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,274.145,278.845,Let me answer again in two ways and again maybe in exactly the same two ways.
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.19,291.29,"No, I'm saying we read the transcript."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,321.4,332.785,"Well, just to clarify, Your Honor, if it is a -- a sentence under 1B1.10 cannot drop below the bottom of an amended guidelines range."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,341.04,346.185,So are you conceding there's no -- you can't imagine a scenario where someone wouldn't be eligible?
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,346.185,347.28,"No, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,451.335,467.19,"The first question we posed was how to apply Marks in this situation, and I wonder if I'm a court of appeals judge, it seems to me the most important thing in deciding the case is to make sure that I'm not reversed."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,488.305,498.44,"I would say a couple of things about that, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, Marks focuses on the holding or the judgment of the Court."
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,546.845,547.61,But as a practical --
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,547.61,550.25,"Well, suppose we -- no, you go ahead."
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,550.25,557.63,"As a practical matter, though, in a particular case, that would have the court of appeals writing an opinion that would be subject to reversal."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,557.63,561.1,"And that -- and that, Mr. Chief Justice, is the other thing I was going to say."
2017.17-155,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.52,610.435,"Then why should they -- why should they pretend that this Court had an opinion that counts as precedent? They can say: All right, we see four justices thought this, two justices thought that, and we're going to read those opinions and then give our best judgment of what the right answer is without being bound by a minority of the justices."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,610.435,614.76,"Justice Ginsburg, that -- we think that that is exactly correct."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,689.94,731.64,"Well, Marks has been the -- the law for 40 years, and for better or worse, it has had a big effect, I think, on what we have understood to be the jurisprudence of this Court and what the lower courts have understood to be our precedents and on the way in which justices of this Court go about doing their job. And if we abandon anything like Marks, perhaps it requires -- it certainly could benefit from some clarification and maybe some refinement -- but if we abandon it completely, it could have pretty profound changes."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,733.105,739.72,"Justice Alito, our first argument, of course, is that the Court should refine Marks."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,754.34,762.985,"Well, you know, Professor -- Professor Re wrote an interesting amicus brief in this case arguing that the logical subset approach is illogical."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,796.83,799.685,"Justice Alito, the answer is it depends."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,803.44,806.2,"Well, suppose we know nothing more than that."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,806.2,828.2,"Then it is a fair presumption, at least under certain circumstances, I can't speak to romantic comedies in French, but there are a couple of this Court's precedents under which, contrary to what Professor Re has said, logical subsets do, in fact, make a great sense -- a great deal of sense, if not all the time, then nearly all the time."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,828.42,839.13,"I mean, if that's a logical subset, I think there's a serious problem with the argument because the four who want to see a romantic comedy might think: I don't want to see anything in a foreign language, particularly in French."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,843.005,870.22,"So, Justice Alito, and I think this is the key to the -- the puzzle, anytime two people, be they justices of this Court or people going to see a romantic comedy, can say here's how far I go, but I don't agree with that thing over there. And so sometimes we see justices saying: I take an absolutist view and anything less than that is legally wrong."
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,883.66,883.89,"Well, that --"
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,883.89,885.29,-- as a way of understanding --
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,885.29,889.495,"I'm -- I'm sorry, but that means that you would want them to engage in -- in dicta."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,933.52,935.18,"I don't think it is, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.56,992.27499995,That's covered by Marks automatically.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,992.27499995,996.29,I'm not sure what it means to say that something is covered --
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.29,1002.55,Meaning Marks says what's the narrowest holding of a plurality in a concurrence.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1016.32,1024.22,"Again, two points, Justice Sotomayor. I think that -- that the language of narrowest in Marks is, frankly, part of the problem here."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1032.77,1049.39,"Why -- but -- is the confusion -- is the -- why is the confusion necessarily so evil? Meaning, the government makes a counterpoint which says you want something to -- to follow a split decision by the Court."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1075.315,1084.59,"I think the strength of Professor Re's view, Justice Sotomayor, is that the current situation is not, in fact, providing much, if any, guidance."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1097.26,1097.76,Mr. Shumsky?
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1097.76,1098.575,-- simply that --
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1098.575,1099.28,I'm sorry.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1100.165,1108.45,"Well, simply that -- that to return to the -- the older historical norm of actual majority rule would provide clarity."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1115.44,1125.71,"I mean, the question is, what is the second best? We're in a world in which the first-best option, which is five people agreeing on the reasoning, that doesn't exist."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1198.83,1210.56,"So, just to clarify if I may, Justice Kagan, and then to turn to that, our position is not that there should be chaos, nor -- nor, at least in the first instance, that the Re argument is the best one."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1215.25,1225.385,"Well, you carve out a set of cases, and then, when it's not completely nested in the way that you want it to be, you vote for chaos."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1232.075,1243.22,"So, to be clear, Justice Kagan, and I -- I don't want to quibble, but, I mean, the idea is not that it's chaos; it's that the lower courts can then percolate the issue, as this Court often invites them to do."
2017.17-155,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.22,1243.39,"Well, why --"
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1243.39,1243.94,But let me --
2017.17-155,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.94,1244.95,"Yeah, go ahead."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1244.95,1250.66,"Sorry, let me -- let me turn to the question about the -- the running the facts through the opinions approach."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1276.9,1284.02,"Well, Mr. Shumsky, I think -- I think your approach relies on dissents sometimes too, because take one of these logical subset cases."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1299.7,1313.115,"To be very clear about this, Your Honor, that is not our position, that the concurring opinion would only be given force insofar as to -- or, the extent that it is an opinion that is necessary to the judgment."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1314.04,1325.485,"It's necessary to the judgment, but the result of applying -- but, you know, the plurality would grant relief in this much -- this many cases."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1349.1,1350.66,"I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1362.79,1388.885,"I'm talking about a case in which it is completely nested, but the -- but -- it is completely nested, but the concurrence is sometimes granting the relief that the plurality would but sometimes, instead, reaching the result the dissent would. And by saying the concurrence controls in those cases, you're giving effect to the times when the concurrence plus the dissent equals five."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1388.885,1406.47,"I think that for the same reasons I was indicating about reliance on -- about the importance of holdings, we would not say that it controls under those circumstances. Now perhaps the next case might come up and there would be an opportunity to evaluate that, but, Justice Kagan, I want to make sure to answer --"
2017.17-155,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1406.47,1409.65,"So, in those circumstances, there is no result?"
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1409.65,1450.86,"Well, there would be a bare result, certainly, but the concurrence would not be controlling as to cases in which it has to be paired with the dissent. I want to make sure to answer directly your question, Justice Kagan, about what's wrong with the government's approach, and then I might try and -- and turn back to the -- the 3582 question for a moment if I can. What is wrong with the government's approach is not just that it is contrary to these pretty fundamental notions about precedent and holdings but because it would stunt the development of the law. It would say at precisely the moment at which this Court is unable to reach a majority, the lower courts should stop trying to sort these issues out."
2017.17-155,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1462.34,1462.99,I'm sorry.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1492.415,1512.45,"I think the point is a bit different, Justice Sotomayor, in the following way: The idea would be that once this Court splinters and when there is no middle ground, as the government puts it, at that point, all that is left for a lower court to do is run the facts through the opinions. You don't think about the issue further."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1522.08,1537.07,"Well, can I just ask you this quick question? Suppose that there's a majority of the Court that -- that agrees that a particular party is entitled to relief, but there is no majority as to the provision of the Constitution that provides the relief. What happens in that situation?"
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1537.07,1537.4,I --
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1537.4,1546.41,So that's never a precedent unless one of the two -- and both of these groups feel very strongly that the other is wrong in identifying the constitutional provision.
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1550.7,1560.405,"I think that -- let me answer your question, Justice Alito, and then -- and then reserve the balance of my time. I think that that is the quintessential case in which there is not precedent."
2017.17-155,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1573.8,1578.555,So the lower courts would then be free to deny relief in -- in all these cases?
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1578.555,1585.59,"In a case just like the one that had been before the Court, surely -- and this goes to my answer to the Chief Justice."
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.615,1600.44,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-155,0,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,1600.44,1603.39500005,Thank you.
2017.17-155,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.39500005,1606.755,Ms. Kovner.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1606.755,1612.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The circuit split here concerns the interpretation of the Marks rule."
2017.17-155,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.51,1669.84,Even though it's the opinion of only one.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1701.38999995,1724.145,"That's right, Your Honor. I think that this Court has consistently applied Marks in that way by picking an opinion that's not subscribed to by the members -- by all the members of the Court or by a majority and describing that as the controlling opinion. And I think the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that when the Court applies that opinion, it's not applying an opinion that leads to the result that's favored by only one member of the Court."
2017.17-155,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1735.57,1737.36,"That might be true, but it might not be."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1767.68,1805.74,"So we think ordinarily that the opinions in the case itself will deal with that in the following sense: So, to take Freeman as an example, there's, I think, a sort of broad opinion, a in-between opinion, and a narrow opinion. And it's true that some opinions in Freeman criticize the middle ground, but, nevertheless, the plurality in Freeman voted with the concurrence to create a common result. I think if the plurality thought that it were intolerable to have that middle ground position control the day, the plurality could say, given that we can't have our rule, our second choice is the categorical rule on the other side, and could join that opinion. But we think the plurality indicated through its vote that that's not what it wanted to have happen."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.55,1812.265,"So how -- look, I -- I don't know what I'd write in this case."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1877.17,1881.08,So I -- I think the question that lower courts are in need of guidance on in this case --
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.08,1881.6,"Well, what guidance?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1881.6,1882.135,Yes.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.43,1882.99,"I mean, what?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1882.99,1883.23,Sure.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.23,1884.52,You talk about the French movie.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.83,1891.54,"There I say, you mean they really don't want to see The Philadelphia Story? They must be crazy."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1892.78,1898.615,"But -- but -- but -- but you see, if you have, of course, a real French comedy, fine."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.0,1908.005,"I mean, that's what law is about."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1915.19,1915.34,So --
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.34,1917.555,And say -- interpret it with common sense.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1917.555,1929.57,"So I agree with that, but I think there is one clarification that there's a circuit split on and it would be helpful for this Court to resolve. There are two circuits that say, contrary to the views of other circuits, that you need to have not only shared results, which I think is --"
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.57,1930.15,You say they're wrong.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1930.15,1930.73,"That's right, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.73,1932.36,"And then they say what's right, we don't tell them."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1932.36,1942.43,"No, I think if the Court can say, Marks, and I think the one thing that the Court can add to Marks if it wants to provide further guidance, is that what the Marks rule is doing is it's achieving vertical stare decisis."
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1965.045,1986.455,"May I ask two questions? I don't want you to ignore the third question of the petition. But the first one is, if we are able to reach a majority in the Freeman question, should we reach the Marks inquiry, and, if so, how and why? I mean, we usually -- it would be pure dicta."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1986.455,1987.54,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2031.65,2039.155,As -- and what the prosecutors are now doing is making a waiver of any amendment of the guidelines in almost all (C) agreements.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2039.155,2041.83,"I -- I don't -- I actually don't think that's the case empirically, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2051.71,2058.015,Now I have a question on the substance of the -- of the plurality's position.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2098.88,2106.68,"That's right, Your Honor. I think that once Freeman was established, we can expect the parties to negotiate around the rule in Freeman."
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2125.41,2138.995,"Except the plurality says there's a player that you're not considering, which is the judge, and the judge accepts the agreement because a prosecutor has gotten up and said we think it should be within the guidelines."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2150.95,2171.0,"So I think, you know, both Your Honor's opinion in Freeman and the dissenting opinion in Freeman sort of note that there's a real difference between background considerations that go into what the deal is and then what the sort of deal ultimately is. Ultimately, in a (C) agreement, you know, the parties bargain for a specific determinate sentence and they urge the court to impose that -- that sentence."
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2228.07,2236.445,"Well, that's -- that's the way I phrased the question earlier, but really the question is not what will the parties do? The question really is what will I do?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2236.445,2236.85,I --
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2236.85,2249.215,"I mean, because every (C) agreement before it takes effect has to be approved by the judge. So really it's the judge who has to determine would I have accepted this or not --"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2249.215,2249.65,I --
2017.17-155,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.65,2252.195,-- knowing that the guideline was in error?
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2252.195,2263.96,"I actually think that's the way in which a C plea is fundamentally different from other kinds of pleas, as -- as Your Honor's opinion in Freeman alludes to, which is part of a -- part of a C plea is that the parties agreed to it."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.165,2323.05,"In a (C) agreement, it says, the Commission, that the judge -- it's the judge who will depart if that's the agreement, and it says the agreed -- he has to write his reasons in writing as to why the agreed sentence ""departs from the applicable guideline range"" for justifiable reasons. So, if the guideline range is 120 months, he says why it departs from that, and he has some reasons."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2365.445,2369.91,"So I think this case is a -- is a really good example, Justice Breyer, of why that doesn't work."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.83,2378.705,"No, I don't know. All I have to know is what the judge would have done."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2382.36,2382.46,Right.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.46,2389.08,-- repeating what I said. So we know in every sentence like that there will be words about the applicable guideline.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2389.08,2389.6,Yes.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.6,2393.78,"And much of the time, it will have something to do with the applicable guideline."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2395.41,2405.7,"So, Justice Breyer, to take, for instance, this case, there is no reason to believe, I think, in this case that the judge would have rejected the parties' plea agreement if the judge had calculated the guidelines differently."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.365,2458.135,"Suppose we say you're absolutely right, and that's why the word ""based upon"" cannot just refer to these hypotheticals we know nothing about. Therefore, ""based upon"" refers to an instance where the judge made significant use of the guideline, either in his reasoning or in the reasons that he gave, which, of course, would throw this case right into the opposite side that you want."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2464.085,2466.13,So I think there are a few reasons.
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.36,2480.06,"In a (C) agreement, it would be because he has to write it down."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2480.06,2493.15,"I -- I think all he has to indicate is that there were justifiable reasons for him to accept the sentence, notwithstanding that -- notwithstanding that the sentence in a particular case was outside the guidelines. And I think there's some additional reasons why that approach wouldn't be a good one."
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2528.44,2553.13,"No, I understand you'd like us to decide what we're calling the Marks question, rather than just resolving what Freeman means. But to what extent is the Marks problem real outside of the Freeman context? I know Freeman has beset the lower courts with a lot of difficulty and generated disagreements. But have -- have there been real problems outside of that context?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2553.13,2565.06,"So, I mean, the -- the courts that have gone against us on the Marks question have indicated it's sort of their -- it's just their interpretation of Marks, so it's the interpretation they would apply in future --"
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2565.06,2568.035,But they've done it in the context of trying to figure out what Freeman means.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2572.24,2577.9,"I don't think very far, Your Honor, because in any future divided decision of this Court, those courts would go back to applying the requirement --"
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2577.9,2580.35,"There are a lot of divided decisions of this Court, though."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2580.35,2580.86,That's right.
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2580.86,2587.68,"And -- and it doesn't seem to be a pervasive problem outside of the Freeman context, at least that you've documented so far."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2591.35,2598.45,"So I think an -- an additional circumstance, you know, some of the amicus briefs allude to is interpreting this Court's decision in Rapanos."
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2615.58,2619.22,"But are there actual opinions, I guess, is -- I'm sorry for pursuing this --"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2619.22,2619.39,Yes.
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2619.39,2624.995,-- but I'll stop. But -- but are there -- are there any other actual decisions like we have in the Marks?
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2624.995,2625.75,So I --
2017.17-155,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2625.75,2627.1,In -- in the Freeman context?
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2627.1,2633.78,"This is often, I think, briefed in -- I know there are a lot of cases discussing this Marks issue in the context of Rapanos."
2017.17-155,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2664.67,2665.04,Don't you think that --
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2665.04,2667.8,But those courts have set out rules that are going to apply in future cases.
2017.17-155,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.8,2675.19,"Didn't the commentary that's been referred to, Re and the other one, give lots of examples?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2675.19,2680.655,I think they -- the -- the -- Professor Re's brief I take to indicate --
2017.17-155,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.655,2681.38,Not the brief.
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2682.83,2683.555,Yes.
2017.17-155,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.305,2706.67,"It has been said that -- in one of the briefs, that the government in several cases endorsed this so-called Russian doll approach."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2710.965,2717.195,"No, I mean, in -- I know in the cases interpreting Rapanos, the government has consistently taken the position we've interpreted here."
2017.17-155,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2736.665,2754.275,"If we followed the -- your predictive approach, why should we -- could it not be confined to the opinions that concurred in the judgment? Why should we count the dissents? Why -- why not just look at the -- the -- the ones that concurred in the judgment?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2754.275,2819.51,"So I -- I take the Marks rule -- I think that would be contrary to what this Court has said and done for about 40 years where it said you identify the narrowest opinion concurring in the judgment and then you treat that as the controlling rule, even though in some cases that opinion aligns with the dissent and in some cases with the plurality. And we think that's the right rule, Justice Alito, because, otherwise, in every Marks case, the Court would essentially need to take the case twice, once for the cases where the plurality assigns -- aligns with the concurrence and once for the cases where the concurrence assigns with the -- aligns with the dissent. And in that case, the members of this Court could issue identical opinions to the ones they issued in the first case because all of the opinions have already fleshed out exactly what rule the justices are applying, but it would need to essentially -- this Court would need to essentially take the case twice. The rule that was set out in the first case would depend somewhat arbitrarily on the vehicle in which the Court initially granted cert. We don't think there's any need for the Court to expend its resources in this way, and the effect would be an undesirable one for purposes of vertical stare decisis, where for a period of time you would have courts not -- not being bound by what five members of the Court have indicated is the appropriate rule."
2017.17-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2819.51,2830.705,"As best you interpret the Re brief and the Re article, is it your position or would it be your position that overruling Marks would be disruptive?"
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2830.705,2832.14,"I -- I think so, Your Honor."
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.08,2874.375,"When you say that Marks is fine for the cases that it works with which are a logical subset, fine, but it doesn't deal with every case."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2896.07,2905.43,"So, I mean, we agree that the Court doesn't need to consider or decide cases that are not before it, but we would urge the Court to clarify that there's no requirement of --"
2017.17-155,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.43,2906.19,"Yeah, I see."
2017.17-155,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2906.19,2919.85000005,"-- of common reasoning. And, you know, to go on and say in this case the court -- lower court was correct to apply Marks to the straightforward application of Marks. If there are no further questions, we would urge that the judgment be affirmed."

Justice Sotomayor, I'd like to start with your hypothetical in the circumstance in which the prosecutor says the sentence here, the agreement here, was based on the guidelines. The lower courts following Freeman have interpreted the concurring opinion in Freeman as prohibiting reliance on that."
2017.17-155,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2948.66,2950.39,I -- I'm not in disagreement with that.
2017.17-155,2,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,2981.52,2982.54,Let me --
2017.17-155,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2982.54,2986.225,"Doing it the way the plurality suggests, they're losing that chance."
2017.17-155,2,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,2986.225,3003.56,"Justice Sotomayor, let me try and address this as sharply as I can. This is where we started the colloquy at the beginning of this argument, and I think it's critical. The government is not losing the benefit of any bargain here, and it is certainly not in any greater way than it is for any other form of plea agreement."
2017.17-155,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3003.56,3003.765,"Well, you're --"

2017.17-155,2,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,3007.195,3007.7,No.
2017.17-155,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3007.91,3009.19,This is like all (B) agreements.
2017.17-155,2,23234,eric_a_shumsky,,3009.19,3037.01,"-- because, remember, we have other types of (C) agreements with a range and the government says those ones are fine. We don't mind giving away the benefit of our bargain for (C) agreements with a range, because there, again, when Congress in these narrow circumstances has said the Commission, again, in narrow circumstances, is applying a guide -- is applying a change retroactively, under those circumstances, the bargain has changed."
