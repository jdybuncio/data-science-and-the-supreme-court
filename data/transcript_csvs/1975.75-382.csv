1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.753,"We will hear arguments in 75-382, Federal Emergency Administration against Algonquin."
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,31.836,33.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,111.411,115.019,Has that defense been raised under along the line?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,115.019,118.078,"It was discussed below Justice Blackmun, but it was --"
1975.75-382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,118.078,120.556,Certainly here there is no disagreement about it as I gather?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,120.556,125.962,"There is no about disagreement about it, but we request it was discussed by the Court."
1975.75-382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.338,678.721,"The Agricultural Adjustment Act as I understand it is explicit in authorizing duties, is it not?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,678.721,681.024,That is quite correct.
1975.75-382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.024,682.118,Unlike this statute.
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,682.118,683.154,"Unlike this, but that is right."
1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,689.502,698.941,"As in understood this Act is much broader, that is powers of the President are much broader that he may do anything he deems necessary?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,698.941,701.905,I do not really claim that he may do anything he may deem necessary.
1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,704.158,707.018,"It has been used in some such language, does it not?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,707.018,715.175,"Or steps that he deems necessary, but I think Mr. Chief Justice that we are talking about an area in which he may deem things necessary."
1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,756.365,770.937,Can you suggest any statutes giving executive powers that are in any broader language than this to take such action as he deems necessary and do we have other statutes that are broader than that?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,770.937,779.507,"Well, there is broader authority in general under the Trading with the Enemy Act which is discussed at page 51 of our opening brief."
1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.507,783.985,It comes generally under the emergency type of statute?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,783.985,800.511,"Well, during time of war or declared national emergency which he can declare I suppose, directs plenty of control over properties, etcetera, it is just not bad as almost without standards whereas I think this statute does have standards, it does have criteria."
1975.75-382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.511,802.318,Just to adjust the inputs?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,802.318,811.994,"Well, yes Mr. Justice Stewart, but in some subsection C, there are a list of topics that the President should consider in making the decision."
1975.75-382,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,821.055,836.131,"Mr. Solicitor, to oversimplify you say that it is restricted to tariffs and quotas, Congress could easily have said that?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,836.131,837.404,Oh it could easily but --
1975.75-382,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.404,841.316,The Congress preferred to use that broad language now what we do with that?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,841.316,848.916,"Well, I suggest Mr. Justice Marshall, of course they did mention the possibility of stockpiling and there may be other restrictive actions."
1975.75-382,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.683,875.65,"Just limited it to the floor, is it not?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,875.65,877.295,I did not mean to do that Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.75-382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.587,1183.497,"Mr. Solicitor General Bork, what authority does Congress rely on to levy an ordinary tariff, is it the power to tax or the power of commerce law?"
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1183.497,1197.378,"The ordinary tariff, I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist is the power of tax, but in common parlance it is called taxes under commerce power to regulate in the past."
1975.75-382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.103,1202.558,"Mr. Solicitor General, give me an example or two."
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1203.791,1211.246,"Well, I confess that there is a case in the 30s that may be in the bottom, I am not sure, I have to find that out."
1975.75-382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.246,1212.829,We have some spending power just --
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1212.829,1212.897,Well.
1975.75-382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.058,1218.159,On the use of monetary exactions to regulate commerce?
1975.75-382,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1218.159,1218.736,Yes.
1975.75-382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.065,1624.67,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1627.298,1630.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-382,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1664.454,1668.486,"Mr. Attorney General, why are you so concerned about the Anti-Injunction Act here?"
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1668.486,1682.369,"I do not know Your Honor, except that we were asked to brief it and argue it and the basis of request to this Court, we have done that and I have come down here to argue it and I am not at all sure that that is an essential argument at this point."
1975.75-382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.369,1687.167,The Solicitor General agrees with you.
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1688.858,1691.253,There is no debate Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-382,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1691.253,1693.607,Court to ask the parties to?
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1693.607,1698.382,"Yes, Your Honor, and the parties cannot confer a jurisdiction upon this Court and I am not at all sure."
1975.75-382,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.382,1703.022,(Voice Overlap) my brother Blackmun had directed that question?
1975.75-382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.022,1708.801,But the answers of some members of the Court were concerned about it and want to do hear and they are not heard?
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1708.801,1712.069,"I will do whatever it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.087,1727.744,You may make your own election and see if any questions will prolong your argument on the subject.
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1727.744,1731.532,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, I will just take a few minutes on this."
1975.75-382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.042,1768.65,So always there were any difference with respect to the rules of that delegation with respect to tax.
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1771.778,1772.929,This is not a tax.
1975.75-382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.019,1827.115,"General Bellotti, what if an action were brought to enjoin the enforcement of tariffs enacted by Congress, would that be subject to the Anti-Injunction Act?"
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1827.115,1829.992,I would say that would not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1975.75-382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.992,1835.117,Even though levied under -- even though Congress was exercising its taxing power?
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1835.117,1850.437,"No, the Anti-Injunction Act applies, in my judgment, very simply to taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code Title XXIV and no others."
1975.75-382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.33,1950.612,"(Inaudible) questions Mr. Attorney General, or you may either argue the other points or you may delegate and assign that time to your colleague."
1975.75-382,1,23598,francis_x_bellotti,,1950.612,1968.786,"In the interest Mr. Chief Justice, having no overlapping arguments I will give my time to Mr. Dondis."
1975.75-382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.786,1969.92,Mr. Dondis.
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,1969.92,1973.706,"Thank you, Your Honor and may it please the Court."
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.545,2048.184,What do you say was the objective of Congress in this particular section?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2048.184,2051.054,It was to put on a quota Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.587,2068.587,"To adjust and regulate imports, is that not the objective?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2068.587,2075.237,"Yes, but I will explain the term the word “adjust.”"
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.218,2130.476,Is your position that this is a tax?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2130.476,2139.47,"This is a license fee Your Honor which has reach that reaches farther, much broader than a tariff and I will explain why it does."
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.47,2141.57,It is not a tax so to speak?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2141.57,2151.329,"I have to accept the nomenclature of the government as in licensed tax, but it has all the instance of the tariff and something more."
1975.75-382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.329,2153.287,I have to change my notes here.
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2159.35,2162.708,"Yes, I will explain why I do not think it is a tax."
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2168.165,2170.615,(Inaudible) you may find yourself under the Anti-Injunction Act?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2170.615,2182.881,"No, I do not think you would Your Honor because I do not like to argue that question, but there is a clear right of appeal under the Federal Energy Act in any event."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.554,2245.856,Mr. Dondis did you make this argument in the lower court?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2245.856,2246.817,Yes.
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.817,2251.39,But the District Court did not pass -- the Court of Appeals did not pass on the same?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2251.39,2254.471,"No, I do not think they finally characterizes it."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.984,2263.154,What is your response to the Solicitor General’s argument that we may not consider it because it would not sustain the judgment before us?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2263.154,2264.464,On the uniformity provisions?
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.464,2265.197,Yes.
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2265.197,2277.158,"Oh well, I simply say that they -- the government has chosen the form of the system and I am personally convinced that it was chosen to get around the Uniformity Act."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.534,2298.452,I may not understand your argument.
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2310.229,2329.273,"No, it is one to demonstrate that this statute should be very carefully and narrowly construed and if there is a constitutional question, then the tariff should be construed as to avoid and not allow a license tax system at all."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.273,2336.09,There is no constitutional question derived from the non-uniformity point unless we decided it is a tariff?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2336.09,2339.22,"Well, I would think it would apply in the case of a license fee system."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.22,2343.387,Why the constitution requires a license fee system to be uniform?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2343.387,2348.684,"Because if a license fee has all the effects of a tariff Your Honor, I think it would have to bring down --"
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.684,2358.982,"But for example could not the President say we will have no imports at all through the west coast or the east coast, one or the other, just close up certain ports to the import of oil, could that be done?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2358.982,2364.472,I think he could do that subject to the restrictions of the Due Process Clause.
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.98,2374.119,Do you make a due process argument here?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2374.119,2376.397,"No, we are not a constitutional question."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.397,2382.259,"I do not understand, the thrust of your non-uniformity argument, I really do not have it yet?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2382.259,2394.844,"Well, I can only say we are bringing before the Court a question of the interpretation of the statutes and we say the statute must be interpreted narrowly --"
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.844,2400.682,"It is supposed to be interpreted to require uniform treatment of all parts of the country, if there were for example?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2400.682,2407.387,"Yes, and this program not only provides the uniform treatment and this is not what the government has done."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.222,2417.108,"If they had quotas administered by different ports of the country, they have to be uniform in every port, is what you say?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2417.108,2418.328,"Yes, they could hardly do that."
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.173,2479.914,"There is quite a difference, does it not?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2479.914,2480.862,Pardon.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.862,2482.764,That makes some difference on this?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2482.764,2485.546,But how much difference Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.698,2529.762,"What would have hurt client the most, an embargo or just license fee?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2529.762,2533.462,The license fee is a devastating.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.371,2538.959,How about in embargo?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2538.959,2542.405,"Well, I am not sure what an embargo could be put on."
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.298,2553.239,"Maybe, but what about under the statute, would the President have the power to do it?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2553.239,2559.888,The President has the power of quota and it is a very large reconic power.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.116,2569.094,I just wonder if you want to narrow construction whether you want to construe it narrowly to exclude quotas?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2569.094,2569.425,No.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.425,2570.924,Narrowly to exclude license fees?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2570.924,2581.772,There is no way because the word “restrict” clearly implies quotas and because the statutory history again and again refers to quotas.
1975.75-382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.653,2620.326,"To buy that argument, we have to find that this is actually a tax?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2620.326,2621.748,What is that?
1975.75-382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2621.748,2628.008,"Before we can buy that argument, we have to agree with you that it is a tax?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2628.008,2629.209,"No, I do not think so."
1975.75-382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.475,2639.442,"Well, if we find that this is not a tax, what good is your present argument?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2639.442,2650.933,I think it is in violative of the tariff clause and it is not within the power granted to Congress.
1975.75-382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.933,2652.978,Do you say that Congress could have not done this?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2652.978,2658.017,"I mean, I am sorry, the power granted by Congress obviously."
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.125,2765.504,You agree I suppose that this is just a question of statutory --?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2765.504,2769.052,"Yes, I do."
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.052,2779.713,"And that if whichever way we decided in a way that Congress does not prove, they can pretty quickly change the situation?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2779.713,2781.507,I do not think they can Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.345,2787.546,"You mean they have the power, you think as a matter of politics they could not, is that it?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2787.546,2796.284,"Yes, they try to put on a moratorium on this enormous fee for five months and they could not override a veto."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.377,2851.099,"Mr. Dondis, perhaps the answer is in the paper."
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2855.447,2857.69,"Well, I think it would have to be refunded?"
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.69,2860.239,To whom?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2860.239,2861.482,To those who paid it.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2886.938,2891.961,May I come back to your discussion of what might happen in Congress?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2900.366,2904.844,I do not ask the Court quite to get to that problem.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2919.516,2930.19,"Before we get to standards, I am interested in the power of Congress and what do you think Congress has intended here?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2942.481,2944.297,Oh! That is quite easy.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2944.297,2945.769,That is bearing upon your argument?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,2945.769,2947.802,That is quite easy and there are two reasons.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3049.864,3057.117,But do you draw any distinction in principle between the fees imposed in 1973 and those imposed in 1975?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3057.117,3061.41,"They were very, very minor as originally --"
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3061.41,3063.607,"From principle, is that the same?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3063.607,3069.075,"In principle, they are the same, but I would for example point to my own experience."
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3084.075,3089.856,Do you not think the Congress was aware that these 1973 fees were in effect?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3089.856,3094.978,I think they were generally aware and not greatly considering about the whole problem.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3099.076,3109.747,So do you think the Congress had been aware that the President would have set the power perhaps the increase amount of the fee?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3109.747,3115.925,"Well, it happened very suddenly in the early 1974 and Congress was very shocked by it."
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3115.925,3119.084,So you just think the Congress really did not know what it was doing?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3119.084,3120.476,I am sorry.
1975.75-382,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3120.476,3127.171,"Well, the question is not very helpful, you can forget it.[Laughter]"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3127.171,3131.035,I do not think Congress was aware of it.
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3281.623,3289.539,"You cite anymore here than whether he has exercised here, the power is valid?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3289.539,3301.934,"I think you have to decide -- well, what I am trying to say Your Honor is that this General Clause does not mean much such action as he deems necessary."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.048,3379.016,"Does the change in import even though it is indirect, nevertheless an adjustment in an import?"
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3379.016,3389.975,"I think it is a change, but I do not call it an adjustment because the word “adjust” is a verb and I think it implies something definite and certain."
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.118,3410.01,Do you take the position that the license fees will have an impact or no impact on the level of --
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3410.01,3411.779,A very uncertain impact.
1975.75-382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.297,3418.268,It is certain as to whether it has any impact at all or just uncertain as to amount?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3418.268,3424.078,"Yes, uncertain as to amount and even in some situation as to whether have any impact at all."
1975.75-382,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3432.184,3436.844,Do you think the demand is probably inelastic?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3436.844,3437.743,That is right.
1975.75-382,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3447.058,3451.03,You think it is absolutely inelastic?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3451.03,3454.594,In this situation I think it is Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.594,3461.604,(Inaudible) The purpose of the fee may have been to raise the price?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3461.604,3462.27,That is right.
1975.75-382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.88,3488.297,It may be that the domestic price of oil would encourage domestic production?
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3488.297,3490.972,"Yes, but it is the most indirect method."
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.668,3503.421,But the Congress did not do it.
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3510.583,3512.432,Not under this statute Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3513.108,3515.953,"-- several other things, but he elected to do this one."
1975.75-382,2,26860,harold_b_dondis,,3518.331,3519.257,Thank you Your Honor.
1975.75-382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3519.257,3524.697,Do you have anything further Mr. Solicitor General?
1975.75-382,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3524.697,3526.409,Just a few matters Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-382,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.446,3588.373,"Mr. Solicitor General, you probably have said in your brief or in your argument and I thought that, what do you think is the basic purpose of the fees?"
1975.75-382,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3588.373,3601.863,"The fees Mr. Justice White was to have a method of providing, cutting down foreign imports and developing American production which would provide a known market."
1975.75-382,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.863,3612.312,"Main purpose as to when -- certainly to whatever impact it might have had to limit imports that was part of the purpose, I take it?"
1975.75-382,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3612.312,3617.596,It was to limit imports to decrease American dependence for the national security reasons on foreign oil.
1975.75-382,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.596,3624.039,So they wanted to raise the price and encourage domestic production among other things?
1975.75-382,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3624.039,3624.607,That is correct.
1975.75-382,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.251,3681.167,Thank you gentlemen.
