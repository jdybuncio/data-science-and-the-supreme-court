2017.16-1220,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.03,7.805,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1220, Animal Science Products versus Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical. Mr. Gottlieb."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,7.805,54.615,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether a district court is bound to accept a foreign sovereign's statement of foreign law in the unusual case in which the court has concerns about the statement's clarity, its completeness, or its consistency. The answer to that question is no. District courts have the authority to resolve their concerns by considering any relevant materials, even if they go beyond the materials presented by the sovereign. On the motion to dismiss in this case, the district court found that the amicus brief that was submitted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce failed to answer important questions about how its Vitamin C regulations applied to the specific agreements that were identified in the complaint."
2017.16-1220,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.77,117.695,"May I ask you a question about your bottom line? You -- you say that the court of appeals should be reversed, but if you're right, that the court of appeals should not have taken what the Chinese Ministry said as conclusive, then wouldn't the proper bottom line be a vacate and remand so the Second Circuit can reassess, with the understanding that what the Ministry said is not conclusive?"
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,117.695,121.72,We do think that vacating and remanding would be an appropriate disposition.
2017.16-1220,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,221.8,229.76,"But, counsel, we actually do outsource saying what the law is sometimes in domestic law; Chevron, for example."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,242.7,258.0,"There's a number of reasons, the -- the first of which is that the Chevron doctrine has a number of sort of gatekeeping steps or preconditions before this Court would even consider the reasonableness of an agency's interpretation. And so, for example, Chevron step zero and step one --"
2017.16-1220,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,258.0,262.05,All that -- all that suggests is perhaps we -- we should import a similar regime here.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,262.05,265.12,"That would be quite a holding of this Court, Justice Gorsuch."
2017.16-1220,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,276.12,285.6,Suppose -- suppose a court said that a decision of the Supreme Court of England must be followed -- must be accepted as the law of England.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,285.6,292.29,"In that circumstance, Justice Kennedy, you would have, essentially, law that was before the interpreting court."
2017.16-1220,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.9,304.29,"Well, and as Justice -- Justice Gorsuch's question indicates, we always accept the law of the state supreme court as being the law of the state."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,304.29,312.76,"Justice Kennedy, this Court does not always accept that law. Generally, it defers to the -- the interpretation of the highest state court, but there are exceptions to that; for example --"
2017.16-1220,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.76,316.77,But it doesn't take their view of what the attorney general of the state says is the law.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,316.77,318.19,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-1220,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.19,318.6,That's --
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,318.6,341.79,"The -- the highest ranking law enforcement officer of a state would not receive binding or conclusive deference on its interpretation of -- of its state law. But, importantly, Justice Kennedy, with respect to the question of a foreign court, even if presented with an opinion of a foreign nation's highest court, the task for the United States court would still remain to determine is that -- is that opinion or is that precedent binding on the question that is before me."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,341.79,342.5,"Fine, fine."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,379.68,387.17,"The first formulation of that standard that you described, Justice Breyer, is the substantial deference standard, which is what the district court applied in this case."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,391.14,411.48,"So what you want us to do is to say you used the term ""defer to a reasonable interpretation"" and you should have used the term ""we give respectful deference to."" And for that reason, we would like you to reconsider the whole thing. Now I -- I -- I see that."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,420.995,425.75,"Justice Breyer, if that were our position, I would expect people to smile, but that is not our position."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.75,425.96,No.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,426.67,433.47,Our position is that the standard that the court of appeals applied was not a defer -- if the substance of the opinion is reasonable standard.
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.74,465.95,All right.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,554.00999995,562.95,"So, on the merits of that question, Justice Breyer, the first thing I would point out is that the Ministry's interpretation of its regulations has not been consistent through this case."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,594.65,597.32,"That isn't my question there, on that part."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,614.79,616.05,"Absolutely, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,616.05,616.22,What?
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,616.22,625.24,"There are -- we have documents in the case repeatedly demonstrating that Chinese exporters did, in fact, sell their products in the United States at lower than the $3.35 price point."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.24,625.85,All right.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,632.94,676.895,"With respect to that, Justice Breyer, we also have documents from the Chamber, one of which is cited at pages 398 to 400 of the Joint Appendix, showing that at certain times during this case the Ministry of Commerce did not list -- the Ministry or the Chamber did not list an export price for Vitamin C. And we have documents as well that are in the record demonstrating that the Chamber understood this and the participants in the system understood this, that for certain time periods during the case, because the businesses could not get together and agree upon a set export price, they allowed the businesses to export without a -- a set or mandatory export price. And -- and again, that's pages 397 to 400 of the Joint Appendix, as well -- as well as other authorities that we've cited in our reply brief and our opening brief."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.42,720.76,We're not.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,731.725,736.97,"Justice Breyer, I don't think that that is the lesson of Pink, if that's -- if that's what your question is."
2017.16-1220,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.38,737.58,"Well, fine."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,751.905,755.22,"Well, on the merits, I think I've just described why the position is wrong."
2017.16-1220,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.91,886.405,"There was no suggestion in Pink that there was any inconsistency in the position that the Soviet Union was taking, and here we do have a suggestion of inconsistency?"
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,886.405,887.15,That's correct.
2017.16-1220,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,926.87,933.735,"Mr. Gottlieb, could you state -- I read some words in the opinion below that gave me pause."
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,971.29,987.25,"We think the Court erred in saying that the district court was bound to defer, particularly at the motion to dismiss stage, when it had not yet reached a construction of -- of Chinese law. We think the court of appeals erred in its reference to a sworn evidentiary proffer. There was no sworn evidentiary proffer in this case."
2017.16-1220,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,997.47,997.68,All right.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,1047.96,1049.24,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.16-1220,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.24,1049.54,All right.
2017.16-1220,0,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,1056.985,1082.0,"Well, so, Justice Sotomayor, the court would also have to determine whether the supreme -- whether that highest court's opinion is dispositive of the question presented, whether it actually speaks to the question that's before the United States court. And imagine that that same court received a -- a -- a later decided opinion from that same foreign highest court that appeared to directly contradict the opinion that was put forward by the foreign sovereign interpreting it."
2017.16-1220,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.56,1102.345,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1102.345,1110.15,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could start with Justice Sotomayor's question to my colleague about where the Second Circuit went wrong."
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.63,1227.04,All right.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1232.69,1232.985,Yes.
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.985,1234.105,"Okay, fine."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1237.36,1237.79,Yes.
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.79,1239.375,A hundred ninety-two countries.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1271.23,1271.78,So I --
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.78,1277.005,"And I don't know if ""defer if it's reasonable."" Reasonable seems to open it."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1292.26,1320.89,"So, first, just to close out the point I was speaking to earlier, I think the words that you should write to fix the first error that I was focused on there, about the universe of materials, is that when it gets one of these submissions, a federal court is never required -- required to close its eyes to other materials that it believes bear on the question; that applying whatever standard you decide is the right form of words, the federal court gets to apply that standard with the benefit of all of the evidence that it believes is relevant, including, for example, other representations by the foreign sovereign in other fora. Now, on the question --"
2017.16-1220,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1320.89,1325.035,Is that -- would that include here the representation to the World Trade Organization?
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1325.035,1327.91,That -- the district court did believe that was important here.
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.94,1412.16500005,"So, if it's not supposed to be that, and we're not supposed to tell them, what is it we're supposed to say? And if you say open the door, maybe we could say, of course, do whatever the State Department tells you."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1419.71,1420.76,I certainly think --
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.76,1421.17,"I mean, what?"
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1421.17,1426.06,"-- anytime, if the State Department appears in the case, that's going to be relevant and we hope that the courts would take that into account."
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.06,1433.045,"There is, of course, the risk that the State Department will say thing A when it's country A and B when it's country B."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1433.045,1435.44,"Well, and also the State Department may not be there."
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1443.94,1448.31,"What about saying when in doubt you can ask the State Department, see what they think."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1448.31,1449.04,I mean --
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.04,1450.74,Take it into account for what it's worth.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1450.74,1450.98,Sure.
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.85,1463.755,"You're seriously saying what you want us to say is say nothing? Say nothing about what the standard is, nothing other than some general word like ""respectful deference""? Should we say that?"
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1463.755,1465.11,I think -- I would separate out two things.
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1484.61,1500.615,"Suppose there's a case where there's an issue of foreign law, there's also an issue of -- of U.S. law in a U.S. court, and the court receives a submission from the ministry of commerce from the foreign country and also a brief submitted by the United States on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1502.84,1503.795,No.
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1514.82,1519.35,"Well, it's a brief submitted -- it's a brief submitted by the Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Commerce."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1527.99,1528.93,I don't think so.
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1529.45,1529.97,Why not?
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1529.97,1531.73,Both of them are entitled to respect.
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1567.4,1573.12,"I -- I'm curious. So -- so federal agencies get deference, but foreign countries don't."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1588.085,1589.96,Only when Chevron deference would apply --
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1589.96,1590.2,So it does?
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1590.2,1590.62,-- under American law.
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1590.62,1591.22,So it does?
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1591.22,1592.66,When Chevron deference would apply under American law.
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1592.66,1597.66,"Yeah, so it says that foreign courts must defer to administrative agency interpretations --"
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1597.66,1598.28,When American law --
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1598.28,1598.91,-- in the United States.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1598.91,1600.39,When American law assigns them that weight.
2017.16-1220,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1611.15,1612.05,You'd argue the same thing here?
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1612.05,1612.19,No.
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1630.0,1631.5,"Well, let me reformulate my question."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1655.385,1658.56,"I'm -- I'm sorry, treated the same way in the United States? Would they get --"
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.56,1658.65,Yes.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1658.65,1659.06,Would they get --
2017.16-1220,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1659.06,1659.18,Yeah.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1666.595,1667.5,Potentially yes.
2017.16-1220,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.75,1695.09,"Well, when --"
2017.16-1220,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.09,1698.49,Suppose you have two -- two questions -- two different cases.
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1719.65,1743.48,"I guess it depends. And I -- I know that's not a helpful answer to give, but I think it's going to depend on the circumstances, particularly if it's restatement-type common law and the relevant government agency doesn't have any authority to interpret common law, that would be decided solely by the foreign courts, that would cut against deference, and, you know, if, in contrast, the agency was saying it's our regulations that require the compulsion, that would counsel in favor of deference, but there would be lots of other considerations."
2017.16-1220,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.21,1746.02,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-1220,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1746.02,1749.66500005,Thank you.
2017.16-1220,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1749.66500005,1753.53,Mr. Phillips.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1753.53,1784.99,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And maybe I -- may I begin by expressing the thanks of the Ministry of Commerce -- Commerce for allowing me to participate in the oral argument today. At some point, I'd like to get to somewhat higher level, but I want to start off with a couple of points that it seems my colleagues made that -- that warrant correction at this stage. First of all, Mr. Gottlieb suggested that the kind of program, Justice Breyer, that you described, the -- the price verification and chop, didn't actually operate that way, that there was some gap, and he cited a couple of pages in the Joint Appendix."
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.7,1854.22,"What do you do with the representation of China to the World Trade Organization that it had given up export administration of Vitamin C in 2001 and that it was a matter of voluntary agreement, with no coercion on the part of the government, with no government intervention? That -- that was a statement made by China to the World Trade Organization."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1857.86,1892.73,"I would -- I would take probably three positions with respect to that. First, it seems to me the right answer for that problem is, if the government's got a problem with it, take it up with the World Trade Organization and -- and let that organization deal with those issues. And, indeed, it's interesting that the United States, of course, quotes our briefs filed in the district court before the WTO in suggesting that we had violated our obligations under the WTO. So it seems to me the answer is not give less deference to what a foreign government says to a federal court, but, rather, if there's a concern, deal with the concern directly with the --"
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.73,1901.515,"But it isn't -- it's inconsistent to say the government compels us, that -- yes, our government compels this action by private actors --"
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1901.515,1901.7,Right.
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.7,1906.76,"-- and telling another agency, no, our government doesn't interfere."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1910.42,1910.77,Right.
2017.16-1220,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1979.73,1980.39,"Mr. Phillips, what if --"
2017.16-1220,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1980.39,1980.86,Your argument --
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1980.86,1981.785,-- throughout the entirety of this case.
2017.16-1220,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1982.39,2000.12,"Your position is that you should not have to make that argument, right? Your position is it doesn't matter what the WTO is, you look at the brief from the Ministry and that's it. So the sort of argument you were just making, which is a typical legal argument in American courts, you say is one that is inappropriate under your position."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2000.12,2002.235,I -- I think that's what this Court said in Pink.
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2032.0,2047.99,What about the -- the -- being informed by the United States that the United States itself does not urge before foreign tribunals that the foreign tribunal is bound to accept what the U.S. government says is U.S. law?
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2047.99,2048.56,"Well, I --"
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2048.56,2051.5,"We don't -- we don't demand that, and we don't get it."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2051.5,2053.2,"Well, I don't know about the don't get it."
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.52,2054.64,"But, again, respect focuses --"
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2054.64,2060.12,-- I didn't read a single instance in which the United States said this is our law and -- and the court didn't abide by it.
2017.16-1220,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.89,2131.64,"Well, what should we say in general? I just want you to reach that, because I can see three possible things."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2146.74,2147.34,No.
2017.16-1220,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.34,2147.76,Okay.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2183.45,2205.89,"Well, no, Justice Breyer, I'm actually -- I have the same concern about the words, because the truth is, if you quote the language of the Second Circuit, which you quoted, I won't go through it, but, you know, where it talks about which is reasonable under the circumstances presented, in the context of having had all of the circumstances presented to it, I don't know how this Court's going to improve on that particular language, which -- which does force me, and I -- I want to come back to the Chevron --"
2017.16-1220,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.89,2207.16,We have very good authorities.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2220.76,2221.98,"I -- I hear you, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-1220,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.03,2240.05,"So the words, to get back to the question, the words you want us to put in the opinion, at least in respect to the highest or near highest authority or -- or -- or -- or are what?"
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2240.05,2257.66,"Personally, I'd go back to Pink and I would -- or the variation of Pink that the Solicitor General adopted in 1984, which says that you should give a conclusive determine -- conclusive -- it should be a conclusive determination, unless there is an ambiguity, unless it's incredible on its face, et cetera."
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.66,2258.1,Mr. Phillips --
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2258.1,2259.71,That's the standard that I think you ought to apply.
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2259.71,2261.94,-- do -- do -- do China's courts use that rule?
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2261.94,2263.67,In -- in dealing with
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2263.67,2265.59999995,In dealing with foreign entities.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2265.59999995,2266.4,Yes.
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2269.985,2270.33,"No, no, no."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2277.395,2281.98,I -- I don't have any Chinese -- I looked for Chinese law on this particular question.
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2283.4,2290.93,We do have -- we have the European Convention as a model of what other countries do.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2305.83,2307.215,Right.
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.555,2317.04,Is there -- is there any --
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2317.04,2318.23,"If it does those things, then it should bind."
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2318.23,2322.05,Is there any country that you can identify that uses that rule?
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2322.05,2325.34,"Well, the United States up until this case."
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2325.34,2325.6,Yes.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2333.23,2337.24,"I -- I don't know of any specifically, but I don't know that any rejects it either, Justice Kagan."
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.24,2337.65,"Well, it's -- if you --"
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2337.65,2346.565,"I mean, it seems as though if -- if some country used that rule, you're a great lawyer, you would be able to tell us that some country used that rule."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2346.565,2352.48,"Well, candidly, I didn't go searching all of the countries to figure out whether or not other countries use that rule."
2017.16-1220,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.105,2388.67,"But it does seem that the European Convention that I mentioned and the similar provision in the Organization of American States, that you -- you ask the country, you want to know what their law is, they tell you; you give it respectful consideration, but it doesn't bind your -- you to follow, inevitably that you must follow, what the country tells you is its law."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2393.47,2430.83,"But, see, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there's an inconsistency between what the Second Circuit did and what you described there, because, first of all, in -- in -- in response to the Solicitor General's position that the court of appeals restrained its review of the appropriate materials, I mean, the -- the court specifically said, in determining foreign law, we may consider any relevant material or source, including the legal authorities supplied by the parties, as well as those authorities presented to the district court below, which, again, if you're trying to figure out how you're going to write an opinion, Justice Breyer, you cannot write an opinion in this case that says, well, you've got to do something different than that."
2017.16-1220,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.02,2433.73,You don't see a difference --
2017.16-1220,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2433.73,2439.335,I'm not sure that the Pink case stands for the proposition that you assert.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2474.25,2505.75,"Well, except that in the context of the case where the previous litigation had, in fact, decided exactly the opposite and the Court acknowledged that there was voluminous -- a voluminous record which suggests that there was a very significant argument that there was an extraterritorial effect, all the Court had before it that -- that it relied upon was a statement of the highest Ministry, this is the Ministry of Justice, just -- the same as the Ministry of Commerce here, to interpret that particular provision saying it has extraterritorial effect."
2017.16-1220,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.03,2523.535,"Well, I'll look at it again, but it says the referee in the Moscow case found and the evidence supported his finding that the Commissariat for Justice had the power to interpret existing Russian law. In other words, the Court is looking at what the expert evidence was and found it -- and found it reliable."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2523.535,2523.94,Right.
2017.16-1220,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.4,2540.81,Mr. Phillips --
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2540.81,2542.4,"-- in this particular case, Justice Kennedy."
2017.16-1220,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2542.4,2561.965,"-- here are two -- here are two possibilities: One is the Court says we will give respectful consideration to the submission, but in the end, we will decide what the law is. The other is we will consider -- we will determine whether the submission is reasonable, and if it is reasonable, we will regard it as conclusive."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2563.905,2567.14,"I -- I don't think so, because I --"
2017.16-1220,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2567.14,2569.75,Isn't the second what the Second Circuit said?
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2569.75,2584.225,"Yes, that's exactly what the Second Circuit said, but -- and -- and the reason why the Second Circuit's position is important and should be upheld is that there are two purposes for this kind of deference to foreign governments. One is we should get it right."
2017.16-1220,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2631.65,2648.665,"But how -- how can you say that the only thing that shows respect to foreign governments is to do something that we don't know that any other foreign nation does? I mean, presumably, all these foreign nations are doing something more like Justice Alito's first option, which is giving respectful consideration."
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2653.45,2666.0,"I -- I -- I think the answer to that question is, one, we don't know what the entirety is -- is out there that -- that describes how other courts respond."
2017.16-1220,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2672.425,2672.85,Briefly.
2017.16-1220,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2672.85,2675.33,That is as -- is as litigious as this one.
2017.16-1220,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.41,2695.27,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jacobson."
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2695.27,2726.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the best case to start the deference inquiry in this case is by recognizing that the only way the 2002 regulation makes sense is under the Ministry's interpretation. Under the regulations, price fixing was clearly required under the 2002 regime. And the -- those regulations make no sense at all under the construction offered by the Petitioners in the district court."
2017.16-1220,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2726.31,2753.815,"Doesn't that go to the merits of the issue here? That I -- I don't know that it answers the legal question we're looking at, which is the court below didn't go through the body of evidence that Rule 44.1 permits and say there's some contradictory evidence, but it doesn't make sense in light of the minister's explanation."
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2753.815,2755.255,Justice --
2017.16-1220,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2755.255,2758.025,Isn't that what the Second Circuit should have done?
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2758.025,2758.62,Justice --
2017.16-1220,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.62,2767.735,What it did was look at the minister's explanation without addressing any potential conflicting evidence and saying it really doesn't conflict.
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2767.735,2787.625,"So -- so, Justice Sotomayor, I think if you look at pages 9a and 27 to 28a of the opinion, you'll see that what the Second Circuit did is it looked at the text of the 2002 regulation, said that appears to require price fixing, but there are some ambiguous terms."
2017.16-1220,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2798.6,2802.965,What about in the district court? There were -- it was a long opinion.
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2828.995,2832.45,"I -- I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2017.16-1220,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.01,2899.515,"That's the -- do we draw that distinction, the formal submission of a foreign sovereign? The reason I ask that is -- you practice in this area, right?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2899.515,2900.175,I do.
2017.16-1220,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.175,2900.68,All right.
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2959.54,2966.78,So this Court has received amicus submissions by foreign governments in numerous cases.
2017.16-1220,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2968.55,2969.65,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right."
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,2969.65,2982.87,And -- and this Court has always recognized that the foreign government's statements in those briefs about its own laws should be controlling. So the Intel case was raised.
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3013.455,3043.165,"What if the entity that submits the brief on behalf of the foreign country does not have the authority under the law of that country to dictate what the law is? What if the entity is like the executive branch of the government of the United States, which does not have the authority to dictate what the law is? It -- it can express an opinion, and that's generally -- it's very often correct and it's entitled to respectful consideration."
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3043.165,3048.19,"I -- I think, in that instance, respectful deference is an appropriate standard."
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3049.73,3051.565,"Well, why is it not this case?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3051.565,3058.38,"Because MOFCOM creates the regulations, interprets the regulations, and enforces the regulations."
2017.16-1220,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.34,3088.19,I -- I have -- I don't understand this constant emphasis on respectful.
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3098.735,3104.33,"Respectfully, Your Honor -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3104.33,3132.865,"So -- so I believe, when a foreign government comes in with an official statement of its own laws, respectful deference is not a sufficient standard. The deference standard should be -- and -- and, Justice Breyer, this goes to the question that you've been asking throughout -- I think, if you look at the first paragraph on page 23 of the Solicitor General's brief in the Matsushita case, that is the correct standard to apply here."
2017.16-1220,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3132.865,3151.83,"So, just to be clear, respectful really plays no role, right? I mean, if you wanted to say -- to the government and say, well, all right, I guess you're right, I guess I have to defer to this, you might say that's disrespectful, but that's all that matters, right, whether you're going to -- and by ""defer,"" you mean accept, whether you're going to accept the proposition or not, right?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3151.83,3152.08,Yes.
2017.16-1220,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.08,3153.785,It's not enough to be respectful.
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3153.785,3155.895,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-1220,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3155.895,3156.27,Okay.
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3156.27,3177.23,"I -- I thought you just told me that if the entity that submitted the brief on behalf of the foreign country does not have the authority to dictate foreign law, then all it should get is respectful consideration but that this case is different. But then you seem to have turned around and said no, the rule across the board is that you follow what the foreign government submits. So which is it?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3177.23,3186.18,So I -- I'm equating the foreign government with the entity that has the authority to interpret law under those circumstances.
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3186.18,3190.41499995,Could this issue ever come up in China -- in the Chinese courts?
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3190.41499995,3194.19,I suspect so.
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3208.92,3214.915,"I don't understand enough about the Chinese legal system, but could this come before the Supreme People's Court?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3214.915,3225.23,"Well, in -- in -- with -- without exhausting all of the myriad contexts in which it might arise, hypothetically, I would think so."
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3225.23,3230.05,"And would they just say, okay, this is what the Ministry of Commerce says; that's the end of the matter?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3230.05,3231.88,"Yes, absolutely."
2017.16-1220,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.88,3233.85,And can you point to something that shows that?
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3233.85,3240.64,It's the -- the principle that the rule-maker has the authority to interpret its own rules.
2017.16-1220,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3240.7,3252.09,"Does the Supreme People's Court deal with cases like this? Isn't it true that, in most commercial matters, the courts are not used but arbitrators are?"
2017.16-1220,3,62985,jonathan_jacobson,,3252.09,3257.355,"Justice Ginsburg, I honestly don't know the answer to -- to that question."
2017.16-1220,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.85,3506.86499995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gottlieb, two minutes."
2017.16-1220,4,62984,michael_j_gottlieb,,3506.86499995,3538.845,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start with a question that Justice Kagan asked, which was the question about whether Chinese courts would -- would provide this kind of deference. There's no indication that Chinese courts would provide a rule of binding deference, and their amicus brief that they have from Chinese scholars on this precise question doesn't make that argument. The importance of this point is it shows that the rule for which the Ministry is advocating here and which Respondents are advocating would place the United States alone in the world. China doesn't apply this kind of binding deference."
2017.16-1220,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3630.39,3631.325,"Thank you, counsel."
