1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3179.374,3180.32,That would be an offense under paragraph (a).
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3180.32,3184.568,But he'd also be guilty since he used the gun on paragraph (d).

1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3223.321,3240.978,"-- you see what I'm trying to get at, if -- if that's right, then under the first paragraph of now paragraph (a) of 2113, in the situation I put to you, that would be an offense while an offense under that paragraph and also under (d) would be only one offense."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3240.978,3241.585,That's right.
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3241.585,3251.956,"Why is it that we have two offenses where it's an entry and causing the question, the second paragraph of paragraph (a) of 2113?"
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3252.62,3258.793,Because the arrangements here can be understood only in relation to the history of the --
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3258.793,3260.858,"Well, I certainly agree with that."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3260.858,3262.715,Only in relation to the history of the statute.
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3268.615,3270.264,"Well, I know your arguments, no needn't repeat it."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3271.654,3271.659,All right.
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3271.659,3282.6,"-- your answer to me is that that first paragraph of paragraph (a) came in, in 1934 and the second paragraph for very different purpose in 1947."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3282.6,3283.594,1937.
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3283.594,3284.418,1937.
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3284.418,3299.072,"And then when -- but it had been in existence from -- what happened is that when the statute, read (a) and (b), when the Attorney General then said to Congress, “You made a mistake in admitting the larceny and burglary provisions.”"
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3423.028,3431.829,"Now, Ms. Rosenberg, that means I gather that in the case I put to you, the -- the employee come to work in the morning intending to do what he finally did in the -- in the end of the day."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3434.738,3434.744,If he --
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3434.744,3436.442,That's two sentences.
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3436.442,3438.381,"Well, there'd be question of when the intent occurred."
1956.132,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.873,3448.245,"Well, I'm assuming he enters, he attempted to enter when he came to work in the morning and his intention when he entered that morning was that he was going to rob the bank during the day with a gun and he did."
1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3455.467,3455.974,Yes.

1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3460.213,3462.163,That's right.
1956.132,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3480.36,3492.208,"Ms. Rosenberg, suppose a man went into the bank two or three times with the idea of robbing it when -- when the time was propitious and he have cashed a check and he say, “Well, this isn't the time.”"

1956.132,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3516.153,3520.674,"-- allows Congress defined it, congress defined it as entry."
1956.132,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3575.379,3576.238,Thank you.
1956.132,2,31112,joseph_p_jenkins,,3577.225,3578.554,"One minute, yes, Your Honor."
