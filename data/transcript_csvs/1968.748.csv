1968.748,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.116,-- 8 Thornton A. Jenkins petitioner versus Delaware.
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,11.577,15.135,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,853.455,858.017,"She was the, at least the nominal lessee, as I remember."
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,858.017,863.514,"The testimony of the landlord says that as far as he was concerned, she was the only tenant of the property."
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.352,881.394,Was the search point raised in the second appeal?
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,881.394,882.34,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.023,887.718,"Now why does the opinion left to deal with, don't you think?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,887.718,903.999,"Yes Your Honor, it does in the -- it points out that the petitioner raises for the record the same issues at pages 101 and 102 --"
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,903.999,904.958,For record purposes.
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,904.958,906.003,-- record purposes.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1217.693,1239.777,"Well, assuming that Ms. Marshall's consent was valid and effective, if the police had entered the premises and had found things there connecting her with the crime, she had later been indicted, you wouldn't have any question about the use of that would you, against her?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1239.777,1240.67,Against her.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1241.928,1244.73,"What precisely, what is the complaint here?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1261.889,1263.135,"It was an entire house, Your Honor."
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1263.135,1277.075,"It's an entire house and she was the tenant although petitioner paid the rent, but she was the tenant and the police wanted to search the entire house."
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1282.943,1283.722,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1283.722,1298.081,Was that in any thing identifiable or identified or identifiable as petitioner separate and private receptacle such as a locked suitcase?
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1298.081,1299.098,"No, it was not Your Honor."
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1302.14,1302.368,"Well, what you're really --"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1302.368,1307.745,-- both the junk and the jacket which were clothing were in commonly occupied areas.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1307.745,1339.122,"Alright, what you're really saying, if I correctly understand it, is that apart from the question of the validity of her consent, assuming that her consent was valid that the police would then be -- were then warranted and searching the premises, but they were not warranted in using the fruits of that search against petitioner, is that it?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1339.122,1340.612,That is correct Your Honor.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1340.612,1355.69,"An alternative would be to argue that the obtaining of her consent was not valid because she was really the target of the search, you're not arguing that are you?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1355.69,1356.876,"Well, I am arguing that."
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1357.762,1359.858,Was there any authority for that?
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1359.858,1370.457,I'm arguing that that is what makes the search unreasonable if the standard applicable and I concede to not knowing what the standard is.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1387.75,1388.409,Well of course --
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1388.409,1389.128,-- the consenter.
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1389.128,1412.29,"-- what you're advocating, if I understand you, is a very noble doctrine and that is that the consent has to be obtained not from the person having some sort of possessory or ownership rights, but from the person who is the target of the search."
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1453.403,1457.426,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I wouldn't go that far and do not need to in this case."
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1478.09,1482.21,"Now, there's no -- nothing in our books to that effect, is there?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1482.21,1483.216,There is none
1968.748,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1483.216,1485.269,This is what would be a new doctrine?
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1485.269,1486.754,That is correct.
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.754,1492.671,What -- you say that the police were rightfully in the house.
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1500.427,1508.978,"I think my answer was to the question that if she was consented to a search, then a search to obtain evidence against was proper."
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.673,1525.481,"Now let's assume that while they're properly in the house, they see some narcotics in the mantle piece, and they say “whose narcotics are those?”"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1537.482,1540.763,I say no.
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.763,1544.296,"Well, you not only want new doctrine, you want some reversal to some old then?"
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1544.296,1545.494,I think that's correct.
1968.748,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.494,1551.376,Yes.
1968.748,0,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,1551.376,1555.867,No further question that concludes my argument.
1968.748,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1555.867,1558.475,Mr. Conner.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1558.475,1562.928,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1650.122,1656.467,"Mr. Conner, suppose in this case happened in '64?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1656.467,1665.1,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the date of confession was March 17, '65, first trial January '66."
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.1,1682.537,"Well, suppose this man had been in the federal penitentiary and didn't get out until '67 and was tried in '67, would the rule apply?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1682.537,1684.321,Would the Johnson rule apply?
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.591,1703.195,"Well, that's -- now suppose at the end of this trial, the judge had decided to give him a new trial, would the rule apply?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1703.195,1707.445,"Then well, under that hypothetical, when was the first trial?"
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.445,1714.259,"The first trial was in '65, and the granted a new trial in '67."
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1714.259,1716.431,The rule would not apply sir.
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.431,1719.683,What's the difference between those and this one?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1719.683,1724.785,"Well, there are several differences."
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1727.53,1735.963,"You know, usually when you distinguish a case, you sometimes just only thing distinguishes the name."
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1743.149,1748.254,It's our -- it's our position that a retrial is not a new trial.
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.895,1786.59,"So, your point is, this is the same trial?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1786.59,1788.614,This is the same trial and as part of the case.
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.614,1795.8,"It's a different judge, a different jury, different everything it was the same trial?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,1795.8,1798.91,"It is an extension of the same trial, yes sir."
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.959,1997.339,"Mr. Conner, I hate to stick to my point but it seems to me your court said on page 56 “According to the his opinion of the court, the Jenkins conviction of murder of in the first degree, it must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.”"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2000.676,2007.67,"Well, that's language used in that decision, yes sir Mr. Justice Marshall, but when you look at really what --"
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.67,2010.292,It's not binding on you?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2014.412,2015.486,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.324,2022.703,But they did say new trial.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2022.703,2025.229,They did say new trial.
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2308.501,2320.571,Is that really true that all the police are required to do is to go out and get the bare amount that they think is sufficient to sustain a conviction?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2331.996,2332.894,Absolutely.
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2333.421,2336.446,"Well, I thought that -- I didn't understand you to say that was --"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2336.446,2342.023,I may have misinterpreted my -- I may have not communicated in my remarks properly.
1968.748,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2464.86,2480.13,Was the Dorothy in the California Supreme Court decided before or after this Court's decision in Stolov?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2480.13,2490.586,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I'm not quite sure of the Dorothy date."
1968.748,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2490.586,2497.256,"I haven't read all these cases in your, or really any of these cases in your footnotes 10, 11 and 12."
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2522.559,2522.919,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.163,2534.786,Also in '67 my recollection is.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2534.786,2542.635,"Now, it's very possible that Dorothy was actually argued and considered prior to June and even though the written opinion did not come out for some time."
1968.748,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.635,2552.128,"You don't remember whether the California Supreme Court discusses the Stovol case in its opinion I think it add the date in the Stovol decision, but that's not what --"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2552.128,2564.216,"That is my recollection also, and my next point which was I going to discuss exactly was the Stovol case."
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2821.242,2824.587,Did he go that far?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2824.587,2825.009,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.829,2913.164,"Well, let's just assume that under the last example that -- that a thief lives stolen goods in the house of his girlfriend, but he just happens to leave it on the suitcase with his name on it and that sits."
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2933.383,2938.94,"Well, now I would differ there."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.743,2946.33,Why?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2948.174,2951.468,There still no -- just property is being invaded.
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.773,2959.779,Fourth Amendment protects effects as well as houses to his effects.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2973.453,2977.525,"Well, this Court -- this Court has long held that they could be seized."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.525,2981.864,"Well, on what basis?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2987.384,2988.223,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.469,2989.996,"Now, but why could they do that?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,2997.709,3009.014,"They, if the search, if the search is proper and the search is reasonable then anything in there can be seized, so it's the reason -- if we go back --"
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.014,3009.553,"Yes, but why is that?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3017.981,3022.105,"Well, because the Court has ruled that the search is the critical thing."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.644,3027.351,I thought that you said that --
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3027.351,3029.064,Not the reasonableness of the seizure.
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.064,3039.052,"I know, you've said that before but I'd like to know why it's reasonable to seize somebody's property that's protected by the Fourth Amendment without a warrant?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3039.052,3040.729,Warrants don't go to seizure.
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.172,3051.061,"Now wait a minute, the warrants always give the right seize."
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3054.055,3056.43,To look for contraband of the fruits of the crime.
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.43,3058.107,Simply look for physical evidences.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3058.275,3060.0,"They look for tangible, physical evidence."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.0,3062.503,Look for -- most of the time anyway.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3081.533,3086.365,"No, I don't go that far."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.365,3098.94,"Well, you had told me then why a policeman searching a house ought to be able seize somebody else's effects?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3120.867,3140.077,"Well, if the person that owns the effects wanted to protect his privacy interest in these effects, and goes to the trouble to, let's say enclose them and prevent them and keep them out of sight of the general public, then that privacy interest should be respected."
1968.748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.82,3159.095,"So you couldn't seize the suitcase, but you could seize the clothes in the suitcase if the suitcase was lying open?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3159.095,3160.962,"Yes, sir."
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3160.962,3175.621,"If he had hid these things that they took so that they were not immediately visible, would you say they could've gone in and taken them out then?"
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3180.998,3186.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, in this case I'm going to rest on the fact that these goods were all in the open."
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3186.914,3188.052,We have to go a little farther.
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3218.06,3222.539,"Well, I think if he takes Mr. Chief Justice, if he takes them to his own home --"
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3222.539,3223.018,Isn't this his home?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3223.018,3224.994,-- then he is seeking more privacy.
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3224.994,3227.853,Isn't this his home?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3227.853,3241.865,"Well, if -- when a man chooses to live in an extra marital relationship with another woman, he is giving away some of the privacy that he could've had by living in marriage relationship or living by himself."
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3250.362,3255.147,But it would've been alright if he'd put them on a suitcase?
1968.748,1,29809,jay_h_conner,,3255.147,3267.111,"It would be -- we would be on -- our point would not be as strong as he lays these in these in the suitcase, yes sir."
1968.748,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3325.89,3326.896,Mr. Herndon.
1968.748,2,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,3326.896,3330.284,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may respond very briefly."
1968.748,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.093,3505.021,"Well, in your -- then you would contend that to take your adversary's hypothetical case that a robber who stashed away stolen goods in an empty house in a summer resort and left, and that the owner of that house could not consent to the search of the house because the object would be to get evidence against the robber."
1968.748,2,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,3515.081,3525.56,"I have trouble with that Your Honor, and I had trouble with it because wonder whether or not the robber at that juncture had not in fact abandoned that by putting it in some -- putting it -- just dumping that property in somebody's house."
1968.748,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3525.56,3539.083,"Well, what I understood you to say just now was that somebody with a propriety interest in a house could not give consent to a search if the purpose, and object, and target of the search was to get evidence somebody else?"
1968.748,2,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,3539.083,3540.259,"Then, I would --"
1968.748,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3540.259,3541.064,Is that what you said?
1968.748,2,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,3541.064,3541.315,That's what I have said.
1968.748,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3541.315,3545.722,"Well, that would cover the summer house case, wouldn't it?"
1968.748,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3545.722,3557.567,"Mr. Herndon, the Court understands that you were appointed by the court below to represent this man as an indigent defendant and you carried the case on through this Court."
1968.748,2,27219,henry_n_herndon_jr,,3577.663,3581.794,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
