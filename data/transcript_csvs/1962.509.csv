1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,894.914,901.677,[Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,901.677,916.714,"Well, Your Honor it is in a sense a fiction, but when we look at the principle which Justice Holmes handed down, which Justice Story handed down and which Chief Justice Marshall handed down, it's more than a mere fiction."
1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,931.785,939.57,[Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,939.57,955.481,"Well, Your Honor, I think there is some analogy, but I would say when an automobile, when you're put out with an automobile from your home or some place, you come to the corner and you stop at a traffic light, you're all times under the protection of the police, you are all times subject to the jurisdiction of the community."
1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,969.291,973.371,[Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,973.371,974.391,Sometimes sir.
1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,974.391,982.485,May I ask [Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,982.485,983.53,"No, sir I do not."

1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,984.633,987.049,"I think that it was incorrectly decided, yes, Your Honor."
1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1025.059,1032.836,[Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1032.836,1034.58,"Of course, sir."
1962.509,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1077.096,1096.489,[Inaudible]
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1096.489,1106.088,"I agree that It would be more substantive, but as I said, Your Honor, while the other is a fiction, yet there is a great deal of substance too, so it's full of substance."
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.68,1148.785,"Mr. Freedmen, does the ship get the right over against the longshoremen?"
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1148.785,1153.161,"Against the bareboat charter, yes, Your Honor."
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.161,1154.773,"The ship does, not the owner?"
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1154.773,1155.983,"Well, both."
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.481,1171.48,Clearly the owner that's involved thought isn't it?
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1171.48,1172.096,Sir?
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.096,1174.752,"Clearly the owner that's involved, not the ship."
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1174.752,1176.483,"Well, sir."
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.658,1188.142,"Let's put it this way, the owner is also involved."
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1188.142,1188.996,Sir?
1962.509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.996,1191.453,"Let's put it this way, the owner is also involved."
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1191.453,1194.45,"Yes, Your Honor, I think probably that would be a more appropriate way of putting it."
1962.509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.121,1244.084,Who would pay the judgment if your riding the ship?
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1244.084,1245.001,Sir?
1962.509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1245.001,1248.104,"Ship can't make out a check to pay the judgment, can it?"
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1248.104,1248.38,The ship sir?
1962.509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1248.38,1251.737,"We are talking about people here, not."
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1251.737,1253.459,I don't quiet understand Your Honor.
1962.509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.459,1258.709,"If you're right, who would pay the judgment if you prevail?"
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1258.709,1266.279,"Well in rem action the ship itself would pay the judgment, if the money wasn't forthcoming the ship could be sold and the proceeds used to pay the judgment."
1962.509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1266.279,1268.804,That's true in any attachment case isn't it if at all?
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1268.804,1272.47,"It's true in any attachment case, yes sir, but there are differences."
1962.509,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1558.581,1560.74,You may Mr. Freedman.
1962.509,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1560.74,1563.372,Thank you sir.
1962.509,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1563.372,1568.779,Mr. Byrne.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1568.779,1573.387,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.613,1738.104,"That, is that -- is that been decided by this Court that a bareboat charter is in a liability [Inaudible] when that is arising after the charter."
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1738.104,1742.827,"Since the Barnstable case Your Honor, its cited in the briefs."
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.827,1746.886,We had a case last year Guzman against Pichirilo.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1746.886,1749.101,You did not reach this question.
1962.509,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1749.101,1749.677,Didn't reach it.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1749.677,1758.648,"No sir, in Pichirilo and Guzman, you decided on the ground that there was not a demise."
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1765.988,1775.09,"But it was indicated in that opinion that the reason was it not or was it, that we have granted certiorari in that case because we thought issue was --"
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1775.09,1781.26,Yes Your Honor that was a subject of Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent and I don't recall whether you joined in that or not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.26,1784.025,"Now, that's not important but --"
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1784.025,1786.08,But this point was reserved at that point.
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1786.08,1789.1,And it was indicated that this is the reason we've granted certiorari.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1789.1,1791.164,That was the reason you granted certiorari.
1962.509,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.164,1801.585,Which would that the implication from that would be that the -- this Court at the time at least the certiorari was granted in that case it didn't consider the question was foreclosed.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1801.585,1804.965,Perhaps I don't understand which question is foreclosed Your Honor.
1962.509,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1804.965,1809.032,The liability in this case of Waterman.
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1809.032,1818.361,"Oh, I don't think that the liability of Waterman was involved and I don't mean Waterman but I mean the owner."
1962.509,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1818.361,1820.267,"We are talking about the owner, in this case Waterman."
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1820.267,1824.99,Was involved in Pichirilo versus Guzman.

1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1969.644,1976.873,"If the Court please I am a stevedoring company, Pan-Atlantic is a stevedoring company it is also a ship owner."
1962.509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.873,1979.038,[Inaudible]
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,1979.038,1996.284,"Yes Your Honor, we are also a ship owner of other ships, we chartered this one, but as a regular part of Pan-Atlantic's operations it does its own stevedoring work, it does not use an independent stevedoring contractor, we are not in any -- by any means unique in that."
1962.509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.284,2008.776,[Inaudible]
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,2008.776,2010.742,Oh yes that's an in personam liability.

1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,2018.152,2021.523,Well under certain circumstances.
1962.509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.825,2028.181,[Inaudible]
1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,2028.181,2038.761,Well I don't see that -- yes that's in spite of the Longshoreman's Act but that's based upon a -- this Court has said that's based upon a contractual relationship which has been voluntarily entered into.
1962.509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.761,2053.636,[Inaudible]

1962.509,1,42444,t_e_byrne_jr,,2083.193,2105.545,"Yes, that is one result of my argument put that way, but I say this sir that Congress in the Longshoremen's Act has given to an employer a certain immunity if he pays and provides compensation, and that any steamship owner may that he chooses be his own stevedoring and a great many of them do."
1962.509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.545,2108.993,And thereby [Inaudible]

1962.509,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3529.881,3537.963,That maybe Mr. Freeman we have sought to interpret Section 33 namely that the ship was a third person if were to agree with you.
1962.509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3537.963,3541.925,And the third person again has the right over against the --
1962.509,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3541.925,3544.299,Yes sir no question about that in my mind.

1962.509,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3562.729,3565.91,I don't know that I need to go that far Your Honor.
1962.509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.715,3618.1,Well then they are reaching the same result to say that the owner wears two hats that of an owner and that of a stevedore.
1962.509,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3618.1,3620.281,I think that's correct your honor.
