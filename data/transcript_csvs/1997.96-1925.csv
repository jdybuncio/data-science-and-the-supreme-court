1997.96-1925,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.67,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1925, Caterpillar, Inc. v. International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America."
1997.96-1925,0,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,13.61,17.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.569,135.56,"Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Gangemi, do you think the wage payments would be lawful if the employees actually worked for the employer an hour a day and the rest of the time for the union?"
1997.96-1925,0,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,135.56,146.808,"I believe that the statute provides that an employer may pay for the services of that individual as an employee, but may not pay--"
1997.96-1925,1,21542,david_silberman,,1773.594,1783.439,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1925,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1803.254,1805.724,"Well, one principle I think has been suggested."
1997.96-1925,1,21542,david_silberman,,1880.462,1898.714,"--Well, Justice Souter, first, as a historical matter, at the time the statute was enacted there was as much evidence of no... of payment of the type we had here, where it was recognized that an employee would have full time off to perform certain union functions, representational functions, as part-time positions."
1997.96-1925,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1898.714,1899.996,Can I find that in the record?
1997.96-1925,1,21542,david_silberman,,1899.996,1901.245,You can find that in our brief.
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3028.032,3036.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1925,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.658,3084.509,"No, but they're current payments to current employees for services being performed currently, but the by-reason-of language would naturally be read to preserve the pension benefits of people who work for the union later and then get their pension benefits."
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3090.962,3096.797,"Well, Your Honor, we think that there is a three-step inquiry here that demonstrates that they are by reason of."
1997.96-1925,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3106.121,3109.905,What's the fact that it's in a collective bargaining agreement got to do with it?
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3109.905,3123.133,"Because it talks about payments for services, Your Honor, and the quintessential location where one looks in a labor environment to find out what services and payment are due is in the collective bargaining agreement."
1997.96-1925,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.785,3128.657,You don't think the statute really meant that you can get around the prohibition--
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3137.112,3140.843,"--No, we don't, Your Honor, and that is a necessary predicate."
1997.96-1925,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.126,3145.598,"--Well, it certainly has to be in the agreement."
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3145.598,3145.848,--Yes.
1997.96-1925,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.848,3147.418,But I don't know that the agreement solves anything.
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3147.418,3148.89,"Another... well, there are two."
1997.96-1925,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.421,3198.593,This only applies to grievance chairmen?
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3201.044,3204.907,"--It would be a very different inquiry in different circumstances, Your Honor."
1997.96-1925,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.35,3215.001,"Oh, but what about that, because that seems an awfully good question."
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3226.499,3226.799,Mm-hmm.
1997.96-1925,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3227.36,3228.251,"I mean, what about that?"
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3228.251,3231.844,"--We certainly think that closer inquiry would have to be looked at, Your Honor."
1997.96-1925,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3231.844,3246.935,"But when you say close inquiry, I mean, that's... then you see, that's what I'm... doesn't that make you a bit nervous that the employer is paying for someone who's spending his full time, for example, being the union's chief negotiator in the collective bargaining contract?"
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3246.935,3252.249,"Well, Your Honor, there is the section 8(a)(2) proviso that prohibits domination interference."
1997.96-1925,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3256.469,3258.382,Suppose they happen to pay a million dollars for doing it?
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3261.153,3262.795,--Those are several things... no.
1997.96-1925,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3265.998,3285.649,"--Well, if, in fact, you were to prevail here, would that reasoning that allows you to prevail also permit the employer to pay for a full-time employee who is the negotiator for the union in respect to the collective bargaining agreement?"
1997.96-1925,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3285.649,3289.953,--It's certainly one... we would be looking at that.
1997.96-1925,3,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,3654.44,3669.691,"The bottom line, both respondent and the United States conflate the concept of service with the concept of the status of a prior employee."
1997.96-1925,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3738.597,3740.079,"Thank you, Mr. Gangemi."
