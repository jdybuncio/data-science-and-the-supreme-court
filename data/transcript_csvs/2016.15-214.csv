2016.15-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.06,"We will hear argument first this morning in case 15-214, Murr v. Wisconsin. Mr. Groen."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,7.06,23.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental unfairness in this case is illustrated by one fact: If anyone else in the world, other than the Murr siblings, owned Lot E, that owner could sell or develop it."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,25.715,26.66,"Mr. Groen, may I ask --"
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,26.66,27.855,Let me ask you this question.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,58.105,62.27,They should pay for -- compensation for the taking of Lot E.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,63.04,64.26,"Which is $100,000."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,73.895,75.58,"No, I don't think so."
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.6,87.855,"The hypothetical is together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth a hundred thousand each. What is the amount that the -- the county has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,87.855,93.86,The analysis must begin with defining the relevant parcel that's the subject of the case analysis.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.86,96.16,"And in your view, that's Lot E only."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,96.16,96.89,That's right.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.89,98.97,"And they pay $100,000 only."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,99.515,106.95,The land owner would have the burden of proving that there are additional damages that they should be compensated for.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.94,109.67,You indicated there's no severance damages.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,111.815,116.29,"You're taking all of Lot E, and they should be paid compensation for Lot E."
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,116.29,116.63,That's right.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,116.63,117.58,Whether that compensation is --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,117.58,127.14,"That's $100,000 that go under your theory, land owners in the hypothetical that I put up would lose money and the State would be -- would be getting the windfall."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,127.14,135.695,If that hypothetical does not include any integrated economic use between those two parcels; that is correct.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.42,143.255,But the integrated -- the integrated use is determined by the market.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,146.685,154.63,And that is exactly what the government would argue is that the compensation must be limited to the parcel that is taken.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.5,180.945,Why isn't the value -- then why isn't that true here? Then why doesn't that defeat your theory here?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,180.945,182.895,It supports the theory.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,212.09,212.52,Mr. Groen --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,212.52,213.29,-- with a single parcel.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,213.29,221.78,-- can I ask just a clarifying question about your argument? One of the things that makes this case odd is that there are family members all around.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,254.51,258.36,"Well, I'm not sure which parcel your -- your hypothetical is talking about."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,258.36,258.65,You have --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,258.65,259.25,But -- but -- but.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,259.25,261.315,-- two preexisting substandard parcels.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,266.175,266.75,Each parcel.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,266.84,277.325,"And now the person who has bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to build on them, and your argument would be the exact same."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,277.325,278.56,That -- that's right.
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,290.63,308.135,"So where does regulatory -- a State's regulatory power come in? This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to -- to this one owner owns two parcels or two different people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one owner."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,324.195,325.15,"Well, no."
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,344.71,348.835,"But the parents -- it may have been a taking for the parents, but they never charged it."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,353.02,353.21,And --
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.21,357.415,"They could have said, no, I don't want two contiguous ones, Dad and Mom."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,361.33,370.87,"And this Court in Palazzolo v. Rhode Island ruled that the notice that the Murr children may have had -- they actually didn't know, but let's assume that they did know --"
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,370.87,371.88,They should have known.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,371.88,373.47,Let's assume that.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,389.91,390.47,But that's a very --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,390.47,391.26,-- absolved of liability.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,391.26,393.03,That's a very different situation.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,417.79,423.095,"No, I think that's not right. They have the exact same takings claim because we're talking about Parcel E."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,424.66,429.05,The parents could develop on Parcel E; the children can't.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,429.05,436.05,"The parents, if they had put it in their own common ownership, which they did for a period of time."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,446.36,451.365,"The parents -- let me try this again. For the parents, the two properties were two properties."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,457.85,465.6,"The takings claim arises because of the restrictions imposed by the government, not by change in ownership or anything like that."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,491.84,492.12,But the --
2016.15-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,492.12,492.5,"Well, then --"
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,492.5,493.695,The -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,493.695,495.35,"Please, follow up."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,495.35,514.31,"The -- the -- the regulation here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr parents and for the plumbing company was their ability to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that right?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,514.31,519.81,"Well, the parents didn't seek to combine these two lots or to sell to someone who wanted to combine the two lots."
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.59,553.5,And we're told these merger rules have a long history.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,564.44,570.88,"There -- there are lots of -- of land-use regulations of all types, including merger provisions."
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.41,613.185,Your answer to Justice Ginsburg is that all of those other State regulations are also invalid.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,613.185,614.95,No.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,627.53,642.66,"Once you determine that, then you determine, okay, under that merger law or whatever land-use ordinance, does it reach a level of magnitude of interference that there is a taking? And those would have to be -- be analyzed on the merits of their own situation."
2016.15-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,642.66,652.765,"I thought your argument was that under State law, the properties were not formally merged, that the merger was only, I think as the Court put it, an effective merger."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,652.765,653.925,That's exactly right.
2016.15-214,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,671.74,672.5,Do we know -- do we know exactly --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,672.5,673.58,They could actually still give it away.
2016.15-214,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,673.58,701.155,"I'm sorry. Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the county define ""common ownership""? For example, if one lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the siblings, would that be common ownership?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,701.155,721.91,"Under the way Wisconsin has applied common ownership, as long as they are not informally the same name -- so here William and Dorothy Murr, they fully owned their plumbing company, and so they were technically in -- in different ownership and that was enough to be in separate --"
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,721.91,722.59,Would it be enough if --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,722.59,722.69,So --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.69,726.675,"-- the husband owned one, wife owned the other? That's different? They're separate?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,726.675,732.7,"The way Wisconsin has been applying it, it would -- it would encourage that kind of manipulation and --"
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.7,732.92,What is the --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,732.92,735.2,-- and bring in the incentives.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.2,738.49,"I mean, I've not got beyond Holmes."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,748.725,749.565,Correct.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.565,750.26,All right.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,756.1,756.67,Well --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,756.67,773.52,"My problem is, I can't think of just what those lines should be, that -- that, perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many different factors. For example, in your case, I imagined that what the State was concerned about is they want to preserve a lake."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,821.88,822.53,Yes.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.23,834.42,And that's what I'm objecting to.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,834.42,835.1,-- and is it one parcel --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,835.1,841.27,"Now, see that's -- now you're not getting my question. Because my question is: Why look for that? Is it relevant? Yes."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,868.2,868.43,Well --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.43,869.74,I want your general reaction.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,869.74,883.04,"Well, the general reaction is you must begin with the approved legal lots of record that have actually been approved and that have attained -- because they are legal lots of record, they have rights that's in dispute."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,883.04,883.78,"But, Mr. Groen, one of the --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,883.78,885.17,That's what Roth is all about.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,885.17,890.025,One of the oddities of your position is that you seem to be taking half of State law.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,928.675,946.43,"In defining property interests, Roth and this Court in Lucas note 7 both recognized that you look to the State law, not to the whole body of State law, you look to the State law that governs the creation that's the legal recognition of lots and the protection of the property interest."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,946.43,948.65,"Well, I -- I think that you're right, Mr. Groen."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,964.815,965.94,There's two reasons.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,972.93,974.69,And what would it take to be formally merged?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,974.69,976.39,Elimination of lot lines.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.39,976.71,Why?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,976.71,977.81,And that has not happened.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,977.81,978.21,Because if the Court --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,978.21,979.56,Because if -- if they remain --
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.56,982.1,If the State can say we don't have to eliminate lot lines.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,986.93,994.68,"And it's only for the limited purposes of precluding sale or development. But more than that, your question comes right back."
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1015.46,1016.315,"Well, again, I think --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1016.315,1016.7,-- so now you --
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1016.7,1035.085,"-- Palazzolo depends on the buyers having the exact same takings claim as the sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this case. But let me ask you a different -- a different way around the question, which is, whether you think reasonable expectations matter at all in your framework?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1035.085,1044.595,The reasonable expectations that were addressed in Lucas footnote 7 are the expectations that grow out of the traditional understandings of property law.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.11,1057.27,Okay.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1057.27,1057.94,-- what they are relying upon.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.94,1073.995,"But here, if I'm buying property in this area, I also know that there are these rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and how it is that contiguous lots are understood for purposes of that development potential."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1115.785,1122.48,I understand the use of reasonable expectations under the Penn Central for determining whether there is a taking.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.09,1140.58,"But what about -- I -- of course, property is property."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1216.365,1217.0,No.
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.21,1242.36,May I --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1242.36,1244.01,That is what has been lost.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1244.01,1244.16,But --
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.16,1266.165,"May I ask a question? I do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case, that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to the State boundary lines, the State property lines. You say as a denominator on the takings claim, there -- it's fixed."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1305.275,1305.88,Yes.
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1305.88,1309.605,"Or is it, under every circumstance, the denominator?"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1309.605,1315.645,In -- in -- you must begin with the presumption of identifying the single parcel.
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1317.51,1317.96,What over --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1317.96,1318.39,-- no -- no parties --
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1318.39,1318.76,-- comes that?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1318.76,1319.29,-- and so that --
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.29,1319.96,What overcomes that?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1319.96,1332.275,"-- presumption is overcome if you have facts that are sufficient to show in fairness and justice that the individual should bear the burden. And an example, we can draw straight out of eminent domain law."
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1364.02,1384.505,"So what's the difference between that and the factors that the other parties are using that says look at how the property's been used over time. Here, the family has a house on one parcel, a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on another."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1399.225,1399.45,Right.
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1399.45,1401.355,So what's the difference --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1401.355,1402.32,I think you have a --
2016.15-214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1402.32,1403.24,-- in terms of --

2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1436.58,1437.53,They don't have a barbecue.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.53,1440.155,"Under your -- well, whatever they have. (Laughter.)"

2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1457.485,1458.33,The --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.33,1467.725,"Figure out the fair value? Don't you figure out the value of that on the market to a buyer, not the loss to the seller because he's next door? That has to be."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1467.725,1481.04,"The -- the rule begins with paying for the parking lot, and the burden is on the landowner to show that they -- that person should get additional compensation for the impact to the hotel. That's where that comes from."
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.04,1483.22,That just can't be if they're separate lots.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1485.75,1488.93,That's the unity of -- of use rule.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1492.855,1495.34,But that's -- that's when there's a single parcel.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1495.34,1495.78,No.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1499.62,1504.395,"Well, then, under your view, the landowner wins either way."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1504.395,1506.13,It depends on --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1506.13,1508.33,"If the value is great, he gets the double value."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1513.85,1515.54,There has to be in --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1515.54,1516.29,In your example --

2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.29,1534.6,"Well, we won't --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1534.6,1535.69,It's the same principle here.
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1535.69,1540.68,"But you're the one who's insisting on divisible -- on -- on the lots being treated separately, not --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1540.68,1541.55,I'm insisting on --
2016.15-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.55,1542.15,-- not in my question.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1542.15,1549.85,"-- the same presumption that you begin the analysis by identifying the relevant parcel. Here, that has to be Lot E."
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.31,1559.165,You say you would begin the analysis.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1586.21,1591.9,"It's -- it's not a physical taking, but it may have the same practical effect."
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1591.9,1592.3,But that's a --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1592.3,1597.0,"-- because the -- the value of Lot E is diminished from $410,000 to $40,000."
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.79,1606.13,But there is some use that can be made of this other --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1606.13,1610.65,Lot E cannot be developed on its own.
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1612.665,1616.365,"Yes, but is it -- if you -- the combined properties are sold --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1616.365,1616.9,But --
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.9,1619.12,-- it's going to be a much bigger price tag --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1619.12,1619.6,But the --
2016.15-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.6,1622.52,-- than if just F was sold.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1622.52,1629.475,"But the question is, the -- the Murrs began with two building sites on separate properties."
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.53,1662.28,Let me give you -- let me give you an example which might help me.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1692.21,1697.72,That hypothetical is not analogous to this situation.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1697.72,1699.92,I don't care if it's analogous or not analogous.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1704.295,1704.88,Same --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1704.88,1706.87,"-- different things make my thinking clearer, and --"
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1706.87,1707.34,You have --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.34,1708.825,-- this may be one of them. (Laughter.)
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1708.825,1714.37,The analysis has to begin by defining the parcel of property that is regulated.
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1714.37,1726.515,"You opinion -- in your opinion, if, in the Holmes case, instead of one person owning the whole 50 acres as one lot, there would have been 50 people who each owned an acre."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1733.05,1733.925,If someone --
2016.15-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.925,1735.195,Yes or no?
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1735.195,1737.43,It does make a difference.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1745.73,1746.36,So the usual way --
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1746.36,1747.52,There's two questions here.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1747.52,1759.58,"The usual way, Mr. Groen, or at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is split up into 100 one-acre parcels."
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1782.04,1786.76,The beginning part of your analysis says the developer subdivided.
2016.15-214,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1796.7,1796.94,Yes.
2016.15-214,0,62822,john_m_groen,,1809.685,1815.24,The merger provision is like the wetlands provision: Both restrict use.
2016.15-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1845.635,1851.795,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tseytlin."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,1851.795,1865.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin, Mr. Chief Justice, by answering your question, or the point that you made. The lots here have merged for all relevant purposes under State law."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.87,1876.66,Your -- your point is -- raises my exact concern.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,1937.545,1938.18,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.25,1955.67,"Well, but the --"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,1955.67,1956.35,The key point is --
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1956.35,1957.71,But the key point is they didn't do that.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,1996.195,1998.84,"Well, Your Honor, let me explain the State's methodology."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2023.54,2026.99,"So if lots are contiguous, that's the end of the question for you; right?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2026.99,2028.88,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.98,2042.56,But are you -- you're talking just about State law.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2058.9,2059.89,"Right, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2078.75,2084.785,But the reasonable investment-backed expectation was based on the fact that you had a lot-line rule which you've now changed.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2089.265,2091.085,"Your Honor, I want to be clear."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2109.59,2111.08,"Well, let me give you this example."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2119.36,2119.71,Uh-huh.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2119.71,2126.96,"And they say, you know, we're going to -- there's a lot next door, let's buy that; we can use it as a yard for our children when they're growing up."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2165.375,2167.225,"Your Honor, I want to clarify."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2179.86,2182.52,"What do you mean by they were ""involuntarily merged by government action""?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2182.52,2184.375,"That is, there was a -- they had two lots."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.375,2184.74,Right.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2184.74,2186.095,Same person had two lots.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2186.095,2186.24,Right.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2186.24,2188.6,They were each completely independent under State law.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2196.21,2198.005,That wouldn't fall under your regulation?
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.005,2198.17,Yeah.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2199.415,2200.18,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.325,2214.37,But it's by voluntary action as defined by State law.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2220.445,2226.25,"Well, Your Honor, I think the questions that Justice Kagan was asking clarified this point."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2236.8,2244.845,"And that's a very fine argument, except for the fact that it's completely contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2258.84,2261.17,That is not correct.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2325.9,2326.335,"Now, which --"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2326.335,2327.585,Go ahead.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2327.585,2339.945,"If -- if one lot is owned by a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is owned by the owner in the owner's own name, are they considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin law?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2339.945,2340.63,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2340.63,2341.39,No.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2341.39,2344.95,"Unless you can pierce the corporate veil, which is obviously a very high standard."
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2344.95,2346.61,What -- what about --
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2346.61,2350.44,"-- the same with husband -- husband owns one lot, wife owns the other; they're different?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2350.44,2352.28,The State hasn't taken a final position on that.
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2356.28,2357.51,Would interpret it what way?
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2357.51,2367.33,"Interpret it that if they're not literally the same person, even if it's husband and wife, even if it's two people and one of them owns one and one of them owns the other, and it's not the same two people and they were --"
2016.15-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.33,2368.34,May I correct you --
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2368.34,2368.68,I'm sorry.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2370.01,2372.22,That is my understanding of the county's interpretation.
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.22,2374.19,"Well, what is? That it -- that it's still treated separately?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2374.19,2375.43,That if two owns the exact --
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2375.43,2392.47,"Well, that makes it seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in separate names that they would be a entirely different situation."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2392.47,2395.59,"Well, let me explain what the State is trying to achieve in this law."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2419.34,2422.72,"Well, they won't after today, I mean -- or if you win. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2422.72,2425.17,You'll be -- you'll be smart enough to say: Okay.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2435.43,2435.93,Well --
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.93,2439.27,Does it really -- does the whole takings issue really turn on that?
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2439.27,2440.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2468.45,2477.695,"Well, I would suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can build a common house on the two lots, can't they?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2477.695,2494.7,"The -- the merger of the two lots are bringing into common ownership makes it easier to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on the area about minimum lot size and things of that sort. If you don't bring them into common ownership, then you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure that's on your nonconforming lot."
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2494.7,2501.115,May -- may I have one question? It's a background question. Suppose these people had Lots E and F merged.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2506.6,2510.93,"It would depend on the size of G and H, how much net project area."
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.78,2513.87,"Well, suppose -- suppose they're just like these lots."
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2513.87,2516.42,"Well, Your Honor, so right now, it's about .9 --"
2016.15-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2516.42,2521.19,"If they have E and F, then they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2521.19,2522.93,"Right, Your Honor, just -- just let me have two seconds."
2016.15-214,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2542.075,2542.37,General --
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2542.37,2547.44,"It makes no difference under your approach that the two lots were taxed separately, does it?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2547.44,2547.96,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.99,2548.78,So that doesn't make it.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2553.515,2554.655,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.655,2561.77,Are there other aspects in which the two lots are treated separately that make no difference under your approach?
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2561.77,2566.935,"So with regard to the tax assessor, that was an -- that was an error that the tax assessor made."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2581.09,2584.015,Are these lots actually separate under State law?
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2584.015,2590.66,"There is no legal situation in which the lot line between Lot E and Lot F makes any difference right now, none."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2590.66,2593.03,So -- so that's not quite an answer.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2600.175,2601.155,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2601.155,2612.175,So to what extent is it wrong for me to understand that the only -- the only sense in which the merger doctrine that you're talking about applies is with respect to a takings claim?
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2612.175,2613.14,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.355,2642.48,"And then so there's no reason -- under State law, there is a procedure to eliminate the lot lines, and you're saying that that procedure is irrelevant in this case?"
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2642.48,2645.43,Given the specific facts of this case it would be completely irrelevant.
2016.15-214,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.55,2651.77,General --
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2651.77,2652.41,-- deleted that lot line.
2016.15-214,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2652.41,2653.08,May I ask a question.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2702.405,2707.32,Because what you get with any of their approaches is Penn Central squared.
2016.15-214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2732.55,2742.525,Would it matter to you if it were not possible to build a house that bridged the two lots? Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a cliff.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2743.945,2747.2,In defining what the relevant parcel is it would not.
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.4,2757.57,Sure.
2016.15-214,1,62823,misha_tseytlin,,2757.57,2773.8,"We believe that most of the work under takings law should be done at that second step, usually Penn Central. We believe the first step, the parcel question, should be determined in a straightforward way so the Court can move on to doing the hard work of Penn Central. Thank you, Your Honors."
2016.15-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.8,2791.41,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lazarus."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2791.41,2808.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just like cities and counties in at least 33 States have done for decades, for more than 40 years, St. Croix County has excluded from its grandfather clause for preexisting lots commonly owned substandard adjacent lots."
2016.15-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2820.89,2831.3,"Well, that's -- and it gets to the questions I was asking early, fairness and justness. But the -- and if -- actually the -- the point is -- last made by -- by your friend, there are two different questions."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2862.8,2874.61,"Your Honor, in -- in this case, in Valley, there is some circularity here, but let me tell you why there is some circularity here. And that is because they're making and taking the challenge to a very odd -- a very odd topic, and that is the absence of an exclusion."
2016.15-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2912.04,2931.425,"How can you say that the impact is not -- is categorically not great? If some -- somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the expectation of selling it at some point in the future to meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't sell it, that there's no hardship there?"
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2931.425,2934.975,The -- the hardship -- the question though is how do you define the extent of the hardship.
2016.15-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2965.77,2974.355,"Well, that's fine except that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put together, they would have to move away."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2974.355,2974.975,Right.
2016.15-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2976.41,2977.785,"Now, they think that's irrelevant."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2977.785,2981.305,The takings inquiry is what the economic impact is on them.
2016.15-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2988.885,2996.77,"I thought the -- I thought that what you're saying is we have to look at what's fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the situation of -- of the particular people who are involved."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2996.77,2997.25,"Well, no."
2016.15-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.19,3095.905,It seems to me you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land interest is.
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3117.615,3122.235,"What -- what you're doing -- what you're doing, Your Honor, is you're trying to determine the economic impact."
2016.15-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3166.13,3171.675,"Well, what about adding here when I look to see the reasonableness of the regulation."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3184.04,3194.16,"Well, certainly it's true, the ultimate analysis, you pay attention to reasonableness. You -- you pay attention to whether the government -- you don't get to accept the government saying it doesn't automatically qualify --"
2016.15-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.16,3195.515,Does that fit in your three?
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3195.515,3197.12,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-214,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.08,3286.63,I'm sorry.
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3297.63,3298.34,Because --
2016.15-214,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3298.34,3307.61,"The two values -- your example said the two lots put together are less valuable, or more valuable?"
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3307.61,3308.88,Just a little less valuable.
2016.15-214,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3308.88,3309.22,Yeah.
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3332.92,3333.19,No.
2016.15-214,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3349.37,3355.52,"I understand why the combination, but why would anybody buy the lot you can't develop on?"
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3355.52,3361.855,"Well, the question is not the -- what the value of Lot E as a unit that you can't develop or -- or build on."
2016.15-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3379.335,3386.46,"Is this right? Just say yes or no, and if it's wrong, I'll figure it out later. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3386.46,3405.3,"Are you saying -- look, of course you look at the lines that the State draws, but that isn't determinative because you want to know the total impact on the person, which may get you to look at nearby property or other things."
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3421.94,3424.005,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer the question?"
2016.15-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.005,3425.185,He wanted one word.
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3425.185,3427.83,Yes. (Laughter.)
2016.15-214,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3427.83,3428.12,Yes.
2016.15-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.695,3435.585,"Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Prelogar."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3435.585,3462.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with your question, Mr. Chief Justice, about why it wouldn't be sensible to just look at lot lines here as the starting point for defining the parcel as a whole. And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar as they might shape reasonable expectations about how property owners expect to use their property and what they expect to remain separate and distinct."
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3474.02,3475.525,Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3475.525,3484.01,"Turning to the practical point first, especially when you're looking at contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the situation the Court is confronting here."
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.29,3523.42,So that's -- I just don't know how that works with -- with property.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3531.61,3532.23,Temporal.
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.23,3537.75,"Temporal considerations. Now, you usually don't say that when you're asking about property."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3565.355,3577.76,"I think it's absolutely the case that for terms -- in terms of defining what's a protected property interest, at the outset you look to State law, you look to lot lines, and no one's contesting here that there's a protected property interest."
2016.15-214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3613.34,3624.465,"The problem I have with your test, which has the -- the three components, is I don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to the State property lines."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3624.465,3624.98,Well --
2016.15-214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3624.98,3628.16,You don't explicitly list it among those three items.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3639.705,3651.79,"We think that it frequently goes to the functional considerations because it shapes expectations about how land can properly be used, whether it's an entirely separate and distinct issue. So we do think that there's a role for State law to play."
2016.15-214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3653.97,3661.245,"If we think there should be more of a role, where would you put it? St. Croix puts it on the second prong."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3666.27,3671.92,I think it's very important not to adopt any kind of presumption or bright line rule for the relevant parcel.
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3698.49,3708.44,"Suppose you have lots that are not contiguous but they're very close to each other. Now, under your flexible approach with all these different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single parcel?"
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3708.44,3715.28,I think it would be very difficult to say that those kinds of noncontiguous properties function as an integrated economic unit.
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3740.56,3759.655,That can easily be taken care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as defined at the time of the acquisition rather than something that was done prior to -- prior to the time when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3786.35,3795.59,I think the clearest articulation I have is to say that you should be looking for what in the interest of fairness and justice is an accurate way to measure economic impact.
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3801.88,3809.965,And is it the economic impact on these particular owners or on some category of hypothetical owners?
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3809.965,3814.12,It's always been an individualized inquiry focused on these particular owners.
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3826.53,3842.28,But what if a lot -- but what if a lot was -- was preserved? What if it was bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be sold?
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3842.28,3855.78,"I think that those kinds of reasonable investment-backed expectations have a role to play, but I don't think that they can be dispositive. Because, again, the point of the relevant parcel determination is to accurately gauge economic impact. But I do think that it's important --"
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3855.78,3861.22,"Well, why wouldn't they be determinative? I thought you said it was we look to legitimate expectations."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3863.96,3872.935,"It's certainly the case that anytime anyone's alleging a regulatory taking, the premise of the claim is that they're being prevented from doing something with their property that they wanted to do with it."
2016.15-214,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3889.51,3896.94,"Well, that comes back to my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move. They can't afford to build a big house here, which is what everybody wants."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3902.845,3924.515,"But to the extent that a court were to conclude that that is an undue interference with their investment-backed expectations or that the character of that government action is actually unjust and anomalus, then I think that this Court's precedent already builds in sufficient protection for those kinds of interest without trying to rely solely on expectations to identify the relevant parcel."
2016.15-214,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3924.515,3928.78,I -- but I thought reasonable investment-backed expectations were objective.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3930.685,3931.15,"Oh, no."
2016.15-214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3960.57,3967.855,"Well, I actually think they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's, from my timeline, creation."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3979.385,3980.2,That's correct.
2016.15-214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3980.69,3992.19,"So neither the parents or the children, if they had been paying attention to the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that the ordinance wouldn't affect them."
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3992.19,3993.48,That's exactly correct.
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4029.005,4032.87,"But by saying ""effectively merged,"" you mean not really merged?"
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,4032.87,4033.52,Absolutely.
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4038.9,4040.76,Except with respect to takings.
2016.15-214,3,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,4040.76,4041.19,No.
2016.15-214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4051.005,4055.285,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Groen, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4055.285,4074.18,"Thank you. Beginning with the multifactor nuanced approach, the reason why that kind of approach to defining the property interest -- remember, the first issue, you have to define the property interest that is the subject of the takings -- of the takings claim."
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4088.9,4091.865,With the regulations that affect those boundaries.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4091.865,4092.56,I'm sorry?
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4092.56,4095.78,With the regulations that affect those boundaries.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4099.03,4099.39,But we --
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4099.39,4108.25,-- they look at what the paper talks about as a property line and what regulations do with respect to that line.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4108.25,4117.87,"And when the regulations redefine and impose a new definition, the reliance that previously existed is undermined."
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4124.8,4125.45,So what do we do --
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4125.45,4126.18,It's a redefinition --
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4126.18,4148.31,"-- with the fact as I see it that these properties were bought separately, one by the parents, the other by their company, and that post regulations, knowing exactly what they were doing -- and you say they didn't, but that has to do with their choice, because you buy everything subject to regulation."
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4169.21,4170.21,"Yes, they did."
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4182.6,4188.545,But you get to use everything you own with -- subject to regulatory requirements.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4188.545,4189.0,That's right.
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4189.0,4196.015,"I buy a piece of property 10 years ago or 20 years ago, and I didn't know I had to put a sprinkler system in."
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4200.455,4200.66,But --
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4200.66,4204.24,There's lots of regulations that you didn't buy expecting --
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4204.24,4204.84,That's right.
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4204.84,4206.12,-- but they do affect you.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4206.12,4212.27,"But the Murrs bought two separate parcels that comprised two separate building lots, and that has now --"

2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4212.87,4212.95,They --
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4212.95,4213.63,-- away from them.
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4213.63,4214.77,They didn't buy them.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4214.77,4215.45,That --
2016.15-214,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4215.45,4220.175,They got them in 1982 subject to knowing that they could only develop on one.
2016.15-214,4,62822,john_m_groen,,4220.175,4235.17,"Well, that circles right back to the Palazzolo argument that we discussed earlier. The other issue I'd like to address is this reliance that -- that I -- that we're just talking about with subdivisions and deeds, that is a system that all of this country relies upon."
