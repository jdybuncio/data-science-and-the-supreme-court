1992.92-725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.058,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-725, Salvador Godinez v. Richard Allan Moran."
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,45.751,52.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.159,180.88,"Do you say that the finding of knowing and intelligent waiver is a higher standard or a lower standard or indistinguishable from what the Ninth Circuit found was the standard, which was I believe a reasoned choice?"
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,180.88,198.039,"Our position in this case, Your Honor, is that once a defendant meets a standard of competence established by this Court in Dusky, then a defendant is competent to proceed either to waive counsel, to plead guilty, or to proceed to trial."
1992.92-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.042,216.112,What do you think you have to show to say that a defendant is competent to assist counsel in his defense?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,231.302,236.344,"--To answer your second question first, yes, there are reasoned choices that have to be made--"
1992.92-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.344,238.107,Such as whether to testify?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,238.107,245.29,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is a critical choice that each defendant if they choose to proceed to trial must make."
1992.92-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.809,291.563,"Well, do you think then that in order to determine whether a defendant is able to assist counsel in his own defense that the determination of mental competence of necessity includes a determination of whether he can make a reasoned choice?"
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,291.563,295.323,"We believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.637,323.973,"Did the trial court ask the wrong question and reach the right answer or did it ask the right question and reach the right answer, in your opinion?"
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,323.973,338.042,"We believe that the trial judge, Judge Leavitt, both asked the correct question and received the answer which was in context and directly addressed to the judge's question both--"
1992.92-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.042,346.306,"It's not altogether precise, it seems to me, when we're concerned with the competency to waive that you asked about competency to stand trial."
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,356.764,390.715,"--It is our position that if a defendant is assessed and it is determined by the trial court that he has a factual and rational understanding of the proceedings, that he has the ability to assist, not necessarily that counsel actually is assisting, because as was the case here the defendant ultimately chose not to have counsel, but if he does have that ability to assist he has, he meets the baseline standard which also includes the ability to make a reasoned choice."
1992.92-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,413.911,418.415,Is competency comprehended within knowing and intelligent voluntary waiver?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,433.735,439.568,--I believe that the judge has to independently ascertain that the defendant is competent and--
1992.92-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.568,441.539,So that's different than knowing and intelligent?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,441.539,442.02,--Yes.
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.006,585.393,The court of appeals said they weren't bound by the results of a state court hearing because they applied the wrong standard?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,585.393,586.885,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.885,592.258,And they said that their standard of reasoned choice is a higher standard?
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,592.258,594.428,"Yes, that's what they said."
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.428,595.87,So they must have thought it was.
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,604.316,606.196,"No, we would not."
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.082,652.376,"Well, it set aside a state court... it refused to follow a state court finding that otherwise it should have."
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,652.376,673.26,"--Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit relied on a premise that merely because the state courts applied an incorrect standard as far as the law is concerned that its factual findings were not due any deference, and we would certainly take issue with that."
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.544,729.426,But they were looking at it from the standpoint of their standare.
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,729.426,730.888,That's correct.
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.888,735.902,Which you say was wrong.
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,741.955,750.401,Regardless of the standard to be applied they should not have substituted its judgment and allocated different weights than the state courts.
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.132,788.165,"Do you think this argument you're making now is within your question presented, the single question presented?"
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,788.165,791.638,"--We believe... yes, Your Honor, in this sense."
1992.92-725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.638,807.078,I thought the only question you presented was whether the Constitution requires a trial court to apply a heightened reasoned choice standard to determine competency of a defendant to enter a plea of guilty or waive counsel.
1992.92-725,0,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,807.078,809.559,That is the question presented.
1992.92-725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.232,952.975,"Very well, Mr. Sarnowski."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,954.865,966.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.216,1070.581,"Do you think that the tests that we have frequently articulated with respect to pleas of guilty and waivers of counsel, do you know of any case where in such a case we used the Dusky language?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1076.976,1078.095,"Well, there--"
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.095,1078.765,Isn't that the test?
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1078.765,1079.356,--Right.
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.356,1080.695,That's what you usually read.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1080.695,1081.206,Right.
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.511,1128.347,"So you think in testing out the validity of a plea of guilty then you should not only ask whether it's voluntary and intelligent, but you should go through the Dusky catechism too?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1128.347,1128.667,--Right.
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.929,1130.68,Is that right?
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1131.061,1131.59,--Yes.
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.567,1150.752,"Well, that may be so where competency is challenged, but say in the ordinary case there's no challenge to the competency of somebody and yet, and he wants to plead guilty."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1155.565,1165.332,"Well, you're right, Your Honor, there would be, you're correct insofar as you're saying that you don't explicitly need to make a finding of competence for every defendant."
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.879,1189.91,"But even if they go through the Dusky routine and find the person competent, to sustain a plea of guilty you should go, you should go on to find it at least voluntary?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1189.91,1190.938,Of course.
1992.92-725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.889,1192.49,And intelligent?
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1192.49,1196.371,"Yes, but we think that's very different from what the court said in this case."
1992.92-725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.761,1242.012,"Well, Ms. Wax, the Ninth Circuit appeared to be concerned about the fact that the defendant was on medication and the trial court didn't know the effect of the medication, and that the answers were monosyllabic, and so forth."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1250.468,1251.81,Yes.
1992.92-725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.441,1258.225,They might be relevant to competence as well.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1258.225,1259.023,--Yes.
1992.92-725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.091,1281.008,"Well, I'm just trying to find out whether the, some of the things that bothered the Ninth Circuit are appropriately looked at not only in the question of competence but in knowing whether it's knowing and intelligent."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1281.008,1284.871,"--We think they could look, be looked at under both rubrics."
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.654,1359.068,"Ms. Wax, do you understand that that would be necessary even when the man has been determined to be competent in the Dusky sense and also has counsel?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1359.068,1361.431,--It's--
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.431,1371.346,"Most trials you do have a lawyer there, and I had sort of assumed that if you have the lawyer then, having survived the Dusky standard, that's all you need."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1371.346,1380.152,"--Well, if you're asking whether this Dusky standard applies when you have a lawyer and when you don't have a lawyer, we would say it applies under both circumstances."
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.152,1383.565,"Well, the Dusky, you have to satisfy the Dusky standard always, I suppose."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1383.565,1384.076,Yes.
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.076,1397.263,"But then I'm asking you whether you think under the Ninth Circuit's holding that when you do, when you satisfy the Dusky standard and when you do have a lawyer you also have to satisfy a higher standard on every other thing that might arise during the trial?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1397.263,1410.142,"We think the Ninth Circuit said that because it said setting aside the waiver of counsel issue, it implied, I think, that if you plead guilty then you need some special capacity to make that choice."
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.142,1410.703,But this is pleading guilty without a lawyer.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1410.703,1417.686,With or without... we didn't read the Ninth Circuit to say that it only applied because this person didn't have a lawyer.
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.317,1422.15,"Well, would you have the same objection to the Ninth Circuit holding if it were limited in that respect?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1422.15,1423.721,"--Yes, we would."
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.631,1439.08,One of which is to cooperate with counsel.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1439.08,1440.041,--Yes.
1992.92-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.824,1445.255,Right.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1445.255,1449.088,That is a way of measuring a certain mental capacity.
1992.92-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.583,1468.439,"Ms. Wax, is this case about the standard that should be used or is it really about whether the defendant was entitled to a hearing?"
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1472.864,1503.492,"The way the Ninth, we would say that the way the Ninth Circuit decided the case, although they did fault the court for not holding a hearing, we think they did hold a hearing by the way, ultimately the rule of decision here was that there was an erroneous standard for competence applied, and the Ninth Circuit implied that if Dusky really was the standard the findings, at least at the post conviction stage, hearing stage, would have been sufficient to ground a finding of competence."
1992.92-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.273,1506.364,Was that the focus of the attack before the Ninth Circuit?
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1506.364,1526.438,"--Before the Ninth Circuit respondent said in fairly crude terms that his plea and his waiver were invalid, and he didn't really parse out the competence and whether it was knowing and voluntary factors terribly well and he didn't specifically argue that the wrong standard was used."
1992.92-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.438,1527.719,But he did say I should have had a hearing.
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1529.02,1531.972,"That was... yes, that was one of the things he argued."
1992.92-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.944,1540.277,"Subsequently, after you decide whether you need a hearing or not, I suppose you then have to decide what standard you apply."
1992.92-725,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1544.15,1546.263,"Well, our answer is that there was a hearing."
1992.92-725,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.263,1548.164,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1550.615,1559.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.199,1614.926,The Ninth Circuit thought it was applying a higher standard because that's the reason it refused to follow the state court determination.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1614.926,1621.532,"--They did apply a reasoned choice, but it's a higher standard in terms of what their decision was."
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.951,1636.872,"Well, what is the standard--"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1648.839,1657.885,The whole Sieling v. Eyman case that the Ninth Circuit relied upon is based upon Westbrook and Pate.
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.24,1692.368,"Mr. Potter, Westbrook is an unargued per curiam, 1 page long, which really does not get a great deal of precedential deference from our Court."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1692.368,1696.779,"--That is correct, but it's a due process case."
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.779,1698.962,"Well, so it's a due process case."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1700.832,1703.454,And it stands for the precedent that--
1992.92-725,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1703.454,1706.416,"Well, what about the Massey case which preceded it?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1706.416,1707.337,--Same thing.
1992.92-725,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1708.847,1709.668,That was not a per curiam.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1709.668,1710.84,That's correct.
1992.92-725,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.873,1725.64,In your submission what is the standard that a trial court should use in determining competency to plead guilty and to waive the assistance of counsel?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1725.64,1733.464,--It's a decisional competency that's entwined with Johnson v. Zerbst as to voluntariness.
1992.92-725,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.346,1750.265,"Maybe we do, maybe we don't."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1769.758,1774.46,"Well, the standard is the reasoned or the voluntariness and the intelligent waiver."
1992.92-725,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.022,1784.097,"So you think knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver includes, comprehends competency?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1784.097,1784.608,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.936,1800.538,It doesn't sound to me like you're really defending the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1806.043,1811.716,The rationale that the Ninth Circuit used is that the state courts used an improper standard.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.716,1812.004,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1812.805,1813.256,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.068,1823.083,"So you say... I though you should answer, you should have answered Justice Kennedy then the standard is reasoned choice."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1827.776,1832.518,"--Well, there is, that can be accepted as the proper standard."
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.133,1864.581,So you want us to decide that there wasn't a sufficient inquiry here and therefore to affirm?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1864.581,1865.63,--Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.63,1876.228,"That's, I suppose that isn't the way the Ninth Circuit went about it, but you want us to affirm on that ground even though you didn't cross appeal their opinion?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1876.228,1883.963,"Well, they, the Ninth Circuit did say that an improper standard was applied, the improper standard being the reasonable choice standard."
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1885.922,1895.549,Why isn't Ms. Wax correct in what she said a moment ago that the voluntary and reasonableness standard which you're pegging your case on now presupposes competence?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1915.602,1925.24,"--Because she presupposed in the answer that in fact the individual did not have these other factors, presupposed that--"
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.24,1926.471,What other factors?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1927.072,1936.977,--The factors that the court was aware of when they did their initial analysis about the fact that he was competent to assist counsel and had an understanding.
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.328,1947.385,You mean whether the court is inquiring into competence or whether the court is inquiring into voluntariness it could take account of the medication?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1948.234,1948.794,--Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.948,1977.813,"Well then why, why then doesn't your argument boil down to what was suggested a moment ago, that you're really not necessarily... number one, you're not defending the Ninth Circuit, and number two, your argument really goes not to the need for a new standard of competence in general but to the need for as particularized an inquiry when there is a waiver of counsel as there is when there is a plea of guilty."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1979.756,1980.247,--Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.735,1983.058,But that's not what the Ninth Circuit held.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,1983.058,1983.927,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.009,2032.23,"Well, if it... if we were to decide as a matter of law that the Dusky competency standard was perfectly satisfactory for the original inquiry as to competency and that individual waivers of rights would have to be judged by what the court could look at at that particular time, then ought not the state trial court's findings to receive deference because they did, that court did receive, did apply the correct standard, the Dusky standard which would be applicable?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2032.23,2036.842,But that is the actual competency and not as to due process.
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.842,2042.098,"Well, what's... I don't understand your distinction there, Mr. Potter."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2049.4,2053.063,Under the voluntariness aspects of the case--
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.063,2055.393,You're really talking about a procedural due process.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2055.393,2055.855,--Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.775,2067.242,"That you can't be brought to trial unless you're competent to make the necessary decisions that go along with a trial, but that's the Dusky standard."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2067.242,2072.686,"Well, that's the Dusky standard, but not as to specific and actual decisions."
1992.92-725,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.944,2114.252,Did the defendant before the Ninth Circuit argue for a higher standard for determining competency to enter a plea and waive counsel?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2114.252,2116.174,We cited Sieling v. Eyman.
1992.92-725,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.489,2125.15,The focus of your argument was to get a hearing at that stage?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2125.15,2125.58,--Right.
1992.92-725,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.092,2174.961,"Do you think that in order to be competent to stand trial, which includes competence to assist counsel in the defense, that that includes a capacity to make reasoned decisions?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2174.961,2175.432,--Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2176.824,2181.176,But then you agree with your opposition on that.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2181.176,2183.887,I'm sorry?
1992.92-725,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2183.887,2188.752,I say then you agree with your opposition in that respect.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2190.102,2199.999,"Well, in this situation he comes in to waive a decision in terms of the context of when the decision is made."
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.685,2228.218,It sounds like you're back where you were in the court of appeals.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2230.38,2232.55,We didn't have a hearing--
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.55,2240.565,Your complaint is that you did not have a particular hearing at the particular time on the particular reasoned decision to be made.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2240.565,2241.226,--That's correct.
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.226,2244.077,It's not so much the standard that you're worried about.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2244.077,2244.548,That's right.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.08,2268.664,You say the hearing you got in the state courts was not an adequate hearing?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2268.664,2270.574,--It didn't focus on the right standard--
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.574,2273.086,"Well, anyway, you say it was not an adequate hearing."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2273.086,2274.728,--As to that issue.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.728,2275.339,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2282.042,2287.345,"The finding would be as to law on the due process issue, and that's the distinction."
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.551,2421.603,"Then again it does not require a higher standard, it just requires a separate inquiry?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2421.603,2427.317,"That's correct, and that was our argument that we were asking for in terms of the due process."
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.317,2447.841,"Well, I mean, I suppose you can be fully competent and yet not have made an effective waiver because all the facts weren't in front of you or because you misunderstood the consequence, or so forth and so on, right?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2452.523,2470.976,There is a difference between the actual competence and the specific inquiry as to whether in fact an individual can make decisional matters such as the waiver of counsel and the right to give up his assistance.
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.027,2475.399,Your right to a hearing doesn't just go to competence.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2485.735,2486.296,--Right.
1992.92-725,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.867,2488.266,So it's not really a competence question at all.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2500.174,2502.217,We're saying it's a different focus.
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.217,2518.807,"Are you saying, Mr. Potter, that, put the Dusky standard here for competence to stand trial, and over here put the inquiry as to whether a particular, say a decision not to take the stand was knowing and voluntary?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2530.785,2532.355,That's what Pate says--
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.355,2535.458,I'm asking what is your contention.
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2536.139,2544.183,"--My contention is yes, if there are factors that show that there's a continuing duty on the part of the court that the individual brings forward some--"
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.183,2549.448,So there's a third test that the state has to satisfy?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2549.448,2550.817,--It's not a third test.
1992.92-725,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2579.905,2585.319,"You agree that there was a general inquiry as to competency at this hearing, do you not?"
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2585.319,2585.87,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.323,2611.719,Are you talking about the post conviction hearing or at the criminal trial?
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2611.719,2615.19,At the criminal trial or the entry of plea.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.693,2636.543,"Well, I thought the challenge was to the, in the post conviction hearing the case was in state habeas, or whatever you want to call it, was that the defendant challenged the voluntariness of his plea."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2636.543,2637.375,We did.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.189,2648.061,"Well, you had an evidentiary hearing in the post conviction, at the post conviction stage."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2648.061,2653.695,"--No, in terms of a hearing as to his competency at the time of the plea."
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2676.87,2701.936,"Mr. Potter, a minute ago if I understood you I thought you answered a question of mine in this way, that what was defective in this case was the failure of the court to make the kind of knowingness and voluntariness inquiry upon the waiver or attempted waiver of counsel that would have been required if the defendant had pleaded guilty."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2757.923,2758.634,Yes.
1992.92-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.308,2805.695,"Whether or not that's so, it sounds to me as though what you're arguing now is basically that there was an error under existing law."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2815.75,2816.171,That's correct.
1992.92-725,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.451,2853.446,"If you're not defending the higher standard requirement that the Ninth Circuit insisted on, I suppose if we disabuse them of that we could, we wouldn't need to decide the argument you're making now."
1992.92-725,2,19763,cal_j_potter_iii,,2859.451,2861.021,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-725,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.71,2900.497,"Thank you, Mr. Potter."
1992.92-725,3,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,2903.819,2913.584,The Ninth Circuit clearly disposed of this case below by applying the heightened standard.
1992.92-725,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.478,2946.355,"I suppose it would have had to do that in order to reverse the state court's determination, wouldn't it, because otherwise the state court's determination is subject to deference under 2254(d)?"
1992.92-725,3,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,2946.355,2948.696,"That's our position, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-725,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.696,2951.759,You think that's why the Ninth Circuit felt constrained to find a higher standard?
1992.92-725,3,21602,david_f_sarnowski,,2951.759,2960.196,"I suppose it would border somewhat on speculation on my part, but it would seem that's one reading of their decision."
1992.92-725,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.239,3072.728,"Thank you, Mr. Sarnowski."
