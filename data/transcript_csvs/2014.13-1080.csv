2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13-1080, Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,8.454,11.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,48.897,50.197,"Go ahead, please."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,50.197,58.453,"--And third, requiring Amtrak to approve the metrics and standards before they went into effect is not a delegation outside the government under this Court's cases."
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.453,67.725,"I think the Lebron argument, Marsh v. Alabama, the company town case, no one says that it was a governmental agency."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,83.154,83.654,No.
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.01,94.243,"Well, you could say the same thing about Marsh v. Alabama."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,94.243,112.321,"Well, I think that the difference is that the Court recognized in Lebron that Amtrak is a government-created corporation that is under the government's control and that under the government's control both because of the management control that it has over it and because it created the purposes for which Amtrak exists and the things that it has to do."
2014.13-1080,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,128.183,138.055,"If Amtrak is governmental for nondelegation purposes, is it also governmental for appointments clause purposes?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,138.055,156.868,"Well, I think that that follows from the -- the way the Court approached the question about the PCAOB and Free Enterprise Fund where Congress had also enacted a statute that said the PCAOB was not an agency or instrumentality of government, that no board members or employees were going to be considered officers or employees of the Federal government."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,169.626,178.882,"I was just going to say your argument that Amtrak is governmental for purposes of -- that doesn't get you to the finish line, right?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,192.039,194.841,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to the arbitrator provision."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,194.841,195.16,Right.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,195.16,200.212,"Before we get to the arbitrator provision, I do think that -- that this would resolve the question."
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.366,206.566,"Well, it wouldn't resolve the question."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,238.003,245.091,"--Well, to be sure, the Carter Coal case talked about both nondelegation ideas and also due process issues."
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.911,251.93,It was raised.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,251.93,252.88,It certainty was raised.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.88,254.799,And it's -- and it's argued here.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,254.799,257.484,It -- it has been argued in the red brief here.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.99,293.223,Yes.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,303.945,310.701,The statutory preference requirement is independent of the metrics and standards and preexists them.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.073,321.79,What must it consider?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,321.79,325.059,--The metrics and standards play a triggering and gatekeeping role.
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.442,412.583,"So in your -- in your view, the case would come out the same way if Amtrak could issue these metrics and standards entirely on its own, without consultation with the -- or cooperation with the government."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,413.5,414.269,One of the--
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.269,414.702,--same result?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,414.702,429.026,"--One prong of our argument is, yes, that because this is not regulatory in that sense, this is more like the neighbors being able to veto the billboard in the neighborhood in Cusack, which the Court said was okay in Roberge, because the statutory preference is presumptively bad."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,443.416,443.916,You may.
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.916,457.324,"That doesn't stop -- do the metes and standards stop you from initiating or stop the agency from initiating a review, even if a carrier meets the metes and standard?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,457.324,459.276,"--Well, it's -- it's not the carrier."
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.292,461.628,"No, it would be--"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,461.628,463.261,It would be Amtrak's own performance.
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,519.262,527.701,"--If we were -- if we were to rule that this is not a regulatory action, would that satisfy the entire case?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,532.855,533.788,--I -- I think that that is right.
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.933,553.266,On--
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.266,565.323,"If the -- if the actions are not regulatory, why -- why did Amtrak's performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court issued its decision in this case?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,565.323,571.81,"--Well, I think that's because of the -- that it decreased the threat of enforcement of the statutory preference."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,583.635,589.705,"They're going to be -- Amtrak can then force a proceeding at which the freight carriers will have to defend, right?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,589.705,590.439,--That -- that is correct.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,591.005,600.244,"Well, that's a significant regulatory impact, to tell railroads I, a private party, get to start a governmental proceeding and you have to show up to defend it."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,600.244,600.829,--Yes.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,601.546,607.483,"And, by the way, if I don't -- it's triggered if I don't comply with standards that I get to set."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,607.483,619.474,"--It's -- but we allow private parties to initiate governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings all the time, either before administrative agencies or courts, and we don't think that that is a delegation of legislative power--"
2014.13-1080,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,619.474,619.941,Mr. Gannon--
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,619.941,621.826,--to the person who is beginning the investigation.
2014.13-1080,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,621.826,630.349,--Is the -- is the government able to award damages without the showing that there's been a violation of the metrics and standards?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,630.349,630.766,No.
2014.13-1080,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,643.674,668.872,"But I would think if that's the case, if the statutory preference does not get -- is a -- if a violation of the statutory preference doesn't get you all the way to damages, if there is essentially a second requirement which is a violation of the metrics and standards, I mean, in effect what the -- a statute does is it says there are two things you need to show, a violation of the preference and a violation of the metrics and standards, in order to get to damages."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,672.426,689.888,"Well, I -- I -- I understand the impulse, but I think that seems -- it -- it also seems like the ability of the neighbors to veto the billboards in Cusack because what Amtrak -- all Amtrak has done is relax certain circumstances in which the freight railroads can be held liable for violating the statutory preference."
2014.13-1080,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,726.328,727.394,The statute says that the--
2014.13-1080,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,727.394,730.463,Can we -- can we get back to the arbitrator?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,737.218,737.618,--Yes.
2014.13-1080,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,737.618,745.289,"The arbitrator, it's argued, need not be a government officer."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,770.94,776.943,"Well, I -- I don't think that the terms of 207(d) contemplate that the arbitrator will come into effect again."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,796.657,797.94,"Well, but does that matter?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,804.661,807.796,"Yes, I -- I understand that question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.466,814.666,If--
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,814.666,815.735,--standards in the future--
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,815.735,816.035,--Right.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,816.035,816.902,--the arbitrator wouldn't be applicable.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.322,830.062,"Well, I know -- if I could -- there's -- the issues are pretty intertwined here, so I know it's a difficult thing to keep track of for you."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,838.85,840.467,--The metrics and standards have a regulatory affect.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,840.467,840.75,--Okay.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,862.549,866.318,"I -- I think that would constitute significant governmental authority under Buckley against Valeo, and that would be--"
2014.13-1080,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.318,871.655,"Well, you know, I'm quite interested in the government's view of this case, and I hope you will calm me down."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1001.789,1005.158,--I think it depends upon how broad the Court's ruling is.
2014.13-1080,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.541,1005.891,"No, no."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1034.443,1035.81,--And I frankly--
2014.13-1080,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1035.81,1037.545,Going back to Carter v. Carter Coal.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1037.545,1038.195,--Yes.
2014.13-1080,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1038.195,1039.345,We could go back to Lochner.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1039.345,1044.216,I don't think that -- that Respondent is asking for a ruling of that nature.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1083.158,1083.491,Thanks.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1089.978,1092.847,--I think that he would be an inferior officer given the limited nature of the--
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1092.847,1093.247,Okay.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1095.965,1097.782,--It -- it would be the STB that appointed him.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.782,1099.184,But he's an arbitrator.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1099.184,1100.367,He's an arbitrator.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1100.367,1101.703,One of the parties to the arbitration.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1101.703,1104.821,I don't think the STB is a party to the arbitration.
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1119.597,1124.901,"So if the STB doesn't like the arbitrator's decision, can the STB change it under the law?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1124.901,1128.686,I doubt it because it's supposed to be a binding arbitration.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.159,1142.444,I don't -- I don't see how you can say he's an inferior officer.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1150.7,1154.588,He's appointed by the super -- the Surface Transportation Board--
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.588,1154.938,That's it.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1156.238,1156.988,--to perform a limited task.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.722,1160.574,A limited task is -- is not the touchstone.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1180.136,1196.581,"Well, in that sense, it's consistent with Morrison, and it is not consistent with what the Court said was sufficient to enter the question in Edmund, but did not say was necessary to answer the question in Edmund about there being review within the Executive Branch of the decisions being made by the Coast Guard judges there."
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.581,1199.366,Let me -- let me talk about regulatory effect.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1203.401,1204.434,The metrics and standards.
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.434,1205.77,The metrics and standards.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1264.959,1272.313,"I -- I don't think that this is the same as the sentencing guidelines, the effect that it has on the judges, because those are advice to the judges."
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.302,1310.704,--Why did the record improve so -- so rapidly and so promptly?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1310.704,1331.951,"Because for the first time in decades there was a meaningful threat that there would be an enforcement proceeding, not to enforce the metrics and standards, but to enforce the statutory preference requirement, which is not challenged here, which was not written by Amtrak, and which would be enforced by the Surface Transportation Board in an independent adjudication in which they would take evidence from both sides and determine what the real story was."
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1332.886,1335.103,"--Can -- can I go back to my question, okay?"
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1340.89,1341.275,--I--
2014.13-1080,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1341.275,1343.009,If -- if it gets--
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1343.009,1364.155,"--That depends, Justice Sotomayor, on -- on the answer to what I said is an unresolved question about whether the 80 percent on-time performance trigger at the beginning of 24308(f)(1) is -- is read as being confines to the on-time performance metrics and standards that were adopted under PRIIA or whether that can be a reference to a pre-PRIIA, on-time performance metric."
2014.13-1080,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.294,1376.046,So doesn't this show something?
2014.13-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.659,1451.611,"Wow, I didn't mean that."
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1453.463,1469.822,"--To the extent that Justice Scalia also doesn't see a nondelegation problem in Carter Coal, then I -- I take it you are agreeing, but I think here that -- that the criminal sentencing context may present different issues."
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.758,1501.727,I think it was the Respondent's brief in which they gave the hypothetical.
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1513.901,1515.636,I take the point that that seems wrong.
2014.13-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.76,1531.862,Suppose Congress put that in place?
2014.13-1080,0,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1538.016,1549.99,"--I think that that would -- without the federal agreement that we also have here, the federal railroad administration contemporaneous agreement with the standards, that would present non delegation problems."
2014.13-1080,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.09,1552.775,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1560.296,1563.998,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.886,1596.302,What do you do about--
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.302,1599.338,"That's the big problem here, regulatory authority."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1615.7,1620.92,"Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think it's quite correct to say all it does is enable an investigation."
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1635.429,1638.731,"Well, but to the extent practicable, I mean, what does that mean?"
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1638.731,1641.849,"Well, unless it's a null set, Justice Kagan, it has to mean something."
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.051,1654.424,So instead you want a rule that lets the STB investigate even when you have one failure to accommodate?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1654.424,1659.293,"--Well, I'm not sure that's the rule we want, Justice Sotomayor, but at least that would have the merit--"
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.293,1659.995,But you would prefer that?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1659.995,1663.197,"--Well, it would at least have the merit of being constitutional."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.92,1682.508,Just like the Department of Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave Icon the power to write standards for the internet.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1682.508,1685.962,"--Well, and, Justice Breyer, let me address your concern head on."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.001,1696.951,I'm not saying it's a dire consequence.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1701.222,1705.874,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I can make a few points in response."
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.565,1756.122,"--But if the government agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak proposes, the government's assent is essential to this scheme, right?"
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1756.122,1757.722,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.184,1796.026,"You don't have to answer this question, but have you thought through what this means -- what I think is called the Baal conference where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting together to determine what they are going to do about interest rates, money supplied, et cetera."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1800.58,1801.313,--Very good.
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1801.313,1815.757,"Well, but then, how do you -- do you say that we were just plain wrong when we let the tobacco industry and milk producers veto regulations in our two prior cases Currin and Rock Royal?"
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1815.757,1822.762,"Yes, the difference in those cases, Justice Sotomayor, is that in those cases it was a federal government that drafted the regulation."
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.74,1844.192,That's -- that line is too thin for me.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1870.993,1875.295,"--Well, for one thing my clients, the regulated parties, were not given a say in this."
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1877.997,1878.463,That's the due process.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1878.463,1879.432,--Fair enough.
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1880.698,1881.632,And that's fair enough by the way.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1889.371,1908.532,"--With regard to Your Honor's earlier point about that being a thin line, I understand that but at the same time that is the line, the precise line that this Court explicitly drew both in Curran and in J.W. Hampton where it said that allowing this vote of the regulated parties, that doesn't amount to legislative action."
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1912.319,1918.74,--I don't know what they meant because they were subjecting themselves to standards.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1918.74,1924.227,"Well, and I would simply go back to our point that we never had a vote in this process."
2014.13-1080,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1924.227,1940.32,What do you make of the provision to which you referred earlier that says that the metrics and standards shall be incorporated into the operating agreements to the greatest extent practicable or to the extent practicable.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1953.996,1975.494,"Well, Justice Alito, I think in that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and the freight railroad could not reach agreement and therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach terms and proscribe the terms of the operating agreement."
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2028.628,2029.944,Do you think that's dispositive?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2036.134,2040.352,"I'm not so sure I would go so far as to say it's dispositive, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.484,2066.836,And not look at the animal as it exists?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2091.802,2092.321,--I agree.
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2109.13,2113.65,"Well, the post office is supposed to be a for-profit corporation, too, to the same extent, right?"
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2113.65,2125.875,"--Well, yes, Justice Kagan, keep in mind the post office is expressly created as a federal entity, it's in our Constitution and in Federal statutory law it says the post office is an agency or an entity within the executive branch."
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2125.875,2127.394,But then that all goes back to labels.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2132.279,2133.295,Well--
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2133.295,2151.941,"Subject to the policy control of Congress, which Congress exercises pretty much on a routine basis, it's entirely funded by Congress, all the members of the board are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, save the -- save one."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2158.677,2161.779,"--Well, first, I would take issue with just the label."
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2201.289,2201.773,Yes.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2202.639,2215.099,"--Well, it rejected the ultimate constitutional conclusion for purposes of the First Amendment claim, but I don't think this Court took issue with the fact that Amtrak's officers and directors have said from day one very publicly that we don't govern in any sense."
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.437,2245.452,"So for -- I mean, for that purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating on a for-profit basis and is giving -- is given the last word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its competitors, there's a violation of due process."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2250.17,2254.141,"Justice Scalia, I certainly agree a hundred percent with you on the due process point."
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.039,2286.195,The due process question wasn't -- the due process question wasn't aired below at all; isn't that so?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2286.195,2287.512,"It was aired below, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2313.43,2315.381,And not decided by the D.C. Circuit.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2315.381,2316.899,I beg your pardon?
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.899,2318.433,And not decided--
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2318.433,2318.9,That's correct.
2014.13-1080,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.9,2321.202,--because the D.C. Circuit went on a delegation.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2321.202,2322.185,That's correct.
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2342.282,2349.37,So are you attacking the statute that says that competitors have to accommodate Amtrak?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2354.44,2356.24,"It's not, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1080,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2361.01,2370.216,But the -- but the investigation is only going to determine whether you violated the statute's failure to accommodate Amtrak.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2370.216,2372.485,"I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.495,2389.93,Can the government -- what is the due process violation?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2425.286,2432.19,"Well, if I'm understanding Your Honor's hypothetical, it doesn't sound like it because you have a situation where it's the government that's prescribing the regulations."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.19,2432.574,No.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2445.014,2445.866,Right.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.449,2448.885,"Well, I just described it now."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2448.885,2449.318,--Right.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.318,2457.157,They have broad authority but they have to meet certain energy-efficient mandates and they can prescribe standards and so forth that will allow them to do it.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2463.228,2469.399,"If -- when you say “ prescribe standards ”, it would pose a problem if the standards they're prescribing apply to others in the industry."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.267,2473.601,It applies.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2483.558,2485.708,--That doesn't sound like a due process violation.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2485.708,2487.443,Then what is your violation here?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2489.11,2491.562,The violation here is that Congress has given Amtrak the pen.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.562,2492.212,--The what?
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2492.212,2492.93,The pen.
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.43,2499.234,You have to posit that the energy department manufactures bulbs.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2499.234,2500.101,No.
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.101,2505.822,And that it keeps the profit from the bulbs on its own.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2521.831,2530.872,"Well -- and if that's the situation where the government is both acting in the marketplace as a commercial actor and as a regulator of the industry, that's a problem."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.43,2554.671,"That's what I was -- I'm trying to get at -- I started with the statement, I think, that due process -- your argument -- it didn't matter whether you called them private or public; am I right?"
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2554.671,2555.888,--That's right.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.888,2556.355,Okay.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2580.972,2597.665,"Well, that -- I think that might be a violation of due process because in that situation what happens is that the Department of Energy is giving authority to private corporations to set rules, standards that govern the conduct of other private corporations."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.665,2599.617,It will hurt the other private organizations.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2599.617,2599.967,Right.
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.967,2612.857,My reaction was the way you deal with that normally is the statute would be interpreted not to give them the authority to write anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under the antitrust laws.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2638.625,2648.347,"Well, Justice Breyer, I do believe that this Court on multiple occasions subsequent to the Lochner era has reaffirmed the core holding of Carter Coal about delegations to private parties are forbidden."
2014.13-1080,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.851,2658.388,"But your due process, I want some authority for your due process point on the private agencies."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2658.388,2663.107,"--Well, our -- the foundational case we have for due process in this context is Carter Coal."
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.078,2702.934,"Well, he said the metrics and standards for the first time made it realistic that there would be enforcement of that requirement."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2702.934,2714.909,"Well, first, I would say if that's true, that, to me, strikes me as a pretty plain regulatory effect in that the metrics and standards are on the books and the freight railroads know that they now need to comply or they're going to face enforcement actions."
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.642,2715.992,No.
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2719.127,2720.813,--You can allow a private party--
2014.13-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.813,2725.28,"I mean, even if they just said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak requests it."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2727.566,2737.59,"--I agree, Justice Scalia, but at the same time the problem here is that Congress has given Amtrak the power to define the terms and to draft the regulations in which it may bring an enforcement action."
2014.13-1080,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2737.84,2776.046,"Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way to look at this on the delegation question, not on the due process question but on the delegation question, is that there is government all over this at every step, that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself, no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that even those metrics and standards are useless unless the Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the preference requirement."
2014.13-1080,1,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2784.219,2799.329,"--Well, I -- I take the point that the FRA is involved in the development of the standards, but I don't think it follows from -- from that premise to say that Congress can give a private company and the Federal government joint ownership of the pen in drafting the regulations."
2014.13-1080,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.152,2835.254,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2837.954,2840.239,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.331,2880.199,Would you talk about the contract provision?
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2880.199,2881.449,"Yes, we should have--"
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.449,2885.017,You should have raised that in your -- I should have raised it in your principal.
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2885.017,2893.121,--We think that the contract's provisions are -- the statutory provision there in 207 does require the contracts to be incorporated to the extent practicable.
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.495,2907.797,"But if they can't come to an agreement, who decides what the contract--"
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2907.797,2914.451,"--As Mr. Dupree said, that the -- then the dispute goes before the surface transportation board, it's in 24308--"
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.451,2915.87,--And the STB--
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2915.87,2919.505,"--Will determine what are, quote, “ reasonable terms and conditions ”."
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.505,2930.646,"--Which would include -- which would include the requirement that, to the extent practicable, the standards set forth by Amtrak be followed."
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2930.646,2937.216,But we -- we don't think that that requires they be -- they are not things that would be binding on the freight railroads.
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.428,2965.735,"Well, as -- as your friend said, to the extent practicable, unless the whole thing is nugatory, certainly does not wash out the whole provision."
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2965.735,2966.552,"--Well, I think that--"
2014.13-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.552,2967.552,It must have some bite.
2014.13-1080,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2969.387,2993.82,"--I think it was to encourage the parties to ensure that they are now collecting data in systematic ways, that they can nationalize things, that -- that they now measure things in the same fashion, they use minutes instead of seconds or whatever, and also that there are some parts of the metrics and standards that wouldn't make sense to go in the contracts at all, things that have to do with customer service surveys about -- satisfaction surveys about the cleanliness of the cars."
2014.13-1080,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.024,3103.874,"Thank you, counsel."
