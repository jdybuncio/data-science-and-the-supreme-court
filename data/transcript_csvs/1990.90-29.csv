1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.942,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-29, James C. Pledger v. Daniel Medlock, and 90-38, Daniel Medlock v. James C. Pleasure... Pledger, I'm sorry."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,18.012,23.167,"Mr. Chief Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.495,191.226,"The Supreme Court of Arkansas, Mr. Keadle, said that the tax was invalid insofar as it applied to cable TV operators but did not extend to satellite dish operators?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,191.226,193.718,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.718,194.719,And you're appealing--
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,194.719,196.9,That is the issue that the State is appealing.
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.9,198.39,--You're appealing that ruling?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,209.698,210.469,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,210.469,216.373,Is the satellite issue still in the case?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,216.373,217.925,"Well, Your Honor, the--"
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,217.925,219.017,The law has been amended?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,219.017,219.886,"--Yes, it has."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,225.332,225.669,I see.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,225.669,227.872,"--upholding the tax, the law was changed."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,228.982,234.207,But you would still like to argue that it was not invalid prior to amendment?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,234.207,234.685,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.496,235.796,Okay.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,235.796,239.529,"--somehow inconsistent, but the basis of our argument is--"
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.529,243.14,"The legislature might go back, if you want."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,243.14,270.6,"--Well, that could well happen, but, Your Honor, we are arguing that the tax as it stood in 1987 was constitutional due to the fact that, although evidence was presented that these two media provided similar types of services, that there was a difference in the two media that would justify the different, different tax treatment."
1990.90-29,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,270.6,275.701,"How much is involved in that interim period, between 1987 and 1989?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,275.701,284.727,"Between 1987 and 1989, at the time the taxes were escrowed in the case it was approximately $6.2 million."
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.92,334.73,"And if this Court were to reverse the Supreme Court of Arkansas and say that the statute in effect before the legislative amendment went into effect was constitutional, the State would recover some money, then?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,334.73,341.256,"Well, Your Honor, it is not a true escrow in that sense."
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.842,351.343,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,358.936,359.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.979,392.219,"Well, is that because they don't compete?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,392.219,399.582,"--Well, Your Honor, in some sense they do compete for viewer dollars, consumer dollars."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.83,412.692,"Well, I suppose we can tell when... you can read a newspaper, and you watch a television screen."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,436.838,450.837,"--Your Honor, I think it's clear that in fact evidence presented at the trial showed that many of the types of programs that cable offered were indeed similar to those provided by newspaper."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.206,468.839,"Well, but didn't the Arkansas Supreme Court say that there was no competition between the two, or am I wrong about that?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,474.593,476.382,--That is between cable and newspaper?
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.382,477.003,Yes.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,477.003,477.584,Yes.
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.248,486.14,Was that based on some factual findings?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,486.14,505.732,"Well, I think it was more a review of past cases of this Court that had not necessarily made the distinction between cable and newspapers as being competing interests, even though, even though the evidence presented was they are similar types of programs."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.766,515.359,"Mr. Keadle, what, what is your theory of the law?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,539.465,541.155,"--Your Honor, I don't think the basis--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.155,542.056,--proposition you accept?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,542.056,548.732,"--No, I don't believe it's whether the two are competing necessarily."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.443,552.395,"Well, what is it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,552.395,553.273,--other aspects have to be looked at.
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.273,554.355,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,560.499,573.218,"Well, the criterion that the State is arguing and that we're looking at is the type of burden that is placed on the Government by the two types of services."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.579,593.871,"Well, that's a difference between the two, and there are a lot of other differences between the two."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,603.546,604.047,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.5,626.693,So it's just the same test that applies to all taxation?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,632.757,638.628,"That's correct, and I believe this Court's decision in another Arkansas case, the Writer's Project case--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.628,643.854,"Yes, but what about a tax on ink and typesetting?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,643.854,680.356,"--Your Honor, I believe this Court has also stated that an effect on a newspaper, that particular... that particular example in the Minneapolis Star case, that when you examine it and see that the effect is had only on a few members of the press, in that case a small group, a use tax on publishers, rather that it was shown--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.356,684.409,"Yeah, but surely there was a rational basis to distinguish publishers from other people."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,698.789,700.499,"--Your Honor, I believe there was a rational basis there--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.499,702.952,But we struck it down anyway.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,702.952,710.016,--The Court struck it down because the tax in effect targeted a small group within one entity.
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.016,714.82,In other words a group within an entity that was competing with each other.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,716.241,717.312,"Well, in effect it was the same entity."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.312,718.21,Pardon?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,718.21,721.014,"It was the same entity, as opposed to competing entities."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.014,723.706,The same as opposed to competing?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,725.256,726.798,The same in the sense that--
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.798,728.658,They're different newspapers.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,728.658,729.679,--the tax was on publishers.
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.04,754.305,"So in one-half of the case it depends on whether scrambled television systems are really the same media as unscrambled television systems, is that's your criterion, right?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,759.637,787.777,"Well, Your Honor, I believe in that situation you can actually distinguish between the satellite service and the cable TV service in that... in that basically the way the program is received in the home, in one instance, satellite service, can be distinguished from cable."
1990.90-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.241,814.775,"May I ask, don't the newspapers use public property to sell their newspapers?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,814.775,819.588,"--Yes, Your Honor, to some extent that is true."
1990.90-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.588,821.33,Then how... what happens to your distinction?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,821.33,826.072,"Well, I believe the distinction is still there."
1990.90-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.241,840.641,"Of course they pay for the franchises, don't they?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,840.641,851.908,"--Well, Your Honor, it's true there is some payment for the franchise, but I don't think it's clear also that that is necessarily full compensation for that service."
1990.90-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.908,855.251,But isn't it true the newspapers don't pay anything for the newsstands on public property?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,855.251,873.493,"That's true, Your Honor, and that may... and the distinction there may well be more of a basis upon how administratively easy it is to collect the tax from newspapers as opposed to cable."
1990.90-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.332,911.098,"Yeah, but administration of a sales tax on newspapers probably isn't any harder than sales tax on candy bars, is it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,911.098,914.981,"Your Honor, that may well be true."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.368,950.414,"In Arkansas, what do... what public property does the... do the cable companies use?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,950.414,960.241,"Well, in effect they use both, both the wires, the wires and underground conduits."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.813,983.405,Do they use telephone poles?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,983.405,983.876,--Yes.
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.821,1001.488,Did the Arkansas Supreme Court find that cable television pays a franchise fee for the use of the public right-of-way?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1001.488,1005.669,"Your Honor, I believe that--"
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1005.669,1009.232,I thought that was included in their findings?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1009.232,1032.175,"--Your Honor, that was indeed mentioned in the findings, but I would submit that that finding is not completely correct, given the fact that this Court in the Preferred Communications case has at least sent that case back down for more evidence on how that fee is collected and how it is used."
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1032.175,1035.249,"So you don't support the opinion of the court below on that point, is that it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1035.249,1048.558,"Your Honor, I believe that the evidence that we have can allow us to make a decision without necessarily addressing that portion."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.196,1086.302,"Mr. Keadle, I suppose the State of Arkansas can impose a tax on candy and not impose a tax on ice cream if it wanted to, couldn't it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1086.302,1088.944,"Your Honor, I would think so."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.944,1096.608,And you wouldn't have to show that candy used public facilities or the public streets more than ice cream or anything of that sort?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1096.608,1097.76,"No, Your Honor, I think--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.76,1101.503,"You'd just come up here and you'd say candy is different from ice cream, right?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1101.503,1102.842,"--Well, Your Honor, the--"
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.842,1110.078,So why... what you're saying today is that cable is different from scrambled... un... you know--
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1110.078,1125.797,"--Well, the difference in the two examples, one being the candy and the other being the difference between cable and newspaper and cable and scrambled satellite services is to what extent the respondents' First Amendment rights are being violated."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.797,1130.2,"--Well, I understand, but what I don't get from you, what I don't understand is what your theory is."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1137.574,1138.506,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1990.90-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.506,1148.744,"Well, if it's not a compelling State interest that has to be shown, what must be shown beyond what has to be shown in the candy and ice cream illustration?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1153.786,1168.225,"Your Honor, I believe on one hand this Court has recognized that the need for the State to raise revenue is a rational basis for making any decision to tax a certain subject."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.225,1175.842,"Well, on that instance I suppose you could have taxed the press and exempted cable?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1175.842,1176.91,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1191.701,1216.147,"I thought there was language in some of our opinions that when a tax is placed on the media in what appears to be some discriminatory fashion, that the State has to come up with a strong State interest for making that differential tax."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1216.147,1216.798,"Well, Your Honor, that--"
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.798,1222.292,"Is that right, that there's some heightened scrutiny when the First Amendment is involved?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1222.292,1235.709,"--Well, Your Honor, that does bring to mind the O'Brien case that in effect stated that the interest should be... should be important or substantial."
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.944,1246.737,How about Arkansas Writers and Minneapolis Star?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1252.609,1268.03,"--Yes, Your Honor, I feel that that was suggested in a case where, as in Arkansas, that, that interest was needed to justify a content based discrimination."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.217,1281.29,"But it's also a State sales tax, isn't it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1281.29,1282.389,"Yes, Your Honor, it's applied to--"
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.389,1285.302,"That applies not just to the press, I mean not just to the media--"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1285.302,1286.994,"--Oh, it applies to all similarly situated businesses."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.994,1287.505,--Yes.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1287.505,1292.356,"The newspaper, in effect, is part of a limited number of exemptions."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.356,1292.796,Exactly.
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1292.796,1294.447,And the fact that--
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.447,1299.8,So the real issue is whether you can distinguish between one form of communication and another?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1299.8,1303.544,"--Yes, Your Honor, I feel it's very clear here that not only is that content based--"
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1303.544,1309.377,"Now, sales of newspapers and magazines sold by subscription are exempt?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1309.377,1310.539,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1310.539,1316.453,"And cable services are generally sold by subscription, I take it?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1316.453,1319.144,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, too."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.144,1326.358,Could the State tax magazine subscriptions and not newspapers?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1326.358,1337.937,"Your Honor, I believe that that would be within the State's province to do, again subject to a challenge on why it was done."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.937,1339.547,On the grounds that we say they're different?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1339.547,1344.079,"Well, that would be the first argument."
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.477,1359.8,Suppose we show... suppose it is shown that they compete for the same consumer dollar?
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1363.984,1364.723,"--Your Honor, I don't--"
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.723,1368.827,"Would that have a bearing on whether or not they are different, or is that just something we don't look to?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1368.827,1370.279,--Your Honor--
1990.90-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.279,1377.832,"We look to some metaphysical difference between newspapers and magazines, and metaphysical difference is fairly easy to establish, I suppose."
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1377.832,1381.746,"--Your Honor, I think that would have a bearing on the matter, again."
1990.90-29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.882,1406.942,"What's the... in the cases, what is the standard that has been applied that, sustaining the right of localities to license cable operators but to exempt newspapers from license?"
1990.90-29,0,45206,william_e_keadle,,1409.542,1426.683,"Your Honor, I believe that in effect is a higher point, too, when you're looking at a regulatory... well, in fact taxation, too, is a regulatory form of restriction."
1990.90-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.387,1449.039,"Very well, Mr. Keadle."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1450.989,1462.168,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.116,1697.852,"Well, I see that in your brief you refer to cases since Minneapolis Star, and you say, these courts have held that unless there is some logical reason for distinguishing between different segments of the mass communications media, cable television services should enjoy the same First Amendment rights."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1699.612,1701.442,"Well, the... it's a compelling."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.744,1706.147,You mean logical is at least compelling?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1706.147,1722.506,"--Well, what I'm... Mr. White, if I have stated... there is no logical distinction between the two inasmuch as they are transmitting and conveying to the public the same type of information."
1990.90-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.552,1778.303,"Mr. Sayre, if you say that a compelling State interest is required in order to have a tax that distinguishes between types of media, you're going from what was the standard before Minneapolis Star, which was that any rational basis would support a tax distinction, you know, Lenhouse v.... and those cases, that that was where the latitude awarded to the Government was the greatest, to a situation where the Government can virtually never prevail."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1782.707,1788.75,"If there is a differential in taxation, Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that is probably the case."
1990.90-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.923,1809.956,Well why would it be so limited?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1824.584,1838.253,"We don't... I was going to say have that situation in this case, but I would say that that argument certainly could be made by the bookstore operator with regard to what he was selling to the public."
1990.90-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.355,1859.667,What about telephone services?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1880.911,1891.318,"--Justice Kennedy, I would say that, again, as the Chief Justice, that is an argument that the telephone companies could raise, whether it is--"
1990.90-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.318,1895.592,"Well, we have to write the opinion, and we want to know the consequences of the theory that you're advancing."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1897.722,1898.894,--The consequences would be--
1990.90-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.894,1906.057,It seems to me the consequences are they're engaged in dissemination of information and that they qualify for the exemption.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1906.057,1917.974,"--And they are... in the case of when they're acting other than a common carrier, and they are originating the information, they probably have that same constitutional right."
1990.90-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1917.974,1933.887,"Because I can think of no case in which we... in which a State has been able to show a compelling interest, of course we have never asked them to do so, but I can't think of how a State could show a compelling interest to justify any tax exemption or any tax discrimination."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1933.887,1957.531,"The situation that I think, Mr. Kennedy, that this case presents is exactly the one that was left open in the Arkansas Writer's Project case, and that is that in the instance, in the first part, the 1987 to 1989 part of this case, that being when the direct broadcast satellite services were not taxed."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.323,1979.264,That was on the basis of the subject matter of the magazines.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,1983.317,2002.781,"--Then, Mr. Scalia, with regard to the part that was reserved in Justice Marshall's decision in that case, of whether or not the difference between... taxation between periodicals would be an additional basis... was reserved, and I think that is exactly what is presented in this case."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.659,2079.891,"Does it constitute an unconstitutional discrimination that has to have a compelling justification if the type of tax at issue, although it's applied uniformly to anyone, is simply a tax that does not happen to fall on one of the media?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2117.216,2125.202,"In the particular instance here, the sale, I mean, the sales tax is imposed as an excise tax on the sale."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.202,2125.921,"--No, I understand that--"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2125.921,2131.014,So I think that would be a distinction that would be drawn.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.014,2136.09,"--No, but I'm trying to test the breadth of the principle you're urging us to adopt."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2155.751,2167.018,"I would think, in response, Mr. Scalia, that it would have to apply generally, and that is what this Court's admonitions in Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writer's meant to say."
1990.90-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.018,2169.339,"Mr. Sayre, the members of the Court should be addressed as Justice."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2169.339,2170.821,"Excuse me, Chief Justice."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.914,2223.005,"But Mr. Sayre, I think... I'm really not sure you're answering Justice Scalia."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2234.852,2241.747,"I do not believe it would, because I believe that the newspapers stand in the same strike that cable would."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.747,2242.578,Thank you.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2242.578,2270.906,The... this Court in the application of the First Amendment rights of the press and speech to cable TV treated it as a passive receiver in the 1960's and 1970's.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.943,2348.547,But the discrimination is not... there's no discrimination between cable and other retail businesses?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2348.547,2349.328,"No, there is not."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.819,2374.144,"So I suppose the State, in your view, could solve the problem either way, by extending the tax or exempting cable?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2374.144,2375.716,--That is correct.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.159,2387.905,Would they need some kind of a compelling interest to include all of the media in the sales tax?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2387.905,2389.043,No.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.756,2423.198,And why should the exemption of the press be subject to... the exemption of newspapers be subject to a compelling interest if taxing all of the press would not require a compelling interest?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2423.198,2443.229,"Because of, as this Court stated in the Minneapolis Star case, it offers the incentive for the legislature to act as a carrot and a stick, to play one media off against the other, to offer if you change your viewpoint we'll take the tax off or we'll exempt you."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.568,2464.712,Do you think the congressional decision to subject cable to licensing is constitutional?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2464.712,2470.258,"--With regard to the First Amendment, as when newspapers are not subjected to--"
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.258,2470.736,"No, no."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2471.437,2480.295,"--Acting under the Commerce Clause, the Congress can generally exercise any power over--"
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.295,2480.513,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2480.513,2481.464,--So--
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.464,2486.019,How about is it constitutional... does the First Amendment interfere with that decision by Congress?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2486.019,2502.338,"--A number of courts have indicated that exclusive franchising, it does, because that there ought to be more than one speaker, that there's no reason... no logical or compelling reason to limit it."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.191,2516.187,"Well, do you think Congress really needed to demonstrate a compelling interest to subject cable to licensing but not newspapers?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2516.187,2527.016,"But... well, Your Honor, I think they perhaps have shown the compelling interest, and that being the licensing of the franchises--"
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.016,2527.667,What are they?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2527.667,2530.028,--The licensing and franchising of the use of the public property.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.028,2531.397,What is the compelling interest?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2531.397,2539.922,"The... again, the predominant use or continued use of the public right-of-ways in that instance is one that--"
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.922,2545.826,But you don't think applying the sales tax can be justified as a... on that basis?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2545.826,2546.637,--Not on that basis.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.637,2547.118,Why not?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2547.118,2552.23,Because there is... it has no logical connection with it.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.394,2583.971,"Mr. Sayre, suppose a State says, suppose we come out the way you want and the State says gee, we can't tax these media differentially."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2593.728,2604.925,The subsidation would probably bring into consideration this Court's decision in Reagan v. Taxpayers with Representation.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.133,2616.762,It isn't?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2643.43,2673.54,"--Well, the... I think the real difference would be, in those particular instances of public television and public radio that are being funded, they, in the commercial sense that they could not attract enough to provide that type of programming and the access is one that the State is trying to get a broader and a further discussion of public issues of... and as the Court said, of Government, being those that are the most important."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.54,2674.761,You're saying the State has a good reason.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2689.652,2690.491,"Yes, I do."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.491,2703.27,"So it's all right for the municipalities in Arkansas to permit the use of sidewalks, public sidewalks, for news boxes without charge?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2706.632,2708.011,That would be a subsidy.
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.011,2709.504,And a permissible one?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2709.504,2722.082,"A permissible one, but I think that it's also one that they probably could charge a minimal amount to State for whatever use of the public right-of-way that's being made."
1990.90-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.082,2723.213,But they don't.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2724.765,2725.503,They do.
1990.90-29,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2725.503,2736.022,"Mr. Sayre, in your response to one of Justice Scalia's inquiries, you spoke of Reagan against TWA... TWR."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2736.022,2736.693,Yes.
1990.90-29,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2736.693,2742.636,That case is mentioned by one or two of the amicus curiae.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2752.7,2764.619,"It would, Justice Blackmun, with the exception that again I think it deals with the entity... or the instance of a subsidy as opposed to the direct speaking."
1990.90-29,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2803.946,2815.052,"Well, the amici were certainly sufficiently concerned to try to spar that... the holding in that case, but evidently neither you nor your... opposing counsel was concerned about it."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2815.052,2836.576,"--I would simply say that this... what I have stated to distinguish it I believe is sufficient, that it is not in the same line as the Minneapolis Star or Arkansas Writer's Project type of case that is attacked... or, excuse me, review of the First Amendment application to the delivery of the... or direct delivery of the message."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.576,2845.683,"Mr. Sayre, could Arkansas exempt not-for-profit organizations from its sales tax?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2850.315,2850.626,"Well, it does."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.626,2851.137,--It does?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2851.137,2853.871,It does exempt not-for-profit organizations.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.324,2858.205,"Well, why is that all right?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2858.205,2866.09,In the sense of... most of those aren't selling any type of newspaper.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.083,2874.487,"Well, they're selling the newspaper, but what they get from it just covers their costs of production."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2877.161,2888.499,--The basic principle for the exemption of any charitable organization is they're supplying a service or some need that the State would otherwise have to supply.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.149,2891.1,That's a compelling State interest?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2891.1,2908.851,"--That would be a consideration of a compelling State interest, but that is what I'm stating is the reason that the courts in Arkansas at least have held that the tax-exempt or charitable organizations may be exempt from tax."
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.851,2912.704,Why doesn't that offend the principle of freedom of the press?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2918.468,2919.257,--That's correct.
1990.90-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.257,2920.158,It's to ensure open discussion.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,2925.712,2948.478,"Well, in this particular instance I would say it would simply be the delivery of... if it's the message of, again, not a general interest but simply the charitable organization's organ of dissemination of information to its members or its supporters that is a confined and limited purpose, it perhaps is sufficient to rise to a compelling need."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.329,3046.432,May I ask you a question just running through my mind as a result of one the Chief Justice asked you?
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,3056.83,3069.026,"That would certainly be subject to question, and I think that the theater owners would have, with regard to their particular type of communication, a valid claim that there is a discrimination."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.854,3084.256,So tax on the... I'm talking about theaters exhibiting motion pictures.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,3084.256,3084.717,"Theaters, yes."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.717,3085.187,I see.
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,3085.187,3090.401,"But, Justice Stevens, in Arkansas the theaters are taxed and cable is taxed."
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.135,3106.101,"I understand, but I think your distinction... I mean your argument that the press and cable TV are similarly protected would apply equally to cable TV and motion picture theaters."
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,3106.101,3107.932,--Yes.
1990.90-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.932,3110.272,"And you can think of no compelling interest, can you, for that distinction?"
1990.90-29,1,23176,eugene_g_sayre,,3110.272,3111.244,"No, I cannot."
1990.90-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.718,3163.798,"Thank you, Mr. Sayre."
1990.90-29,2,45206,william_e_keadle,,3167.171,3172.364,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-29,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.994,3241.66,"Well, arguably, I suppose the, changing the law made the exemption of newspapers even more difficult, because satellites don't use the... a satellite doesn't use... don't use the streets and put any burden on the public like the... like the cable operators do."
1990.90-29,2,45206,william_e_keadle,,3241.66,3243.36,--Your Honor--
