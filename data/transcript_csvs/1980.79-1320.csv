1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.061,We will hear arguments next in Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,69.191,73.331,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.469,120.359,"As a matter of fact, this is your sole argument here, isn't it, Mr. Schantz?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,121.529,122.763,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,242.231,254.038,"Mr. Solicitor, suppose Iowa made a rule of difference as to whether it was raining or snowing, because there is a difference?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,254.038,255.538,That's correct.
1980.79-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,255.538,268.032,"It doesn't make too much difference how long a truck is in sunny weather, but in rainy weather it does make a difference, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,268.032,277.482,"We think it does make a difference in sunny weather too, but one of the more critical differences certainly is when the roads are bad, and they are frequently bad in Iowa."
1980.79-1320,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.482,279.263,And when visibility is bad.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,279.263,280.029,Exactly.
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,296.084,311.171,"Do you think then that... let's take the State of Wyoming or Colorado or some of the states with mountains and curved highways and steep, could have a shorter length than even Iowa?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,311.171,315.732,Mr. Chief Justice--
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,315.732,319.105,"Let's say, just five feet, not... five feet shorter?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,322.292,324.136,"--I think they could, within reason."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,324.136,327.836,"I mean, they couldn't say, no trailer trucks at all, could they?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,327.836,330.162,No twin-trailer trucks at all?
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,358.355,369.522,What would you say about Iowa's right to fix a 50-miles-an-hour speed limit when Nebraska and all the contiguous states were 60 miles an hour?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,369.522,371.677,We would strenuously argue that Iowa has that authority.
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,371.677,373.365,What if they dropped it down to 20 miles an hour?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,373.365,386.063,"Well, with all line-drawing problems, as Justice Holmes, the quote in our brief from Louisville Gas and Electric, at some point it may be that a court should say that it's not--"
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,386.063,392.201,"That would be an undue burden, you would say, on interstate commerce, to say 20 miles an hour is the limit for trucks?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,392.201,396.105,--I would not characterize it that way.
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.02,416.706,I don't understand that.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,433.683,437.433,"I think if they truly did it consistently, Your Honor, they could--"
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.433,439.54,"Well, presumably they would if they had a 20-mile-an-hour speed limit and everybody obeyed it."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,439.54,441.494,--If they had a 20-mile-an-hour speed limit--
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.494,449.566,And I don't understand why you can't make the same argument on a 25-foot truck length too.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,453.454,454.66,"--I think that's probably correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.66,458.158,"Well, can't the state just adopt a 25-foot truck length?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,458.83,459.954,"Well, I would be--"
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.954,462.968,"It has safety, it certainly has safety concerns associated with it."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,462.968,463.39,--That's correct.
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.046,481.493,"Certainly one reason you might not want to adopt it is that trucks would in that event avoid Iowa, and Iowa merchants and so forth get profit from trucks of 55-foot length coming through Iowa."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,489.115,496.455,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I think that reveals an important point about what's going on in this kind of line-drawing."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.794,511.902,"that has echoes of the recent ""benzene"" case, does it not?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,511.902,517.119,"I can't address myself to that, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.119,520.759,"Well, what... let's hear it test it out further."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,560.446,562.445,Let me say two things.
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.227,600.43,"Do you really want to add, ""at what cost""?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,612.003,622.343,"--No, to be clear, I think any safety regulation could be stricter, or a state could invest more resources."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.343,625.234,So you think there has to be a cost... at what cost?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,626.327,628.264,"Yes, I do."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.264,638.308,"You mean, in short, the safety, the burdens of the safety... the burdens that safety imposes could be too much burden?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,638.308,653.659,"On the contrary, Your Honor, it is just because it is a policy question of how much safety at what cost, that we believe this Court should leave that question to a legislature."
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.763,680.478,"But Mr. Schantz, before you get to Congress, could the State ever be terribly wrong if it had an expert who was willing to get on the witness stand and say, I think there is a probability that this different regulation will save one human life?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,690.129,691.114,That's right.
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.114,693.722,Are you asking us to overrule the Wisconsin case?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,693.722,697.423,"No, we're not, Your Honor, for two reasons."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.212,723.85,"Well, there was a two-week trial in this case, wasn't there, before Judge Stewart?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,723.85,727.083,"Yes, and a very long period of depositions, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,727.083,737.641,"Perhaps it's irrelevant, but does the right to travel possibly enter into this total picture?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,752.152,765.272,"Well, I think the right to travel cases, primarily, at least, involve the rights of persons to travel and not the right of carriers to transport--"
1980.79-1320,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.272,769.582,"But can a state say, if you want to travel through this state, you have to either walk or ride horseback?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,777.25,785.733,"--In principle, as silly as it sounds, I think as a matter of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that is not a bad position."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.027,808.504,"Well, to get to a more current issue, could Iowa ban all trucks which were carrying nuclear waste or hazardous waste from passing through it?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,808.504,821.998,"Not from passing through it, because I think that would be a direct, probably would be a direct regulation of interstate commerce, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.998,823.373,"Well, but it's a safety."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,825.325,832.401,"Yes, and I think the state can do a lot of things that are reasonable to restrict."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.401,842.24,"Well, I know, but a state here says, instead of saying all nuclear waste trucks stay out, all trucks over 60 feet stay out."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,842.24,845.082,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.082,846.035,"That's pretty direct, isn't it?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,846.035,849.691,"It's not a barrier in that sense, in that--"
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.691,855.735,"I'm afraid it is, that there are no trucks of that length allowed in the state, no matter what they're carrying."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,855.735,858.311,--But the nuclear waste would not get through.
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.888,865.698,"I know, but the trucks can't go."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,865.698,880.537,"--That particular truck can't go through, and if the limit were raised to 100 feet, Your Honor, that would still mean that a 108-foot truck can't go through, so I think we're still basically talking about a question of line-drawing by the Legislature."
1980.79-1320,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,932.079,933.827,Because the law provided what?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,933.827,942.762,"The law said, there was a general statute that said, that was referred to, that semis could operate at 55 feet without a permit."
1980.79-1320,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.753,964.799,Trains; trailer trains.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,966.829,971.578,Which was the regulation that applied to twin trailers or triples or how many ever additional you added on.
1980.79-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1031.46,1038.347,"Mr. Solicitor, you're going to comment and give us your assurance about your border cities exemption?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1038.347,1055.997,"Your Honor, the border cities exemption... the border cities provision... I don't want to quibble about words, but I'm not sure it's an exemption, it's a classification addressed to what we think is a different situation."
1980.79-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1055.997,1059.886,I asked that at this time because of your reference to the Raymond case and its structure.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1064.041,1070.273,We think that is another difference between this case and the Raymond case.
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.227,1129.905,"Well, counsel, following up on Justice Blackmun's question, Iowa is somewhat peculiarly situated with respect to border cities, isn't it, in that being bounded by the Mississippi on one side and the Missouri on the other, you have Dubuque, Clinton, Davenport, Keokuk, Fort Madison on the Mississippi side?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1130.452,1132.124,"Council Bluffs on the Missouri side, yes."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.124,1145.008,"Sioux City and Council Bluffs on the other, so that a remarkable percentage of the population lives in identifiable border cities."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1145.008,1153.88,"I don't think the record reflects that precisely, Your Honor, but that would by no means be a majority of the population of Iowa."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.174,1161.877,Compared to Wisconsin?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1161.877,1169.779,"I think more of the population in Wisconsin is inland; yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.779,1175.746,"Well, are other kinds of trucks permitted to exceed this length limit too?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1175.746,1178.901,"Yes, it doesn't have anything to do with twins versus semis."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.367,1190.928,The livestock trucks run all over the state.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1190.928,1197.394,"Sixty-foot livestock trucks, which is the same limitation for twin-trailers."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.096,1214.808,"While we're on geography, is it relevant to this case and the problems of the case that Iowa is something of a crossroads in a sense, at least one of the main crossroads for east-west traffic and north-south traffic?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1214.808,1229.647,"From Consolidated Freightways' point of view, frankly, I'm sure it is relevant, just as Pennsylvania being between Boston and New York on interstate highways."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.647,1237.237,"Iowa is pretty big to detour if you're going from Minnesota or Winnipeg down down to New Orleans, isn't it?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1237.237,1242.204,That's a significant... we would not suggest that's an insignificant detour.
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.704,1248.84,"Would you suggest, perhaps, it just relates to the pain that they're suffering, not to the constitutional issue?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1248.84,1250.184,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1276.924,1288.497,"Mr. Solicitor, did you argue the case in the 8th Circuit?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1288.497,1290.105,"No, I did not, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1290.105,1298.852,I wonder if you have any comment about Judge Henley's obvious suffering dubitante about the full crew law.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1298.852,1308.833,"We think that... well, perhaps that didn't completely describe our argument."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.595,1319.111,And he shouldn't just have been dubitante.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1319.111,1322.702,"We think it would have justified a full dissent, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.101,1426.458,"Suppose you read the opinion below as saying, well, we understand what the right standard is."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1453.291,1457.149,I think if Consolidated Freightways could demonstrate it.
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.149,1460.382,Is the Court permitted to go that far?
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1463.115,1464.38,Absolutely.
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.738,1480.875,"No, no, no; that no reasonable legislature could believe that its length limit is any safer than Missouri's."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1480.875,1486.387,That five feet makes a--
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.387,1487.37,Any difference.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1498.648,1501.32,"--Well, that was really the point I was addressing, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.895,1525.512,"I don't blame you for taking that tack, but here the Court did say that Iowa's limit as compared with Missouri's has no relation to safety."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1525.512,1535.774,"--The trial court said specifically, little if any difference, five feet of length."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.262,1567.151,"Well, are you just disagreeing with their judgment?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1572.509,1578.477,"They really asked the wrong question, and if you ask the right question, I think it's clear that a legislature could believe length is related to safety."
1980.79-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.477,1584.301,"Well, isn't it also clear that if you ask what you say is the right question the District Court would have come up the other way?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1596.531,1602.574,"That statement, Your Honor, plus the fact that the District Court called for preemption by Congress."
1980.79-1320,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.256,1626.597,"So, the Court shouldn't be able to ask if five feet makes any difference?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1626.597,1633.672,"Not five feet within a reasonable general range; no, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.103,1657.116,"Well, are you then saying that when it comes down to slicing it that thin, the phrase you used, then it's for a legislative body, not for a judicial body?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1657.116,1657.631,Exactly.
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.247,1684.245,"Mr. Schantz, I'm still a little troubled by your explanation of the Raymond case."
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1697.974,1702.239,It is the same kind of safety judgment.
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.774,1735.537,"But you would think they could reenact the same statute, just put a little different legislative history in and then they'd be okay?"
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1735.537,1738.693,"Well, no, because... not the same statute."
1980.79-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.734,1757.56,I don't know why they can't discriminate between twin-trailers and semis if they should happen to think one is safer than the other.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1757.56,1762.793,"Well, because... perhaps they could relitigate that point--"
1980.79-1320,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.793,1764.167,And if it's a rational judgment.
1980.79-1320,0,36699,mark_e_schantz,,1764.167,1766.198,--It has to be a rational judgment.
1980.79-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.814,1788.422,Very well.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,1789.094,1792.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1792.094,1816.661,"Let me... before it interrupts your line of argument... ask you this: suppose in an evidentiary hearing it developed that a significant number of accidents on the road by over-the-road trucks of whatever size, but the large ones, is the result of drivers going to sleep or otherwise having some problems."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,1832.359,1842.433,"--If in point of fact drivers falling asleep were causing accidents, I think that would be a perfectly legitimate state regulation."
1980.79-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1857.019,1861.362,"--Who decides whether in fact it promotes safety, the courts or the legislature?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,1861.362,1867.562,I think that is a factual determination that has to be made by the Court.
1980.79-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.828,1890.131,"Well, if the state says that 13 percent of the accidents occurred because of drivers going to sleep or other malfunctioning of the driving and therefore dual controls will protect that, does that bring it under the McGowan v. Maryland rational basis, or not, in your view?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,1890.131,1901.58,At this Court we're not dealing with the Equal Protection Clause and we're not dealing with the Fourteenth Amendment and due process.
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.041,1964.071,"Mr. Lederer, you say the record is conclusive."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2000.446,2004.758,--I think you have to draw a careful line between two things.
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.599,2056.408,"But Judge Stewart then, in effect, found against you, because he said the evidence in your favor was convincing but not overwhelming."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2056.408,2059.251,"Well, no, he didn't quite say ""not overwhelming""."
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.856,2078.571,"But there were witnesses from both sides and he had to pick one side or the other to believe, didn't he?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2078.571,2079.305,That's correct.
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.432,2121.819,"Well, I should think Consolidated would have its own bevy of witnesses that it could produce on these occasions too, to say that there's no effect on safety."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2121.819,2123.302,That's right.
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.097,2132.236,Does it try the statute literally?
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2134.688,2138.218,--I think there's a distinction that has to be made here between two types of statutes.
1980.79-1320,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2173.938,2174.829,Or having more vehicles on the road in Iowa.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2174.829,2181.232,"Or having more vehicles on the road in Iowa if, rather than running your twin trailers around the State, you choose to run semis through the State."
1980.79-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.609,2225.886,"Well, doesn't the Brotherhood case say that, that the district court has no authority to resolve evidentiary conclusions one way or the other against the judgment of the legislature?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2225.886,2229.228,To an extent the Brotherhood case does say that.
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.22,2299.03,Are you then defending squarely the Court of Appeals decision or not?
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2299.03,2299.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.92,2301.155,And its rationale?
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2301.155,2302.964,"Yes, I will--"
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.964,2305.339,"You're embroidering it a little bit, aren't you?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2305.339,2306.417,--I'm embroidering it a little bit.
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.352,2313.179,Yes.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2314.554,2316.35,"--Not in its full form, Your Honor."
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.35,2316.631,All right.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2337.467,2338.983,"No, I do not."
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.983,2361.082,"Well, then, how can you possibly say that no rational legislature could have decided that there was a safety factor involved here if the District Court on the evidence before it could have come out the other way and withstood an appeal?"
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2361.082,2373.827,"I think the difficulty is, are we looking at the hypothesis of what the Legislature could believe or are we looking at what the facts are?"
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.827,2385.619,"Well, the facts are... those aren't always... that depends on what a district judge finds, that here's a... you just can't go around and recognize facts, like... they don't grow on trees."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2401.629,2405.814,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice White, I believe I misunderstood your question."
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.984,2409.25,Yes.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2409.25,2413.889,"--held the other way, I think we could have met the clearly erroneous standard."
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.249,2416.481,You don't think the Court of Appeals--
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2416.481,2426.79,--think that there was sufficient evidence for the State to be able to sustain its case even under the right standard for appellate review.
1980.79-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.353,2428.461,"--Of course, it isn't ""clearly erroneous""."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2453.623,2462.993,I think perhaps it would be best to reach it this way.
1980.79-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.139,2532.278,But that's not the enactment of the statute.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2535.964,2538.212,--I believe in 1963.
1980.79-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.212,2540.556,So this is a 17-year-old statute.
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2541.852,2542.649,No.
1980.79-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.649,2545.195,When did it become unconstitutional?
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2545.195,2551.926,"I think it became... unconstitutional and I shouldn't so quickly say, no... sometime around 1963."
1980.79-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.926,2555.768,"When the neighboring states moved to 65 feet, that made the Iowa statute unconstitutional."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2555.768,2560.876,"I think when the neighboring states went to 65 feet, far more pertinently, when 65 feet became the national standard--"
1980.79-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.876,2563.516,"Well, whatever... Iowa had a constitutional duty to step into line."
1980.79-1320,1,31592,john_h_lederer,,2564.141,2565.967,--I think that's correct.
1980.79-1320,2,36699,mark_e_schantz,,3621.515,3624.044,Unless the Court has further questions.
1980.79-1320,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.044,3626.244,"Thank you, gentlemen."
