1984.83-2136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.237,"Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,34.237,38.808,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-2136,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.366,164.389,May I inquire about the consequences of a ruling adverse to your position?
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,191.958,196.693,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, from the point of view of the mentally ill that would be the principal consequence."
1984.83-2136,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.693,197.243,Yeah.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,204.283,206.283,I wouldn't call it inconvenience.
1984.83-2136,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.532,258.784,What do you know about the practical application of the Government's test?
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,269.791,277.731,"Well, we have the experience of the present case and the three companion cases that started out with them at the administrative level."
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.288,840.88,"Mr. Miller, do you think you should win the case if you can show that your reading is the better reading, or is the only reading that is possible?"
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,840.88,856.559,"Justice White, I'm familiar with the doctrine of deference, to which I think you're alluding, and I suppose if this were a 51-49 case we'd have some deference on the scales for the Government which would made our case more difficult."
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.54,887.011,"Well, apparently the Government has great difficulty concluding that it means what you say it does."
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,887.011,887.528,Yes.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.23,889.746,Yes.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,889.746,898.886,This Court has never taken the view that just because the Government takes one side of an issue that this is enough reason to--
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.886,905.306,Are you saying there is just no room in this language for the Government's construction?
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,905.306,919.415,"--I wouldn't say that, Mr. Justice, because as I said before, this statute is so complex and the language of it in many respects to obtuse that there's room for any kind of interpretation of it, depending on how you read it."
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.985,962.328,So you think the Court should just make its own independent... take its own independent look at the statute and figure out what it means without regard to what the agency says.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,962.328,968.232,I don't think the Court would ever construe the statute without regard to what the agency says.
1984.83-2136,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.115,969.898,"Well, you asked certainly--"
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,969.898,970.448,--lies in this--
1984.83-2136,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.448,971.267,--disregard it.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,971.267,974.469,--I'm asking you in the end not to accept it.
1984.83-2136,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1014.777,1015.61,"Well, when were--"
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1015.61,1018.496,--if inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the purpose.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.496,1021.181,--When were the intermediate care facilities covered?
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1021.181,1024.066,They were added to the statute in 1967.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.066,1024.735,'67.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1024.735,1026.202,But not the Medicaid provisions.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.87,1029.937,'71.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1029.937,1030.404,Yes.
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.517,1131.504,"Mr. Miller, may I just interrupt, because I think you'll be coming to this right now."
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1141.793,1142.41,--That's correct.
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.41,1147.614,And I guess they weren't covered by the '67 amendment or the '71 amendment.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1149.216,1163.706,"The '67 amendment provided that financial assistance could be provided to residents of intermediate care facilities, so that if a person qualified for financial aid under the elderly or disabled line program--"
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.706,1164.641,"That was the aged, blind and disabled, wasn't it?"
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1164.641,1165.058,--Yeah.
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.303,1188.857,But are you contending that the coverage here was created in 1971?
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1188.857,1190.543,"Yes, sir, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.528,1196.211,I understand.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1196.211,1197.297,--given to these people.
1984.83-2136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.297,1200.831,So the... you don't have to rely on the '72 amendment then.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1200.831,1201.364,No.
1984.83-2136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1204.283,1205.485,"Well, maybe I'm--"
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1205.485,1210.204,"There was a '72 amendment, but we're not relying upon it, and it's not pertinent here."
1984.83-2136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1395.109,1396.709,--I want to be sure about the page.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1397.944,1401.496,"--I think it's page 28 of the reply brief, yes."
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.042,1444.09,"Well, you have to... you certainly are making this argument, though, to say that this definition seems to foreclose or tends to foreclose defining this kind of facility that you represent as an IMD."
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1444.09,1445.19,That's correct.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.19,1457.997,"They say that... in effect they say that because this facility serves such a high percentage of mental patients, it is, in effect, an IMD."
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1457.997,1459.182,That's what the Government is saying.
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.182,1459.599,Yes.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1459.599,1462.317,All that this regulation does on the books today--
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.317,1465.003,But they certainly don't claim it's a psychiatric hospital.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1465.003,1469.471,"--They do not claim it's a psychiatric hospital, but they treat it like a psychiatric hospital for purposes of coverage."
1984.83-2136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.471,1473.273,Yes.
1984.83-2136,0,19505,charles_alvin_miller,,1473.273,1485.997,"The Government does rely also on the regulation that says a facility's... whether a facility is an IMD is to be determined by its ""overall character"", which are the words I put in quotes."
1984.83-2136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.722,1836.791,Ms. Oberly.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1836.791,1841.162,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.116,1896.08,"That's true, but I think it's of general interest to know whether the states can just scatter the mentally ill around in more facilities that presumably will have less specialized staff to take care of them, and if that satisfies the law in your view."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1896.08,1897.982,"--In theory, Your Honor, they could."
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.518,1955.768,Perhaps.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1955.768,1957.051,--at heart.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1957.051,1970.027,"Ms. Oberly, is it correct that the Government would be seeking to recoup vast sums of money from the states if your position is sustained here?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1970.027,1981.651,"As far as recoupment is concerned, all we know is the $18 million involved in the four consolidated cases, of which Connecticut's is one, which is a substantial amount of money."
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1982.135,1986.137,"Well, was the interpretation of Connecticut widespread among the states?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1986.137,1986.687,--Pardon?
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.687,1990.341,Was the interpretation placed on the statute--
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1990.341,1990.741,"Yes, yes."
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.741,1995.743,--by Connecticut the same interpretation most states placed on it?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1995.743,1998.211,Some states have no facilities like this.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2054.029,2063.719,"Has the Department, the Government, HHS, ever taken a different view of the proper meaning of the statute?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2063.719,2070.123,"No, Your Honor, we have not, and we disagree with Mr. Miller's characterization of our early regulations."
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.159,2185.348,Was the Government ever asked by states for an interpretation of this regulation?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2189.9,2193.604,I would suggest that the states should have sought advice.
1984.83-2136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.554,2432.544,But I take it you certainly concede that Middletown was not a mental hospital.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2432.544,2433.694,"It was not a mental hospital, but--"
1984.83-2136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.694,2435.127,It was an intermediate care facility.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2435.127,2435.746,--That's correct.
1984.83-2136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.746,2437.612,"But also an IMD, is that it?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2437.612,2438.448,That's correct.
1984.83-2136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.15,2442.683,Right.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2442.683,2444.602,But that's not the issue before the Court.
1984.83-2136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.795,2465.531,Is the name we give it or the function the controlling factor?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2465.531,2469.317,We think the labels are not material at all.
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.971,2505.756,"Would you clarify something for me I thought I understood, but I'm not sure I do."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2524.387,2528.106,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's why it's facilities."
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.477,2565.897,Does that suggest they are mutually exclusive categories then?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2568.416,2568.749,No.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2726.218,2737.759,"--Ms. Oberly, what year was it that the Department of Health and Human Services adopted its criteria, including the 50 percent figure?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2737.759,2741.411,"The 50 percent figure, which I stress again is not before the Court--"
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2741.411,2741.828,"Yes, I know."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2741.828,2743.429,"--and is not determinative, was first adopted--"
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2743.429,2745.029,I asked what year it was--
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2745.029,2761.491,"--It was first adopted I believe in either 1975 or 1976, again before Middletown Haven opened, as one of eight to ten criteria that HHS auditors should look at when they went to examine particular facilities."
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.491,2766.195,--May I ask again about the subparagraph 15 of the section we were talking about?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2780.453,2782.722,"If you assume the answer to the case in their favor, it makes sense."
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.722,2786.106,"--Well, then what I'm suggesting is one can read it either way."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2787.858,2794.012,But what I would like to point out is the anomalous results that flow from their reading that we don't think Congress could have intended.
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.349,2858.638,"I'm puzzled by the first example, because the end of the section... there's one definition of... I don't know what it is... intermediate care facility, the last part of it says,"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2865.992,2869.027,You can if you get separate certification for them.
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.027,2869.36,"Oh, I see."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2869.36,2874.079,But that doesn't mean you'll get Medicaid compensation for them if they're still in a mental hospital.
1984.83-2136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2883.268,2886.32,This is incredible.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,2886.32,2887.838,I hope it's not anything I said.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3005.563,3009.866,"On the practical level do you know how it works, Ms. Oberly?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3024.876,3027.578,My understanding is the certification comes from the state.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3030.53,3035.682,"They'd apply through the state who acts for the federal government, in other words, in making a certification?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3035.682,3037.301,--The state does the certifying.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3050.008,3055.179,"And, of course, no application is ever made to be certified as an IMD."
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3056.512,3057.014,That's correct.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3057.014,3063.768,"--would be determined by the federal government following an audit, presumably?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3063.768,3064.385,That's correct.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.83,3089.067,And the listed criteria are imposed flexibly by the federal government?
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3093.52,3095.989,No single criteria is determinative.
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3101.557,3114.034,So an ICF would certainly have no very comfortable basis for knowing whether a later audit would be--
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3114.034,3116.084,"That we would disagree with, Your Honor."
1984.83-2136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3141.534,3151.057,--Might there be other facilities around the country where it would be quite an uncertain question?
1984.83-2136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.057,3163.883,We will resume there at 1:00.
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3167.085,3169.787,Thank you.
1984.83-2136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.234,3359.558,"Do you suppose... I take it, then, you don't think there's room in this statute for the Department to take a different view, to take Connecticut's view?"
1984.83-2136,1,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,3359.558,3360.625,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1984.83-2136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.133,3555.1,"Thank you, counsel."
