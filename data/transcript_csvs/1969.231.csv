1969.231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.955,Mr. Waldman in 231 International Longshoremen against the Ariadne Shipping Co.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,15.96,19.724,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,60.884,74.32,Does that claim depend upon whether this record does or does not show the participation in Longshoremen work by American nationals not part of the ship's crew?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,74.32,77.016,"No, no."
1969.231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,137.044,147.612,"In other words, foreign-flag ship can't bring its own longshoremen as part of the ship's company and escape the reach of the board?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,147.612,148.436,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.557,221.766,"There maybe one remaining issue may their not which you assume to be resolved and assume to be a fact, and that is that longshoremen's work is involved here."
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,233.582,233.674,Well --
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.674,242.531,"May there not be an issue as to whether or not that is traditionally work of the crew, the purser staff and so on of ship or whether it is necessarily longshoreman's --"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,242.531,249.467,"Well, Your Honor again, I have got to distinguish between what the record shows and what they contend."
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.42,360.383,And you say line handling?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,362.104,363.854,"Yes sir, yes."
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.854,369.084,"Well, I just couldn't physically be -- have been done by members of the crew because they couldn't get back aboard?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,369.084,384.38,"Certainly as a ship is coming in unless they are going to jump ashore before the lines are cast ashore that has to be shore-based employees working is, and what's performed here and was I think here, this is where factually their wrong."
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.676,450.51,"Well, a mere claim however doesn't take jurisdiction away from the Courts, does it?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,463.448,464.018,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.018,466.839,And I think so far as the other crew of the ships.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,466.839,466.987,That's correct.
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.987,478.465,And the mere claim that they are doing some sort of work that somewhere in the United States is done by somebody else except for the cruise ships doesn't take all jurisdiction away from the Courts I should say.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,478.465,482.811,"Well, of course, then you get to the question of who decides it if the claim is well found."
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,534.684,535.406,There was no such thing.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,535.406,545.523,That's right Your Honor and I don't think the question has reached the Court but the answer is how I would say it would be determined which I emphasize is not presented in this case.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.523,549.564,What do you claim that the crew is doing longshoremen's work or that --
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,549.564,550.317,No.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.317,552.365,-- some independent shore based crew?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,552.365,554.79,Both.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.833,608.657,Do you claim that even if it was the ship based crew that was doing this work that there is preemption?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,608.657,609.964,"Yes Your Honor, we do."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.767,612.025,The side of Incres in those cases?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,612.025,613.729,Yes Your Honor.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.398,615.46,And how about the third point?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,615.46,624.83,"The third point he said was, he was asked who is doing this now and he said partly the crew and partly American residents hired locally and specially for the occasion."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.4,810.519,Say do you -- do you challenge the injunction in its entirety?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,810.519,811.712,No Your Honor.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.891,853.854,What paragraph of the injunction that are considered to be valid?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,853.854,854.918,One and two.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.918,856.926,"One and two, and you challenge both three and four?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,856.926,872.435,"Well, four as I read under some ambiguity, as I read the opinion of the District Court of Appeals, I think the District Court of Appeals intended to annul paragraph four in it's entirety, although that's not entirely clear."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.053,879.769,What if paragraph four was not annulled?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,879.769,883.813,"A fortiori, we would challenge that, that's even broader than paragraph three."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.97,1025.387,Let me get it straight you -- I thought you said a moment ago that this picketing was as far as this record shows on the evidence was directed in both the ship's crew --
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1025.387,1025.832,That's correct.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.832,1028.145,-- and third party longshoremen work?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1028.145,1028.816,Correct.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.816,1029.488,Both.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1029.488,1030.29,Your Honor --
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.29,1036.523,"Well then, you don't agree Mr. Waldman or maybe I misread this footnote six in the Government's brief."
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1037.232,1037.42,Insofar --
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.42,1045.862,"Says here, “American longshoremen will locally hire to do the longshore work and the union was seeking to carry its dispute to them.”"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1045.862,1048.502,"Well, that is correct partially."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.439,1067.162,"But we already answered this Mr. Waldman, but let me ask it again?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1067.162,1067.808,Yes sir.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.808,1071.997,Even if the ship's crew were the only ones doing this longshore work --
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1071.997,1072.583,Correct.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.583,1073.798,It'd still be here with us?
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1073.798,1074.413,Absolutely.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.413,1074.686,All right.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1074.686,1075.149,Absolutely.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.149,1083.752,"Let's assume you're wrong on that, that and it was only the ship's crew, there is no preemption on your inquest in those cases."
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1092.878,1111.234,Then it should go to the National Labor Relations Board to determine how the combined set of facts and the considerations that apply to the combined set of facts yield a result consonant with the terms of the act and this Court's decisions beginning --
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.234,1129.72,"Well Mr. Waldman for that extent, then do you-- you do agree with this sentence in Footnote 6 to the Government's brief, were there any risk of improperly involving the ship's crew that could be accommodated in the first instance by the board in any proceedings before it?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1129.72,1138.141,Mr. Justice White has in his question assumed I was wrong on my primary legal thesis.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.141,1140.005,"I am too, but I am dismissed here --"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1140.005,1141.01,Yes.
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.081,1148.204,With that assumption but a mixed mixture of it.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1148.204,1150.972,"With that assumption, I agree with Footnote 6."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.972,1151.541,I see.
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1151.541,1162.211,"Without that assumption and on my argument as it is, I disagree with Footnote 6 of the board's brief."
1969.231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.298,1408.569,"It sounds like the factual matters aren't very well taken care off, but we have to disagree with you on what the results should be if with respect to a ship's crew doing longshoremen's work, wouldn't there have to be some clarification in the facts?"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1408.569,1423.508,I would think Your Honors that they should still be reversal on the ground that this records shows without contradiction that this work was being performed at least impart by American residents hired locally.
1969.231,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.803,1473.417,"The only problem that the Government's brief and in it stating the facts as it does in Footnote 6 is that it was filed many days before the respondent's brief and the Government wasn't aware of the claims, at least that the respondent was going to make in it's brief about that or --"
1969.231,0,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,1473.417,1477.765,"That's correct, that's correct Your Honor."
1969.231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.791,1687.014,"Very well Mr. Waldman, thank you."
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1690.141,1692.944,Thank you.
1969.231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1719.619,1720.929,Where are the facts in the records?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1720.929,1724.694,"All right, well that's what I want to point out Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.277,1745.201,"Of course, where confined to the facts of record and what we --"
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1745.201,1745.35,"All right, let me start with --"
1969.231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1745.35,1748.125,made traditionally know which isn't very much in this case.
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1748.125,1751.228,"All right, let me start with Tim Kaine's deposition."
1969.231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.307,1777.519,"Now where -- excuse me counselor, are you in the appendix on page 53?"
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1777.519,1778.113,"No, no."
1969.231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.852,1785.629,Where is it?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1785.629,1787.518,"Inadvertently, I can't understand this."
1969.231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.753,1810.686,It's not a printed record is it?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1810.686,1811.831,I beg your pardon.
1969.231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.152,1816.899,But not in the appendix?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1816.899,1817.565,It's not in the appendix --
1969.231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.565,1818.036,Pardon me --
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1818.036,1825.221,"-- and I didn't realize that before -- until I got before you all today that that somehow was omitted, it must have just have been an error in my part because I didn't put together the appendix."
1969.231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.221,1829.656,"Well, it's up to the parties to get to the end of the appendix what they want to bring to the attention to the Court --"
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1829.656,1835.913,"That's right Your Honor but I understand Mr. Justice Stewart, according to the rules that it is still before the Court, even if not including appendix."
1969.231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.99,1838.937,"Now, if you also relied with the Court but it does."
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1853.191,1863.217,"Well respectfully Your Honor, I check that rule because I saw that this wasn't here in the Rule 17 on page 15 of the Supreme Court rules and it says that everything in the record is before this Court."
1969.231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.313,1881.171,"Well, in doing so, you may represent properly only matters which are in the record itself?"
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1881.171,1892.609,"Surely Your Honor, and that is why I put the record at pages 53 and 54 which at pages 28 and 29 of the original transcript which I have and be reading from and unfortunately, I have not done it."
1969.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1892.609,1894.172,When is that before it?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1894.172,1898.953,"Yes, it is Your Honor because it is in the record of this case."
1969.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1898.953,1900.963,It's in the record on this case.
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1900.963,1901.711,Yes Your Honor.
1969.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1901.711,1905.12,And that record is on file but is not printed?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1905.12,1908.079,That part unfortunately was not printed with the appendix.
1969.231,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1954.11,1957.065,And what about this loading of stores?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1957.065,1958.359,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1969.231,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.359,1968.696,"The loading of stores, food, alcoholic beverages, all type of food beverages supplies of all nature, this is your idea?"
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1968.696,1969.937,Yes sir.
1969.231,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.937,1971.262,Of page 53?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1971.262,1972.512,Right.
1969.231,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.512,1973.291,Was that true?
1969.231,1,39822,richard_m_leslie,,1973.291,1973.844,That's true.
1969.231,2,42291,seymour_m_waldman,,3523.347,3526.946,I can't do too much in a minute but may I just make these brief points.
1969.231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.707,3597.739,Thank you Mr. Waldman.
