1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 88-493, the University of Pennsylvania v. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,10.556,13.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,71.429,75.381,xxx peer review materials are--
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,75.381,76.214,Yes.
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.327,123.029,--Conceded the University's right to determine who may teach.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,125.514,136.705,"--Well, its interest in deciding who may teach, which we contend... well, and really the government concedes, that it is First Amendment based."
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.705,151.981,"--Well, Mr. Lee, that certainly is a weak sort of a First Amendment interest and wouldn't the same interest extend to employees of a newspaper or a public advocacy organization or to a wide range of employees?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,157.702,162.254,"Well, at least... for what, now?"
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.943,182.732,"Well, but that's really language from our cases where you're talking about a state university, where you're talking about the state infringing it."
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.732,194.106,There is really no holding of this Court that says that professors are any freer from state infringement than any other type of people who might have freedom of speech infringed.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,194.106,199.343,"I think that's probably right, Mr. Chief Justice, that in... well Keyishian might be a holding."
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.981,261.798,"Well, if they're relevant?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,261.798,263.665,Excuse me?
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.665,265.181,A showing of relevance.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,265.181,265.431,Yes.
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.431,266.131,And need.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,266.131,273.021,"And it should be noted, Justice O'Connor, that there is no dispute that these issues... that these matters are relevant."
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.004,303.556,What is this serious constitutional question?
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,303.556,305.989,"--It is this, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.414,370.914,But of course--
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.914,371.7,--But what--
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.7,372.216,--Excuse me.
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.866,374.15,"Go ahead, Chief Justice."
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.15,382.906,"Well, what case is... is the best from this Court supporting a proposition that universities have a First Amendment right to determine who should teach?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,382.906,384.239,Four cases.
1989.88-493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.239,385.858,"Well, what's the best one?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,386.858,397.916,The best one I would say is probably Keyishian because it's a holding.
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.814,422.247,Excuse me.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,437.423,439.089,--Excuse me?
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.089,442.391,"I mean, I guess somebody has a right to say who may teach, but does it have to be the faculty?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,442.858,454.516,It... it would be those who are responsible for determining the academic affairs of the university.
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.516,455.385,--So it could be the Senate?
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,456.751,457.584,The faculty senate?
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.584,458.334,--No.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,459.669,461.121,The state Senate?
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.121,461.621,Right.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,461.621,465.739,"That would be a harder case, but, yes, in that instance it... it--"
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.739,467.173,I suppose you could have the governor decide.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,467.173,469.875,--It would be a harder case.
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.875,470.893,Why?
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,470.893,471.643,It would be a harder case.
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.643,471.959,That's my problem.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,472.643,473.243,Well--
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.243,481.33,"I mean, what is the principle that... that members of a faculty have a constitutional right to... to... well, replicate themselves--"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,481.33,481.697,--In the event--
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.697,482.932,--like amoeba or what?
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,484.449,503.095,"--In the event that you had those kinds of determinations that are central to the operation of the academic mission of the university being operated, as it never has, by someone in government, then it is that entity that would enjoy the First Amendment freedom, yes."
1989.88-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.095,505.964,So the government has a First Amendment right.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,508.347,515.653,"It is... well, what you're posing for me, of course, is a hypothetical that so far as I know exists in no place."
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.094,604.709,"Well, Mr. Lee, the... the interest on the other side in this case of a... a faculty member to be considered for tenure without the impermissible consideration of race or gender seems to be a much more direct constitutional right that we're talking about."
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,608.578,609.828,We fully concede--
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.828,618.284,And certainly these... these evaluations on which the tenure decision is based are of critical importance.
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.284,626.223,I can't imagine anything that would be more relevant than an examination of those tenure evaluation letters.
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,626.223,634.979,--There is no question that the right to be free from discrimination is very important.
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.694,664.498,"Well, didn't Congress do that when it enacted Title VII?"
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,664.498,665.565,No.
1989.88-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,703.973,711.293,"Well, Mr. Lee, despite your welcome assurances that this is a narrow issue, I just can't see it that way."
1989.88-493,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,745.28,770.414,"Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware of any practice in any other context, employment context, that is analogous to the one that has developed with respect to the exercise of the determination of who may teach."
1989.88-493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,801.984,804.986,"Well, what we get are all letters saying they're wonderful."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1680.15,1684.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1722.394,1724.796,"You might even say that about the exclusionary rule, can't you?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1724.796,1736.754,"--It could indeed, and this Court has recognized any number of exceptions to that rule by virtue of the concerns about impediments to the ascertainment of truth."
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.46,1858.279,Which colleges are those?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1860.362,1886.179,"--They are not identified in our brief, but they run a fairly substantial gamut, as we describe at pages 31 and 32, approximately 20 percent of the surveyed colleges, approximately 100 colleges and universities responded to the survey do provide information either with respect to inside peer reviewers or outside peer reviewers."
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.298,1889.215,Just give me a few of the best known.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1891.0,1895.119,--I am unable to give you specific names and verses.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.51,1908.629,--You hope.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1910.579,1914.199,I hope you will be convinced that my confidence is well-founded.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.199,1921.019,"You say they furnish information, but do they furnish the materials?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1921.019,1924.071,"A substantial percentage, not the majority--"
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.071,1925.471,"I know, but--"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1925.471,1926.456,--A substantial percentage--
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.456,1927.223,--let's just take any--
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1927.223,1928.456,--furnish the materials--
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.456,1930.842,--Actually furnish the written materials--
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1930.842,1931.442,--That is correct.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.442,1935.377,"--they just don't summarize it or just say, now here was really the reason?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1938.346,1940.781,They disclose everything.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.781,1942.114,Okay.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1942.114,1943.583,They disclose everything.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.583,1945.516,Then you're really giving up something.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1964.229,1968.181,I don't think there's any question that confidentiality is of value.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.346,2046.012,Did you mention before or--
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2046.012,2048.714,I think I was deflected.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.547,2050.014,--Yes.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2050.014,2076.864,"The proposed qualified privilege that we have heard here, or the balancing test... we've been told that they will be happy with either... will, I think in all likelihood from what we have heard this morning, produce evermore of the wasteful unproductive preliminary kinds of litigation that besets an already overcrowded federal system."
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.259,2156.215,"Could I ask, why do they need the names of the people who have furnished these opinions?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2156.215,2160.852,They need the names... pardon me.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.961,2176.844,xxx address that?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2176.844,2179.496,--I'm happy to address it in response to the question.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.496,2181.098,"No, but are you addressing it in your argument?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2185.884,2189.419,Our argument is indeed that we need unencumbered access to it.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.419,2190.352,Including names?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2190.352,2191.569,Including names.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.45,2227.794,"General Starr, many years ago... and we've held it for many years... that there are no limitations on government investigatory requests except that they have to be relevant to the... to a subject."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2241.368,2242.554,"Oh, I think--"
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.554,2249.458,"--the way some other... I mean, even if it is marginally relevant, why can't it be arbitrary or capricious and therefore be--"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2249.458,2249.791,"--Oh, I think it could."
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.791,2250.774,--subject to review under the APA?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2250.774,2251.741,I think it could.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.193,2285.212,"Well, but arbitrary and capricious means more than just improper motive."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2300.655,2304.09,"Well, but that is not so at all, with all due respect."
1989.88-493,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.812,2378.472,"Well, Mr. Starr... General Starr, it seems to me that the Third Circuit certainly thought at least that furnishing the names might not be as relevant and not as necessary and that that could be redacted."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2390.28,2402.539,"--We have not cross-petitioned with respect to the Third Circuit's determination, not that there should be redaction but that redaction is open for litigation at the district court."
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.636,2442.413,"Well, is the government retreating at all from the rule of Oklahoma Press against Walling, which certainly doesn't talk about any sort of arbitrary and capricious review for subpoenas but speaks in terms of if it's reasonably thought to be relevant, that's the end of it?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2442.413,2444.013,I am not retreating at all.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.981,2470.914,An impermissible purpose?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2473.849,2474.333,--No.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.326,2490.827,I think you've changed your answer to me then.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2501.702,2503.635,--I'm not sure that the issue--
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.635,2505.904,"Well, that standard goes well beyond bad, bad motive."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2505.904,2507.772,--I haven't taken this through an APA analysis.
1989.88-493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.74,2593.458,"General Starr, that provision you read, really that doesn't say anything except you've got to try and get it informally."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2598.362,2600.379,--That is a restraint.
1989.88-493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.824,2635.519,"No, but you're basing... as I understand you, what you're saying is if you go about in an orderly and polite way requesting peer review reports and they keep saying, we're not going to give them to you, and you keep saying we need them in order to make a full investigation, you're going to issue the subpoena and you have an unencumbered right to have the subpoena complied with."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2635.519,2635.769,--Absolutely.
1989.88-493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.385,2641.939,You don't have to prove that you tried with other relevant information to prove the charge.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2641.939,2642.189,--That's quite right.
1989.88-493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.435,2678.378,"But it seems to me not an unreasonable construction of the problem to say that the information that's most relevant in a case like this is the confidential information upon which the decision was made, so you're almost always going to want it and ask for it."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2683.08,2685.513,I agree that it's normal enforcement practice.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.199,2721.888,You aren't really suggesting that it's necessary for the Commission to cross some threshold--
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2721.888,2723.305,Not at all.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.305,2724.238,--other than relevance?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2724.238,2725.157,That is correct.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.109,2731.811,"Now, you don't want us to say as long as--"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2745.035,2745.951,--Indeed not.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.506,2816.964,"General Starr, can I talk about the slippery slope argument that the... that the government makes that if you do it for academics, you've got to do it for everybody, there's really no basis for drawing the line here."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2854.022,2856.808,I certainly can't think of an exact parallel.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.564,2957.989,"I suppose that if... that if the Commission just dropped this case and issued a right to sue letter and there was a suit that if this privilege is available, discovery... she could not discover these materials."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2957.989,2958.856,That's quite right.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.026,2991.644,On what basis did the court of appeals remand on the redaction issue?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2998.715,3004.619,It was broadly stated confidentiality concerns that there might not in fact be a need for this.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.969,3006.185,--It was sort of an evidentiary thing?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3006.185,3013.558,--Certainly leaving it opened for evidence to be adduced as to whether in fact the Commission needed this information.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.681,3113.304,"Well, in a non-Title VII case the professor is denied tenure and he sues and claims that he's been denied tenure because his membership in some party."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3123.779,3132.635,"It certainly could, depending on the grounds of the university's decision and on what the charge of... what the allegation is."
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.718,3134.118,"Well, he claims he--"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3134.118,3135.92,--on the nature of a First Amendment violation.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.92,3139.789,--He claims he's been denied tenure because of his membership in some party.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3139.789,3140.822,That's right.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.024,3145.126,If it's a public university.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3145.126,3146.843,--At a public... precisely.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.805,3196.923,"The inquiry is, but not the... not the collection of information to pursue the inquiry."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3225.942,3230.346,A case can be washed out by the Commission at any point.
1989.88-493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3279.077,3291.652,"But, Counsel, some... some plaintiffs do... there have been any number of suits in the district courts where teachers who are denied tenure or appointment do follow a scorched-earth policy."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3294.77,3297.538,--It certainly would cover that.
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.004,3333.247,"If you win this case, I would think the... wouldn't you think that the plaintiff... this scorched-earth plaintiff would be able to discover the peer review materials?"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3333.247,3347.555,"Once the private plaintiff, Justice White, is proceeding under the federal rules, then there is an enormous amount of latitude that is given to federal district judges in governing the conduct of the litigation, just--"
1989.88-493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.555,3347.771,I know.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3355.076,3358.212,--I don't think the Court should address that issue here.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3358.212,3363.099,But the only argument you have in the district court is that it's burdensome and most district judges reject that.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3364.649,3387.548,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, with all respect, this Court has said time and again, including a very instructive opinion by Justice Powell in Branzburg against Hays, noting that district courts do not have to blind themselves to the sensitivity, the potential sensitivity of litigation, and can govern the litigation appropriately."
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.714,3391.0,"Well, Justice Powell's opinion was a one-person opinion in Branzburg."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3391.0,3391.416,--Quite right.
1989.88-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3393.932,3394.868,"General Starr,--"
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3394.868,3396.168,[Laughter]
1989.88-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3396.168,3405.724,"--some reference is made, though, to the University of Pennsylvania being a public institution."
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3411.96,3412.194,Quite right.
1989.88-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3413.827,3414.662,It's a private institution in that respect?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3414.662,3416.746,It's a very distinguished private institution.
1989.88-493,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.746,3418.798,As distinguished from Penn State?
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3418.798,3419.481,Quite right.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3419.481,3422.083,The distinguished public--
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3423.018,3427.637,I... readily I accept.
1989.88-493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.637,3429.506,Which is a distinguished public institution.
1989.88-493,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3429.506,3440.361,The final thing that I want to leave with the Court is that the extent of this intrusion is narrow.
1989.88-493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.765,3445.531,"Thank you, General Starr."
1989.88-493,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3447.467,3451.519,It is now very apparent just how narrow this case is.
1989.88-493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3539.876,3540.976,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
