1984.83-997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,We will hear arguments next in Trans World Airlines against Thurston.
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,57.687,78.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this Court granted certiorari to the second circuit to consider three issues under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act: one, a standard of liability under the ADEA; two, a standard for wilfullness under the ADEA; and three, whether a union can be monetarily liable under the ADEA."
1984.83-997,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,218.674,221.226,"Of course, that is some discrimination, isn't it?"
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,221.226,224.495,"Well, we submit it is not based on age."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.108,488.316,"I suppose if the basis for the ruling was you were discriminating, I suppose you could have eliminated the discrimination the other way by just not allowing any automatic transfers."
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,488.316,499.271,"Well, our contract allowed downbidding, and prior to age 60, historically the contract did allow downbidding, so we felt--"
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.271,499.79,Automatic?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,499.79,500.823,"--No, not automatic."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.823,501.873,"Well, automatic--"
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,501.873,506.711,"For those few specific situations, but the normal bidding procedure--"
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.711,508.729,"--Well, you have some automatic downbidding."
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,508.729,509.329,--That's right.
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.329,511.515,Was that required by the contract?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,511.515,513.598,"Yes, that was provided in the contract."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.598,515.983,I suppose you could have negotiated yourself out of that.
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,523.489,546.836,"Arguably not, but those provisions have been in the contract a long time, and we certainly would have been faced with a claim by the plaintiffs if we did eliminate those types of automatic downbidding that that was an effort at age discrimination because we were eliminating the bases for their claims, and that that would be further evidence of age discrimination."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.836,557.81,What is your legal position under the contract if you have to give automatic downbidding to pilots becoming 60?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,558.327,563.131,We say that that is not... that there is no provision in the contract that requires that on the basis--
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.131,564.816,--Or forbids it?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,564.816,566.1,"--Well, when they get--"
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.1,567.483,Would you have to... is it--
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,567.483,570.803,"--When they reach age 60, they are not in a position that they can perform as captains."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.803,571.669,--I understand.
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,571.669,581.925,The contract says that a captain... defines a contract... defines a captain in Section 33(b) as someone who is a pilot in command.
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.277,584.511,He is no longer anything.
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,584.511,586.496,--he is not a pilot in command.
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.369,599.821,What if a month before he got to be 60 you let him downbid?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,599.821,602.106,"We did, and that is how we got 60."
1984.83-997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.929,609.479,As flight engineers.
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,609.479,618.117,Who bid down in the normal bidding procedures that were in the contract before the law was amended in 1978 and have continued to serve.
1984.83-997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.49,634.06,May I think this through out loud with you for just a second?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,646.152,650.421,The class that is involved here insofar as who is aggrieved are--
1984.83-997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.421,653.89,"No, well, those aggrieved are a subclass of the class I have described."
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,653.89,656.575,"--That is right, but if at age 59 and a half--"
1984.83-997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.575,668.8,"I know, but is it correct, and I am not sure this answers it, is it correct that everybody in the class except those who reach the age of 60 have a contractual right to downbid as I described the class?"
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,668.8,680.691,"--Everybody prior to age 60 have a right, and if there is a vacancy, the company... and they have the requisite seniority, the company awards them that right, but when they hit age 60, the age 60 rule comes... applies to them."
1984.83-997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.112,688.245,But is there anything that--
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,688.245,690.981,The contract specifically says they have to be pilots in command.
1984.83-997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.981,696.884,--Is there anything other than the fact that they are 60 years of age that disqualifies them from the downbidding right?
1984.83-997,0,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,696.884,709.108,"No, it is the age 60, a rule imposed by the government, and now the government is saying, we must make... they are telling us what we must do with them, despite the fact that they were the ones who imposed the government regulation upon us in the first place."
1984.83-997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,713.262,733.325,Mr. Abram?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,733.325,749.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the argument addressed by TWA revolves around Section 4(a) of the Age Discrimination Act, and argues that there is no substantive violation of that Act."
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.272,938.756,"I take it you would be urging the same position if in express language the contract said that pilots who become disqualified by reasons of health or some other reasons from remaining as a captain may downbid, but pilots who become disqualified by reason of age may not."
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,938.756,941.391,"Your Honor, that is precisely 4(f)--"
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.391,943.491,"If that... if in so many words, you would still take the same position?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,943.491,947.379,--4(f)(1) addresses precisely that type of possibility.
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.195,951.997,Even though it is another brand of age discrimination?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,951.997,960.187,"--If there were age discrimination, it would be covered by 4(a); 4(f)(1) then steps into place as a defense to that age discrimination."
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.477,973.696,"Well, I know, but there are two different kinds of age discrimination."
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,973.696,975.312,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.312,978.898,Aren't we talking about two different kinds of age discrimination?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,993.824,997.295,That is precisely what... is argued.
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.295,1004.382,But then they say also by reason of your age we won't give you the same privileges as other pilots who become disqualified.
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1004.382,1018.458,"Well, they say that by reason of the age 60 rule, the BFOQ rule which the FAA has imposed, we will mandatorily retire you rather than then permit you to exercise your--"
1984.83-997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.458,1020.075,And the reason we are doing it is because of your age.
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1020.075,1043.257,"--Well, the reason for that decision is one in this instance which has to be addressed, I think, to the employer, but the question that the association, the Airline Pilots Association addresses is that that decision, whatever the reason, and even if it is because of age, Your Honor, is protected by 4(f)(1), under the plain meaning of the statute and as buttressed by the legislative history."
1984.83-997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.048,1225.592,"You say then that if a practice is justified under 4(f)(1), the fact that the employer may treat employees of a lesser age more leniently does not make the practice that is justified under 4(f)(1) a discrimination because of age?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1225.592,1232.263,I analyze it in terms of a defense to what would otherwise be considered age discrimination.
1984.83-997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.677,1258.247,Because you would be treating people who attained age 60 differently than people who attained age 45 in a comparable situation?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1258.247,1265.401,"Well, that depends, Your Honor, on whether it is comparable, and the Second Circuit split two to one on whether there were apples and oranges here, and--"
1984.83-997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.401,1268.788,"But don't you say, even if it is comparable, you are protected by 4(f)(1)?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1268.788,1269.555,--That's correct.
1984.83-997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1270.571,1278.177,"Congress could not pass a law and say that all pilots at age 60 shall be put out to pasture, could they?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1278.177,1291.469,"I think Congress, pursuant to its authority to regulate commerce, could do so, just as it has delegated that authority to the Federal Aviation Administration, to say that if the FAA chose--"
1984.83-997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.469,1296.206,I didn't understand FAA said you will quit.
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1298.64,1300.174,"--That's correct, and the--"
1984.83-997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1300.174,1303.026,"Well, could the FAA have said you can't work?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1303.026,1308.263,"--The FAA could have said you can't be a flight engineer, and they have not at this point said so, but they could have."
1984.83-997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.263,1310.465,Could they say you can't work any place?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1310.465,1315.084,"I would think, Your Honor, that that would be unconstitutional under other provisions."
1984.83-997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.084,1316.786,Isn't that what has happened here?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1316.786,1317.586,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1463.865,1469.167,"May I ask, below the union prevailed on this question, didn't it?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1469.167,1470.936,--The union prevailed on this question below.
1984.83-997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1470.936,1477.273,"And neither EEOC nor... sought review of that, did they?"
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1477.273,1484.279,"They not only didn't seek review of it, Your Honor, they opposed review of it explicitly, and said that they would intend to collect on a joint and several liability."
1984.83-997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1484.279,1487.564,Are you going to argue that we ought not hear TWA on this question?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1488.898,1493.402,TWA raised their right to shift damages.
1984.83-997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1501.272,1503.507,They can't have contribution under Northwest Airlines--
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1503.507,1504.307,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1505.875,1507.811,--Are you arguing that we ought or ought not here?
1984.83-997,1,35380,michael_e_abram,,1507.811,1531.427,"I am arguing, Your Honor, that the Court ought not to hear it, but that if it does hear TWA's claim, it should be rejected under Northwest v. TWU because it is a claim for contribution, and I can perceive no distinction between this statutory scheme in that sense and, of course, Title 7 and the Equal Pay Act, which was part of the FLSA that was dealt with in the TWU case."
1984.83-997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.904,1628.221,Mr. Wallace.
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1628.221,1640.898,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three separate categories of issues to be determined in this case."
1984.83-997,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.193,1863.393,"Are those really comparable situations when you are talking about a pilot who is 35 or 40 years old, runs into a completely unanticipated medical difficulty, and on the other hand, it seems to me in the case of a pilot who is approaching age 60, that is not a sudden thing at all."
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1866.911,1874.05,And it was anticipated by making a request for a transfer prior to reaching age 60.
1984.83-997,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.658,1911.873,"Well, Mr. Wallace, what about the effect of Section 4(f)(1), which appears expressly to permit an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited by the Age Discrimination and Employment Act for a person who is retired pursuant to a BFOQ?"
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1911.873,1923.764,"Yes, that is the argument made with respect to a reading of that phrase at the beginning of that section."
1984.83-997,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.764,1930.937,"Well, doesn't the literal language certainly make it look like that argument has to be dealt with?"
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1930.937,1935.572,"Well, we attempted to deal with it, and let me deal with it now, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-997,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.318,1969.245,"Doesn't the legislative history indicate that if there is a BFOQ, the employer was not intended to have to find some other job for the mandatorily retired employee?"
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1969.245,1978.768,"And we agree with that, that there is no necessity to make special arrangements for a mandatorily retired employee."
1984.83-997,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.437,2047.745,"Well, if the EEOC position were to prevail, wouldn't it have the effect in general of discouraging employers from offering any benefits to anybody?"
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2062.255,2065.826,"--I don't know the answer to that question, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-997,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.925,2277.995,Do we have a statutory provision equivalent exactly to 4(f)(1)?
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2277.995,2285.951,"--That was not present, but I think the hypothetical that I just discussed really answers it."
1984.83-997,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.285,2328.878,"Mr. Wallace, isn't the difference is that in your hypothetical, at the time the two people apply, neither of them is a member of the BFOQ, whereas in the case before us, at the time the application to downgrade is made, the person who applies is then the member of a BFOQ?"
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2335.032,2336.634,One of the two applicants--
1984.83-997,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.634,2338.784,You hypothesize away the statutory provision.
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2338.784,2345.573,--One of the two applicants had been subject to the BFOQ for the captain job.
1984.83-997,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.401,2375.009,"It seems to me your stronger argument is not that the hypothetical is the same, but rather, that the BFOQ is made for the purpose of determining eligibility to fly airplanes, not to be flight engineers."
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2375.009,2376.775,--I agree with that completely.
1984.83-997,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.775,2381.746,"I don't know whether the language will accommodate that, but that is... if there is merit in your position, it seems to me that is the argument."
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2381.746,2401.159,"Well, the language is, like so many other things in this statute, as the Court recognized in Lorillard against Pons, the statute was a hybrid of approaches, and they spliced together approaches from various statutes, and the BFOQ approach was taken from Title 7."
1984.83-997,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.786,2657.792,"Of course, those examples are always the kind that proponents of the bill give, but then Congress enacts a general provision, and it covers a lot more people than just the examples."
1984.83-997,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2657.792,2678.891,"--That's right, but my point is that this Court's interpretation of the statutory terms are going to cover a lot more people than just the plaintiffs in this case, and that it is important to keep in mind the examples that were foremost in the Congressional mind in enacting these provisions."
1984.83-997,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.406,2807.606,"Thank you, counsel."
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2810.125,2818.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is not a case about what type of accommodation should be given to workers of any age."
1984.83-997,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.645,2997.366,But isn't that subject to the grievance procedure?
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2997.366,2998.166,It is--
1984.83-997,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2998.166,2999.416,"Yes, it is."
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2999.416,3006.655,"--Yes, it is subject to the grievance procedure, Your Honor, but we are talking about whether bidding is the appropriate universe here."
1984.83-997,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3103.266,3106.587,Just what difference would that make in the whole--
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3106.587,3122.513,"Because when Captain Thurston asked to transfer to flight engineer, the response he got from the company was not that he didn't have a bid on file, but that he was about to reach the mandatory retirement age that had been agreed to by the union and the company."
1984.83-997,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.12,3299.69,"--Could I ask you, what about the Willfulness issue?"
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3301.34,3303.475,Our position is the same as the EEOC.
1984.83-997,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.165,3314.95,"That issue is here, isn't it?"
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3314.95,3320.954,"--That issue definitely is here, and I might add, Your Honor, that we supported TWA--"
1984.83-997,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.954,3324.056,I guess we wouldn't need to decide it if we decided there was no liability.
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3324.056,3324.623,--That's right.
1984.83-997,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.441,3327.808,Right.
1984.83-997,3,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3327.808,3338.399,"--in our opposition to the petition for certiorari, so we believe the case is indistinguishable from the Perini, North River Parks Associates case which EEOC has cited in its reply brief."
1984.83-997,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3339.699,3341.017,Do you have anything further?
1984.83-997,4,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,3341.017,3341.367,Yes.
1984.83-997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3342.167,3345.836,You have four minutes remaining.
1984.83-997,4,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,3345.836,3362.698,"If I may just briefly address the willfulness question, the statute in Section 7(b) says the liquidated damages or double damages should only be provided, only... that's the word in the statute... only provided in the case of a willful violation."
1984.83-997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.059,3586.094,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Oechler."
1984.83-997,4,27768,henry_j_oechler_jr,,3586.094,3586.51,"--Oh, thank you."
1984.83-997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3589.062,3590.412,"Thank you, gentlemen."
