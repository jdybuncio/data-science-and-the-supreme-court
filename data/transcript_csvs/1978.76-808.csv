1978.76-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.018,The case is submitted.
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,74.508,77.211,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.76-808,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,202.286,211.508,Do the -- does the state concede that these people except for alienage are further qualified?
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,211.508,226.176,"Yes, Your Honor with the caveat in the record which I should perhaps call to your attention and that is, in addition to the appropriate citizenship requirements, there are other grounds for obtaining provisional as distinguished from permanent certificates."
1978.76-808,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,258.603,268.886,"One other question and I'll let you go.In the appendix on page 25, is the statement under Rule 9 (g)."
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,268.886,269.235,That is correct.
1978.76-808,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.235,274.475,Do the appellants accept that as true and correct?
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,274.475,275.78,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.564,384.372,They are authorized to serve on the school boards at higher teaching?
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,384.372,385.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,469.866,470.642,Another question.
1978.76-808,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,475.114,477.837,"No, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1160.721,1164.392,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1230.776,1244.91,"Well isn't there a difference, we do not permit, the Constitution does not permit teaching religious subjects in the public schools but it fully protects the right to teach religious subjects in private school?"
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1244.91,1245.437,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1245.974,1250.034,It seems to me it somewhat dissolves the point your making.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1250.034,1252.258,"Well, I think not Your Honor for the following reason."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1292.266,1295.508,Parents have a choice about sending their children.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1302.652,1314.186,"Well, that's entirely correct Your Honor, but it is also true in New York that parents have no choice at the present time whether their private school students are taught the principles of democracy or not."
1978.76-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1332.09,1340.354,But isn't it possible that New York may have felt it was confirmed with conflicting claims with respect to private schools.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1356.664,1368.289,"Again, Your Honor, we're not saying in this case that New York is required by the Constitution to have exactly identical requirements for public school and private school teachers."
1978.76-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.687,1419.37,"Well, the point I was trying to make to you in my question was that New York could with equal constitutional validity decide to stop short with private schools of its going as far as there were public schools in saying that with public schools we are required both teaching democratic citizenship and citizen or declarant aliens status for teachers."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1426.564,1437.968,"Your Honor, the point I'm trying to make is not that there is a separate and independent equal protection violation because of the different citizenship requirements for private school teachers and for public school teacher."
1978.76-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.156,1475.011,But isn't that an equally rational inference that the state perhaps felt that private schools would not be quite a sure of fulfilling that interest but nonetheless in the interest of preserving autonomy of the private schools shows not to force them the way they chose to force the public schools?
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1475.011,1477.098,"Well, Your Honor that's entirely a matter of speculation."
1978.76-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.098,1477.146,Yes.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1477.146,1483.302,There's nothing in the record of this case or in the legislative history of either of those statutes that could properly answer your question on that point.
1978.76-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.302,1486.404,I agree it's speculative.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1486.404,1512.383,"I think that entirely apart from the private school point, this statue is also under inclusive because under a regulation issued by appellants, aliens who are barred by a federal statute from becoming citizens or even from filing declarations of intent to become citizens are nevertheless permitted in some circumstances to teach even in the public schools."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.374,1651.53,"Well you have read the argument for a perfectly tailored statute now, aren't you?"
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1651.53,1652.067,"No, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.067,1664.564,"It's always easy to take any statute in any area under the scrutiny of litigated case, think about ways that it could be made more merely ideal."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1664.564,1684.304,"That's correct Your Honor, we're not arguing for a perfect match here but I do believe that based on the factors identified in our brief that this particular statute is substantially and impermissibly under and over inclusive not just that there is a small difference but that there is a great difference, a difference of constitutional significance."
1978.76-808,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1684.304,1688.254,You've use the word necessary to attain the state objective.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1693.367,1695.224,"Well, certainly that's the terminology of strict scrutiny."
1978.76-808,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1695.224,1697.468,I thought you're arguing rational basis?
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1697.468,1705.27,I'm arguing both Your Honor but let me turn to that point and say to the Court what I believe strict scrutiny is in fact the appropriate standard to be applied in this case.
1978.76-808,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1705.27,1711.95,"Well, I thought you just said even under the rational basis, you would think the statute is invalid."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1711.95,1712.998,I did say that Your Honor.
1978.76-808,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1712.998,1717.177,"But in that context, you use the word necessary without a slip of the tongue."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1717.177,1718.472,"Well, actually not Your Honor."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.093,1781.716,"It is also higher education, was it not?"
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1781.716,1784.219,"It was financial assistance for higher education, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.219,1786.542,"Graduate indeed, Graduate Education."
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1786.542,1801.147,"That's correct Your Honor and as I believe you pointed out in your opinion in that case, well that was a lesser interest of the plaintiffs involved than it would be the interest in this case which is a right to employment which you described in that case as a fundamental personal interest."
1978.76-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.378,1811.642,We haven't reverse I think in Mauclet and Foley.
1978.76-808,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1811.642,1817.139,"I'm sorry, I was -- I'm sorry, I was talking about Mauclet, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2856.842,2860.333,I only have possibly one sentence further Your Honor.
1978.76-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.748,2903.84,"Mrs. Gordon, let me just ask one question if I â€“ I don't think it's repetitious but is there a characteristic of alienage, the class that's affected by this rule that has any relevance to their teaching ability and if so, what is it?"
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2903.84,2905.734,Is there a characteristic that affect?
1978.76-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.025,2973.76,I'm sorry I really did not understand your answer.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2979.956,2984.136,The capacity to participate in democratic decision-making.
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.136,2991.29,And then applies to everybody from a social science teacher to a printing teacher?
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2991.29,2992.186,It requires --
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.186,2994.052,To a printing teacher?
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2995.909,3021.307,"That is correct because all teachers are examples and in that way communicate values and attitudes but perhaps more significantly Your Honor, because in New York as indeed in every other state of which I am familiar at least, the curriculum for teachers for example in nursery through sixth grade includes all subject matters."
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.116,3035.008,They didn't teach kindergarten any printing?
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3035.008,3039.369,"No, because we don't offer printing in nursery through sixth grades."
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3042.894,3044.219,I'm talking about elementary students.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3044.219,3050.307,"Elementary school, no sir, we don't teach printing and all teachers and elementary school teach all subject matter."
1978.76-808,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3050.307,3053.016,Isn't there a rather simple answer into the question --
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.016,3054.641,"Well, wait a minute."
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3059.2,3060.775,You mean the high school performing arts?
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.775,3061.681,Yes.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3061.681,3063.098,But we just merely talking about --
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3063.098,3064.675,"Well, isn't that a public school?"
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3064.675,3071.191,"No, the example you gave me Your Honor was nursery through sixth grade and that's how we excluded the printing example."
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.042,3084.164,We're talking about all the schools in New York.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3090.04,3091.926,Which are not departmentalized?
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.926,3095.959,They are completely departmentalized in elementary schools.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3095.959,3101.686,"Well, Your Honor in New York secondary schools may or may not be departmentalized."
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.222,3122.659,And mop the floor?
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3122.659,3124.014,"Well, I don't think mop the floor Your Honor."
1978.76-808,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.014,3125.651,"Well, yes."
1978.76-808,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3125.651,3130.892,"There is shallow, I wonder that you can navigate in response to these some of these questions."
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3151.534,3152.732,That's exactly so.
1978.76-808,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.732,3160.255,That certainly relates to the role model if it doesn't affect the substance of the teaching.
1978.76-808,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3160.255,3162.532,"That's absolutely true, Your Honor."
1978.76-808,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3164.877,3165.715,Thank you counsel.
