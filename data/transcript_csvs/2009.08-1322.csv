2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.712,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1322, Astrue v. Ratliff."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,9.901,21.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EAJA provides that in an appropriate case a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party."
2009.08-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,99.832,115.359,Isn't it true that the Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA awards directly to attorneys and that this is still done in cases in which the client has assigned the payment to an attorney?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,115.359,118.311,That is true in part.
2009.08-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,186.844,192.0,What gives the Federal Government the right to override State law on that issue?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,214.271,215.628,--I don't believe so.
2009.08-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.183,269.2,What authority does a court have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,269.2,272.18,"Well, it certainly doesn't lie in EAJA."
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,325.532,331.889,What would happen in the case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this prevailing party?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,341.681,346.976,"The attorney fee under EAJA is payable to the prevailing party, which would be the prisoner."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.228,379.943,So how can the court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is what the statute says?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,379.943,382.068,"They are not trumping it, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,417.007,419.211,Do you actually have to transfer it or--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,419.211,420.63,--Well--
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,420.63,423.863,"--I mean, the statute says pay the prevailing party."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,423.863,424.456,--Correct.
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,424.456,426.223,"And you're saying the court can say: No, pay the lawyer."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,426.223,427.989,Well--
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,427.989,428.644,In certain--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,428.644,433.767,--In order to recognize the agreement between the party and the attorney.
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.767,437.14,Where is the agreement between the party and the attorney?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,452.976,454.505,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.805,468.641,"You said that pursuant -- maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that there is a contract between the prevailing party and the attorney."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,481.326,501.206,"--Well, as this Court recognized in Venegas in the section 1988 context, it's commonplace either for there to be an expressed or an implied agreement to pay over any statutory award that the prevailing party may receive to the attorney."
2009.08-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.54,532.772,Doesn't -- doesn't the government setoff depend upon who owns the money under State law?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,551.17,556.465,"Well, that might be true if we were relying on a common law offset."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,597.636,599.98,--What if the client is bankrupt?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,601.009,603.291,--The same rule would apply.
2009.08-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.324,657.955,"Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,665.922,667.22,"Well, sure."
2009.08-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.641,668.499,What?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,668.499,670.53,"--As we indicated in our brief, there's several things that can be done."
2009.08-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.88,740.531,"In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer says: Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,758.179,759.836,--That -- that's correct.
2009.08-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,759.836,761.084,And has that ever happened?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,761.084,764.866,I don't know that that's happened in this offset context.
2009.08-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.866,765.225,But it could now.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,766.925,767.986,"It could well happen, and in fact--"
2009.08-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.986,771.125,"Well, what's -- what's the authority for the government to enter into the agreement?"
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,771.125,772.654,--The authority--
2009.08-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.654,776.093,"I mean, if the statute says there has to be an offset, that's it."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,776.093,784.165,"--Well, the statute also provides, under section 3711, for the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for agencies."
2009.08-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.131,793.492,But do the guidelines reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,793.492,822.322,"Well, the statute actually reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at section 3716 -- this is at page 9a of the government's brief's appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to implementing an administrative offset must advise -- this is on a4 -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim."
2009.08-1322,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,833.552,844.642,"Could you tell me what would motivate the government to agree to give to a lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, thinks it's entitled to?"
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,856.996,862.37,"Well, I think the hypothetical was premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at the end."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,890.543,899.289,"Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the government's position, to get fees, is substantially unjustified."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,909.705,910.376,"Well, not at all."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.217,920.779,"Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we were talking about, the attorney's interest is."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,926.808,936.771,"--This is a separate question, which is whether there is really any deterrent or how large the deterrent effect would be having the specter of a fee offset."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.946,978.628,"Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's -- and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is an agreement already in effect."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,983.113,985.613,--I may have misspoken--
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.613,990.14,That would be the first piece of -- that would be the first piece of evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get EAJA fees.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,993.17,993.966,--Let me back up.
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.699,1042.324,"No, but say he goes in to the government and says, look, I'm about to sue you, and I'd like to sit down and negotiate a nice agreement about the repayment."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1042.324,1050.099,"--Well, I guess the attorney may say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly is not motivated because of the lawsuit."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1054.427,1058.082,Government lawyers are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: I'm going to sue you.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1059.489,1062.547,"--Well, I guess that certainly gets our attention."
2009.08-1322,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.039,1099.284,"--The problem with your argument is this pot of money is actually not going to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing party and is entitled to get the award."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1105.204,1106.42,"--Well, actually, either--"
2009.08-1322,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.42,1128.132,"I don't know what the -- I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when they have to not only do the work in the case, but now have to do the work for the government in getting their client to negotiate an agreement with the government on something that's completely unrelated to the claim."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1128.132,1129.271,--I guess a--
2009.08-1322,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1129.271,1130.456,It's -- it's sort of--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1130.456,1130.85,--There's a few answers--
2009.08-1322,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.85,1131.318,--illogical.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1131.318,1132.347,--There's a few answers to that.
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.676,1178.358,That sounds like you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1202.394,1212.643,"--That may be true in the Social Security context, but there are many instances in which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that, you know, clients and -- and -- and their -- their attorneys work out fee arrangements."
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.81,1227.418,Is it--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1227.418,1233.602,Congress directed -- the language is very clear: Courts shall award to the prevailing party fees and expenses--
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1233.602,1234.351,--And does that mean--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1234.351,1234.803,--incurred by the party.
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1234.803,1236.893,--The award goes to the prevailing party.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1242.626,1243.842,I--
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.842,1245.593,--is taxable income to the client?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1245.593,1250.702,"--This is -- the answer to that is complicated and, generally, yes."
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.614,1316.221,"Like pain and suffering, but that's not--"
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1316.221,1326.465,"--Yes, so, but also certain Federal benefits, including Social Security benefits, have a very complicated tax relationship."
2009.08-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.554,1349.427,"--And then, in turn, income to the attorney when -- if the client--"
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1349.427,1350.225,--Correct.
2009.08-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1363.234,1375.136,It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would have been put to you by the court -- is that the government has somehow benefited because the money is created to offset the debt.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1389.599,1390.472,That's correct.
2009.08-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.956,1395.876,It's just paying itself from one account to the other.
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1395.876,1396.235,That's correct.
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1414.305,1422.367,"The government zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a legal position in court against a small business that was substantially unjustified."
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1422.367,1429.206,And it has paid its EAJA award by offsetting that award against the debt that the business owed to the United States.
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1435.877,1436.485,But I think the idea -- well--
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1436.485,1438.829,--From the perspective of the prevailing party as well.
2009.08-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1466.021,1472.768,Do you happen to know how much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year under these EAJA offsets?
2009.08-1322,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1475.094,1490.619,"We don't, and the reason we don't is because each agency that -- which is the subject of an EAJA order submits to Treasury a payment request based on that order, and they check ""miscellaneous payment""."
2009.08-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.338,1537.258,"--Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1541.926,1571.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I'd like to discuss with you this morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal services she performed, that Congress invited her to perform, to show that the government's position was legally erroneous and was not even substantially justified."
2009.08-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.49,1666.534,The prevailing party gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of the debt she owed to the government.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1667.891,1681.825,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who -- because the question is who has the beneficial interest in the fee payment?"
2009.08-1322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1688.696,1691.133,Isn't this argument circular?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1705.565,1712.202,"Two responses, if I could, Justice Alito: First, the word ""payment"" gets thrown around a lot in the briefs."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.136,1801.633,"On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1817.786,1821.408,--If -- I'm not--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.408,1825.564,"The trust first owes -- the trust owes $1,000 to the government."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1831.044,1832.061,--Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.061,1833.918,The government couldn't offset that?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1833.918,1835.2,Of course it could.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.2,1835.652,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1836.292,1837.025,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.025,1843.117,But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1843.117,1843.757,Well--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.757,1847.458,The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1847.458,1856.235,"--If I understood your hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $500, then the trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the payment."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.235,1858.36,It's not entitled to the benefit of the $500.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1865.512,1865.761,I--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.761,1868.448,--it can't -- you agree that that couldn't be?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1868.448,1870.496,--Well--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.496,1874.93,"Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on your first argument."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1875.647,1876.01,--Okay.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.706,1888.987,I--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.987,1898.779,"Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money that he has just gotten from the government, including the attorney's fees."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1918.381,1919.13,"All right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1919.13,1924.862,"Well, let me -- can trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1924.862,1926.562,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.562,1927.217,"Yes, I don't either."
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1933.313,1939.482,"I'm having trouble with this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from State to State."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1969.797,1971.969,That's--
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1971.969,1973.7,And that's just -- that's just the law of offsets.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1973.7,1974.356,--That's true.
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1974.356,1975.638,"Because again, it's the same party."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1980.134,1982.119,I think that's true.
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1982.119,1987.586,And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for is just contrary to the standard law of offsets.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1987.586,1989.243,"Well, Your Honor, with what I--"
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.243,1994.847,And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be this offset first as a matter of priority.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,1994.847,2003.831,"--Actually, Your Honor, the Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department."
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.011,2026.148,"Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the employer who is entitled to an offset."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2026.148,2026.866,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.156,2046.967,"Well, how is it different?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2051.027,2051.838,--Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.838,2055.741,It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2055.741,2056.177,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.177,2063.518,And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise give to a payee.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2064.501,2065.078,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.078,2071.154,"And then you've defined ""payee"" as a person who has some beneficial interest in that money."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2071.154,2071.575,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.575,2081.336,And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether he's a person or whether he's a trust.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2084.038,2085.131,"I understand, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.131,2085.415,Okay.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2085.415,2094.222,And my point about the statute is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation which looks to who's entitled to benefit.
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.222,2095.564,"Okay, let's take the regulation:"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2128.286,2139.079,"Not so, Your Honor, in Social Security cases, which this is, and in Veterans cases, which together account for more than 90 percent of all EAJA awards."
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.592,2188.229,"And in those cases, you agree the offset can be made?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2188.229,2188.966,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.131,2206.975,--In exchange for getting 25 percent of the recovery?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2206.975,2207.864,No.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2218.813,2237.258,My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2237.258,2237.789,That's true.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.789,2248.442,"So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 25 percent?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2248.442,2249.861,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.28,2256.732,And that was because it was too small to be bothered with?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2258.046,2261.465,She did not apply for a 25 percent fee.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2266.106,2268.353,And she could keep only one from the--
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2268.353,2269.979,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2269.979,2272.15,--She could keep only the larger of the two.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2272.15,2274.256,"Had she received the EAJA fee, she could have kept it."
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.256,2295.999,"One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't exempt Equal Access to Justice fees."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2295.999,2296.701,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.986,2513.342,"Well, you say that in Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept pay-as-you-go?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2514.06,2515.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.277,2525.54,--But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract between the attorney and the Social Security recipient.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2525.54,2526.476,I agree.
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.945,2533.44,"Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the recipient."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2533.44,2535.924,"Yes, that's what I was trying to say, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.924,2539.454,"Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2551.858,2557.544,"Yes, but that obligation exists only to the extent of the EAJA fee."
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.235,2577.657,Is it--
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2577.657,2578.893,--We have been talking -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2578.893,2599.057,"--Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute you view them as blocked from--"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2599.057,2599.463,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2599.463,2604.537,--from seeking anything other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2604.537,2607.068,"Yes, that's what 406(b)(2) says, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2607.068,2616.613,"So that once the offset happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had other money, the attorney would be blocked from going after it?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2616.613,2617.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2617.44,2622.486,Because by the terms of the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2622.486,2623.921,They can only seek what?
2009.08-1322,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2623.921,2626.67,Either the EAJA fee or the 406 fee.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2626.67,2636.4,"Yes, and we have been talking as if EAJA fees and 406(b) fees are sort of contemporaneous in every case."
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.777,2663.697,"Do you calculate the fee under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending on the case?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2666.384,2667.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.182,2672.022,The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2672.022,2677.88,"--No, section 3 says how this works, of the -- of EAJA 1985."
2009.08-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.128,2683.581,Right.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2683.581,2687.032,--and sends the smaller to the client and vice versa.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.8,2730.921,In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is there an EAJA fee?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2730.921,2734.716,Forty-six percent.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.831,2900.003,I don't understand your earlier point.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2900.003,2900.471,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.471,2904.375,Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2904.375,2905.018,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.018,2908.0,His house is being foreclosed on--
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2908.0,2908.578,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2908.578,2910.309,--all his bank accounts are attached.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2914.498,2914.982,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2914.982,2919.26,"And it's $5,000 of money and 1,000 for the fee."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2928.071,2930.053,Are we talking about the government?
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2930.053,2930.895,I'm making this up.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2944.126,2945.514,Is this in a Social Security--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2945.514,2946.189,I'm making it up.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2948.763,2949.016,--Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.016,2949.718,--a hypothetical.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2949.718,2950.56,"Yes, it is."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.966,2951.652,All right?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2951.652,2952.136,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.136,2952.732,You follow that.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2953.372,2953.684,I think so.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.684,2954.23,Okay.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2967.586,2970.679,"Outside the Social Security context, yes, I think so."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.679,2970.882,All right.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2978.783,2982.702,The bank could not take it because of the anti-assignment provision--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.702,2984.449,"It couldn't take 1,000?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2984.449,2986.107,--Couldn't take any of it under--
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.107,2986.793,Couldn't take any of it.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2987.37,2988.466,--42 U.S.C. 407.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2988.466,2989.761,Is that in here?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,2989.761,2998.772,"Yes, 42 U.S.C. 407 -- it's cited, if it's not quoted -- prohibits assignment of Social Security benefits."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.053,3003.693,And the EAJA fee counts as a Social Security benefit?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3003.693,3006.13,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.971,3012.533,"I changed it and said, now, how does it matter if it's Social Security?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3013.688,3032.149,"If it's an EAJA fee in a Social Security context, the bank cannot take that because of the Federal -- well, because the attorney -- the government admits the constructive trust exists in favor of the attorney with respect to those funds."
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.149,3033.662,If you win this case?
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3033.662,3033.927,No.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.301,3037.88,"In other words -- in other words, no one can attach?"
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3044.455,3046.764,Yes.
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.764,3047.61,Okay.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3047.61,3050.481,"And I wanted to get back to the point you asked, Justice Breyer--"
2009.08-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.481,3051.058,"Well, skip my points."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3053.414,3058.862,"--Well -- but during -- during Mr. Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this repayment agreement."
2009.08-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.414,3205.674,I thought the -- I thought the government said they only did that when -- when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3205.674,3209.613,--Mr. Yang was talking about from 2006 on.
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3215.485,3219.654,Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't offsetting.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3219.654,3229.087,"Two responses, Your Honor: The offset came into the picture in 1996, but the government says it wasn't practical to 2005."
2009.08-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.536,3290.875,"But Congress has provided in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406, that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the attorney."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3295.793,3309.348,"--Just two points, Justice Ginsburg: Number one, we get back to this question about does payment mean who receives the check or who is entitled to benefit from it?"
2009.08-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3346.117,3347.49,--Go ahead.
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3347.49,3348.036,Thank you.
2009.08-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.567,3353.846,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1322,1,31379,james_d_leach,,3353.846,3355.503,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."

2009.08-1322,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3358.393,3371.37,I believe I heard counsel concede that EAJA fees outside of the Social Security context are payable to the prevailing party and therefore subject to offset.

2009.08-1322,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3447.15,3462.845,"--(b)(2), that if these attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside of those granted--"

2009.08-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.103,3500.455,"Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of the time in Social Security cases the government's position is unjustified, and 70 percent of the time in Veterans cases?"
2009.08-1322,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3500.455,3504.873,"--Well, I think that reflects the stakes often, Your Honor."
2009.08-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3511.542,3513.117,So whenever it really makes a difference--

2009.08-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.415,3517.476,--70 percent of the time the government's position is substantially unjustified?

2009.08-1322,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3527.112,3531.955,"--It was, I believe, in the order of either 50 or maybe slightly more than 50 percent."

2009.08-1322,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3547.666,3551.617,"--It is an unfortunate number, Your Honor."
