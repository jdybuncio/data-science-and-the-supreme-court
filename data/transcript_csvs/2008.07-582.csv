2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.103,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-582, Federal Communications Commission versus Fox Television Stations."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,10.681,33.157,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a challenge to the efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to carry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464, and more even-handedly address indecent material that is broadcast directly into the home during the time of day when children are likely to be in the viewing audience."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.803,60.443,Did it -- did it reconsider its policy?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,80.653,93.148,"They did change the policy, Justice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged that in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, which is not reprinted in the petition appendix."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.176,116.856,"The latest order, the one that's up here, says that all of the statements to that effect in the past were simply staff statements and that the Commission had never held to that effect before."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,116.856,122.46,"Well, the court of appeals recognized, and we think correctly so, that the Commission did change its position on that."
2008.07-582,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.494,157.446,"Well, is the agency's position that its policy has changed or that it has not changed?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,157.446,164.461,"That it has changed, Justice Kennedy, and the court of appeals recognized that at pages 20a to 21a of the decision."
2008.07-582,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.927,173.563,"Well, the court recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,173.563,177.859,"--Well, I think there were some statements, we would acknowledge that, in different places."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.1,208.362,"But I think it rewrote that in its last order, and I think it even explained away the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as categorical as it might appear."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,208.362,233.318,"--I think if you look at maybe pages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we discuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect to the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard Music Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that in applying its contextual analysis in the past it focused on whether or not expletives were repeated or dwelled upon."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,245.707,253.39,"Do you think, in terms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether it's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior policy?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,253.39,264.839,"Certainly, I would be defending it if the Court thought that it wasn't a change, and it would have been inappropriate for the Second Circuit to invalidate that as arbitrary and capricious."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,275.3,284.956,"I guess my question is, do you think a different legal standard applies when an agency changes a prior position as opposed to articulating its position for the first time?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,284.956,292.888,"--Well, this Court has said that it's desirable for agencies to reconsider and to change its policy from time to time, but when--"
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.888,307.819,"Wasn't the Commission -- the Commission asked the Second Circuit, said: We've changed our policy; we want you to remand the case to the Commission so the Commission can explain what its new policy."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,318.378,321.954,"--It is, and it did in the remand order reprinted in the petition appendix."
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.855,395.674,"One of the problems is that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission has made."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,425.209,429.1,"Well, we do think, of course, that there is rhyme or reason to its determination."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,494.933,506.846,"I suppose the most difficult case for you is the ""Early News"" case where you have just a fleeting expletive, unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the others."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,510.832,519.905,"The Commission has determined that news programming would be treated differently, with greater restraint, because of the different values present in that situation."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,519.905,534.697,"So the same -- if you had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher exhibits, they -- they could use the actual language, even though they can't during the -- the awards shows?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,534.697,535.352,Yes.
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.219,604.166,Are there only those two words in the FCC's new policy or are there other words on the list?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,604.166,619.331,"Well, certainly, the FCC's action in this case focuses on the use of the F-Word and the S-Word, and I think everyone acknowledges that a word like the F-Word is one of the most graphic, explicit, and vulgar words in the English language for sexual activity."
2008.07-582,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.848,633.296,Isn't it true that -- isn't it true that that is a word that often is used with -- with no reference whatsoever to the -- the sexual connotation?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,633.296,636.716,--It can be -- it certainly can be used in a non-literal way.
2008.07-582,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.191,660.187,You think it's equally -- it's equally subject to being treated as indecent within the meaning of the statute regardless of which meaning was actually apparent to everybody who listened to it?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,660.187,683.179,"I wouldn't say equally, Justice Stevens, but what we would say is that it can qualify as indecent under the -- under the Commission's definition, because even the non-literal use of a word like the F-Word, because of the core meaning of that word as one of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit words for sexual activity in the English language, it inevitably conjures up a core sexual image."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.179,685.039,"Which is, indeed, why it's used."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,685.039,699.486,"Which is, indeed, why it's used as an intensifier or as an insult, and it's why the networks themselves -- and this is reprinted, I believe, at 86 of the petition appendix -- have a 24-hour rule that the F-Word generally should not be use on TV."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,699.486,708.123,"But that is an entirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have no objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis after 10:00 o'clock?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,708.123,715.697,"Outside of the safe harbor under this Court's decision, the -- the Commission recognizes that networks can use indecent language."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.697,717.167,"Although they don't, I gather."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,717.167,718.025,Although they don't.
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.884,721.039,"Because they find it offensive, I gather."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,721.039,732.301,"Because I think they recognize that it contravenes community standards for appropriateness in the broadcast medium, and that -- those policies are reprinted at pages 86a to 88a of--"
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.301,738.174,How are the contemporary community standards determined in this context?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,748.948,752.871,"--Well, first of all, the community standards are community standards for the broadcast medium."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.752,786.792,"Well, I suppose the broadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use that -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what they think about community standards."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,786.792,787.498,--Absolutely.
2008.07-582,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.277,796.069,Are you talking about community standards for broadcasting?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,796.069,798.663,"Community standards for broadcasting, that's right."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,832.152,835.54,"Still, I gather that's at issue with the constitutional questions."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,858.077,861.328,"--We think it is, and we think it is reflected in the Court's cases."
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.066,881.005,Can I -- can I ask?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,882.331,899.48,"Well, if -- if I can answer the question as to the force of the Court's precedents, this Court has repeatedly affirmed in cases like Sable, in cases like Reno, in cases like Turner and Denver Area, that broadcasting is subject to a different and lesser First Amendment standard."
2008.07-582,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.683,939.961,"Yes, but wasn't the rationale for the lesser standard largely the scarcity of the frequencies?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,939.961,942.617,--I think that was the rationale in Red -- Red Lion.
2008.07-582,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.553,947.024,But it relied on it in Red Lion?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,947.024,948.256,Yes.
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,967.906,969.622,That was before the Internet.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,973.292,974.62,"It was, Your Honor."
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.839,1050.539,I just have a practical question.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1084.746,1095.805,"--With respect to live entertainment programming, Justice Breyer, you can do what the networks now do, which is to have a tape delay which permits you to bleep out isolated or offensive--"
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1095.805,1098.628,"So, what they -- what they now -- they now do this?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1110.549,1111.064,--No.
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.776,1125.574,I'm not talking about breaking news coverage.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1141.659,1143.972,"--Well, I don't think -- that's not--"
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.972,1146.05,Or are you saying they all have to use a delay?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1146.05,1151.031,"--In a show like the Billboard Music Awards, they will use a delay."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.915,1166.476,"They had a 5-second delay at the time these things occurred, didn't they?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1166.476,1167.4,"They did, and I think--"
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.4,1169.868,And it wasn't -- it wasn't that they weren't fast enough or something?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1169.868,1176.506,"--Well, if you look at the Nicole Richie example, they actually bleeped one word that was used, I believe--"
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.506,1177.239,"Right, right."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1177.239,1178.521,--before she got to the other two words.
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.375,1187.689,"It depends on whom you are dealing with, right?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1187.689,1188.75,I think that's right.
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.717,1207.834,"Did the FCC explain all this in its opinion when it said, we understand that now we're going to have to -- every incident is going to have to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have to have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1209.211,1210.553,--It explained that--
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.553,1211.429,I didn't see it.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1211.429,1218.472,--in its decision in the petition appendix here as to the basis why enforcement action would be appropriate.
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.63,1255.116,This Paris Hilton incident was scripted.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1261.144,1264.938,Certainly our view is that it was pandering and invited.
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.67,1267.984,Wasn't there a different word?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1273.201,1280.557,"The euphemism in the script I think was ""freaking"", and another euphemism for the S-Word, but they obviously departed from that."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.695,1283.242,But it was sort of an invitation.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1289.801,1291.771,--That's what Paris Hilton said.
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.021,1294.754,It was a setup.
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1294.754,1306.952,"--to invite this kind of abuse, which is one of the contextual factors that the Commission looked at, along with the extremely shocking and graphic nature of using this language at 9:00 p.m. on an eastern night."
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.952,1308.762,"But you didn't fine them, anyway, did you?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1308.762,1318.697,We did not fine them because we exercised restraint in making -- in attempting to make clear that the FCC going forward was going to consider isolated--
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.697,1324.944,"Because you had gone from Pacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this kind of thing would have been okay?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1324.944,1342.075,"--We had gone from Pacifica until 1987, approximately, in the Action for Children's Television case, where the Commission determined that that approach limited only to the seven dirty words in Pacifica was unduly narrow and inconsistent with its enforcement responsibilities."
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.075,1355.993,"Remind me about that, because there was -- the statement that the networks don't do this at all at the time of Action for Children's Television, the fight was, was it going to be from midnight 'til whatever it was."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1366.926,1370.798,But I don't -- my understanding was that was not pertaining to use of the F-Word.
2008.07-582,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.865,1413.361,"Maybe I shouldn't ask this, but is there ever appropriate for the Commission to take into consideration at all the question whether the particular remark was really hilarious, very, very funny?"
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1420.482,1427.244,"Yes, insofar as the Commission takes into account whether it's shocking, titillating, pandering--"
2008.07-582,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.244,1427.809,"Oh, it's funny."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1431.464,1452.22,"--Well, my point is that we will take it into account, but I think you can recognize the potentially greater harmful impact on children where you have celebrities using particularly graphic, vulgar, explicit, indecent language as part of the comedic routine during a show that children are comprising a substantial part of the viewing audience."
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.575,1465.744,"Could you review me to one thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me."
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1504.902,1505.339,Right.
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.339,1508.713,So is there an explanation why they made that change?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1508.713,1512.335,"Well, prong 1 hasn't changed, Justice Breyer, since the time--"
2008.07-582,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.335,1512.803,It hasn't?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1512.803,1513.396,--of Pacifica.
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.149,1547.134,May I just ask one question?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1586.995,1595.005,"--Well, that approach would be consistent with this Court not deciding issues that haven't been decided below and the general practice of constitutional avoidance."
2008.07-582,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1635.584,1641.767,Could that be -- could that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced to decide that?
2008.07-582,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1641.767,1649.044,"Well, we think the Court is forced to decide that because that's the basis that the court of appeals has invalidated the Commission's action."
2008.07-582,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.622,1657.213,"Thank you, General Garre."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1660.995,1679.472,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would like to start with Justice Scalia's narrowest question in terms of the easiest way to resolve this case, which is did the FCC in its remand order in fact recognize that it had made a change in policy and therefore dealt forthrightly with the fact that it had made a change in policy."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.902,1694.932,"Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't the ability to discern it come from the reasons given for not assessing fines?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1707.177,1712.239,"--It -- well, that they are in fact adopting a new policy, I think that is probably right, Justice Souter."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.061,1731.104,Are they -- are they supposed to be more virtuous than courts?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1731.104,1732.387,Yes.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.387,1736.431,"I mean, courts all the time, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying,"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1765.046,1771.011,"The only thing that's strikingly different about that, Justice Scalia, is they are very express in dealing with issue in the Golden Globes order, which--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.011,1771.448,--It--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1771.448,1773.039,--General Garre specifically identifies.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.687,1799.151,"--Well -- it was also, they said, you know, we sort of made this change without getting comments from the affected parties."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1799.151,1799.962,That was part of it.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.962,1803.383,Give us a chance to receive comments and then -- and then explain.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1803.383,1810.241,"And then provide a final reviewable order from the Commission, presumably that defends in all respects that decision."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.896,1819.112,What the Commission said is that the prior decisions or guidance was seriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was appropriate to disavow it.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1824.08,1824.516,--Right.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.918,1842.4,That seems to me to be the same question that I asked your friend: does it matter?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1862.626,1874.15,--This Court said in State Farm that when an agency changes its position it is incumbent upon the agency to provide more of an explanation in that context than -- than if it were adopting the position in the first instance.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.028,1882.46,What it says in State Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an agency's view of what is in the public interest may change either with or without a change in circumstances.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1882.46,1882.85,--Right.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.85,1885.584,The reason there is a change is they looked at it and they decided it was wrong.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1885.584,1886.898,Yes.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.14,1912.918,You agree it's enough of a justification for the change that they think the other policy was wrong?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1920.118,1921.615,--And then explain why.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1921.615,1922.524,And then explain why.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1922.524,1958.821,"And that goes into what I think is the next point that I would like to make which is the answer to the Justice Breyer's question, which is where in the opinion does the Commission explain the change in position with respect to the -- to the first prong of the indecency standard, which is whether or not these words inherently mean either sexual or excretory activities; and there, it seems to me, there is a -- whether there is a change or not, the reality is that from 1978 until 2004 this kind of language was used routinely, without the Commission remotely suggesting that every time it was used, it necessarily had a particular meaning."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.329,1976.938,They said that.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1998.93,2014.611,"--This Court expressly said in Cohen v California, in talking about exactly the same word, that it cannot plausibly be maintained that this vulgar allusion would conjure up such -- up such psychic stimulation."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.594,2020.078,But that's not the Commission's position.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2037.649,2047.628,"Well, all that Cohen says is that you cannot immediately jump -- you -- it wouldn't even remotely strike you that the reason the language is being used is for its particular sexual meaning."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.628,2053.345,Then why -- why do you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or force?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2053.345,2057.86,The same reason the S-Word does; it's because in some circles it is inappropriate.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.86,2061.748,Because it is associated with sexual or excretory activity.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2063.95,2069.336,"I mean, I -- to say that, I suppose you can say it, but I don't understand on what basis."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.773,2072.443,Of course there is.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2072.443,2074.663,--anything in the record that remotely suggests that.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.663,2078.395,Don't use golly waddles in -- instead of the F-Word.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2078.803,2086.36,"People use all kinds of euphemisms for it, and nobody blinks about it."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2097.186,2098.496,"Well, one thing has changed."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2160.627,2170.578,"I think it probably would, if all you are doing is looking at just the sort of raw Administrative Procedure Act standard, as it would normally apply to non-content."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.578,2173.183,"Well, the raw APA standard issue is what we've got here."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2173.183,2176.216,"Well, I -- I don't think that's a fair way to -- to look at this case."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.724,2193.16,If that's--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2193.16,2194.818,--In a more content-restrictive way.
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2194.818,2219.852,"--If that's the case, then the concept of constitutional avoidance is -- is somehow out of this case and similar First Amendment cases, because we are always going to -- and I -- when you say you really cannot separate that precisely, we were always going to be getting into the constitutional issue, either expressly because we accept your view or covertly because we said, boy, we know what's around the corner."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2221.572,2222.617,But that would only be--
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2222.617,2224.898,"--if we accept your argument, we have to change the constitutional avoidance doctrine."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2224.898,2233.517,"--No, I don't think that's exactly right, Justice Souter, because the constitutional avoidance doctrine is not going to be much of a problem obviously unless there is a grave constitutional threat."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.586,2268.659,And I thought we've held that the Court can't engage in such expansion of and additions to the Administrative Procedure Act.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2270.207,2273.252,"Well, the Administrative Procedure Act expressly says--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.252,2278.158,"--one of our landmark decisions that what it says, it says, and we cannot add additional procedures."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2285.716,2287.122,"--Well, the--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.122,2288.76,Not just--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2288.76,2294.804,"--The Administrative Procedure Act also says ""not in accordance with law"", which also refers to other statutes and obviously the Constitution."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.99,2300.178,--You are asking for a higher standard than the APA--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2300.178,2306.188,"Yes, I am asking for a higher standard under the APA because we are talking about content-based restrictions on free speech."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.188,2308.438,How is that consistent with Vermont Yankee?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2308.438,2312.641,"Because it was not talking about restrictions on speech, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.641,2316.763,"So, you are saying that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a particular area."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2317.902,2318.37,"Well, it--"
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.37,2319.477,--Which of our cases supports that?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2319.477,2331.601,"--This Court hasn't had to hold that in any particular context, but the reality is, as a logical matter, if you are thinking about -- you know, there is an -- a restriction on ""in accordance with law""."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.068,2335.536,"Well, maybe sometime--"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2335.536,2337.221,--And in order to avoid those issues--
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2337.221,2342.953,"--to be in a position to argue your constitutional issue, but we can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in applying the APA."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2342.953,2353.559,"--All I'm saying is that it seems to me a remarkably artificial inquiry, to look at this as if you are regulating the price of oil going through, to a pipeline as opposed to what you are talking about--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.559,2356.074,--You should have complained to the lower court about that.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2363.523,2364.072,--But--
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.072,2371.77,"But you went on the APA issue, and then you come up here and say: I don't want to -- I don't want to discuss the APA; I want to discuss, you know, the First Amendment."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2371.77,2377.767,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I am perfectly content to talk about the APA, because at the end of the day, the APA--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.767,2381.063,"The APA simpliciter; not the APA, you know--"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2381.063,2386.186,"--I like the more complicated version, but I am happy to deal with the simpliciter one as well."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2403.383,2404.662,Thank you.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2405.208,2406.74,But unfortunately that's not the position that the FCC took.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.74,2408.035,--He does good stuff now and then.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2408.663,2411.097,I have nothing but the highest regard for him.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.33,2461.076,"Well, when you talk about the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this change -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's adequately explained -- simply gets you in the door."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2476.385,2479.349,"Well, they are being lenient in one sense."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.548,2540.373,And this is where the context comes in.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2559.367,2571.612,"--Well, I'm not sure that -- I mean, I don't remember the FCC being in a position to describe how children are able to perceive one set of uses of the word as opposed to another set of uses of the word."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.891,2573.796,They perceive that.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2582.982,2602.254,"--You can't seriously believe that the average nine-year-old, first of all, who is probably more horrified by the arm being blown off to begin with, but putting that aside, you -- it cannot possibly be that the child has more of a reaction to that word in that context than if a young high school football player is running down the field screaming a particular expletive."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2602.254,2606.61,Why -- the young football player is not a celebrity that they follow.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2606.61,2611.625,"The young high school player actually might be more of a celebrity in some communities than -- at least than where I live, and--"
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2611.625,2616.793,The point is whether they are or not is the contextual determination that the FCC can undertake.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2630.148,2638.329,"--But the problem is, Mr. Chief Justice, once you open the door, then you end up with all of the vagueness and overbreadth problems that are inherent in this regime."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.329,2645.11,"These arguments apply not just to the isolated, once-upon-a-time use, but even to continued use."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2651.092,2653.482,"Justice Scalia, you could say the same thing--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.482,2653.856,That's not--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2653.856,2654.933,--but we're not saying the same thing.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.933,2657.183,"--That's not, I suppose, what you are arguing against here, is it?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2657.183,2662.869,"No, because the point we are making here is that we haven't asked this Court to revisit Pacifica."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.482,2726.418,Then why do your clients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2726.418,2727.885,Because it affects audience share.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.433,2731.383,Why do you think it affects audience share?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2731.383,2734.492,--Because some people are offended it; not the whole community.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.788,2750.299,"If you can take that into consideration, why can't the FCC make the same determination, that there may be some people offended by this, and if there are some people, as part of our statutory responsibility, we are going to look at it."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2752.128,2752.549,--But that's a heckler's veto.
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2752.549,2755.283,"--Not that they automatically impose a sanction, but that they're going to look at it."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2755.283,2767.808,"Well, first of all, that's a heckler's veto, and there have been long holdings in this Court that suggest simply pandering to one small segment of the population is no way to enforce First Amendment rights."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.963,2772.102,There goes Pacifica.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2772.102,2776.302,"No, I don't think there goes Pacifica, because Pacifica was only one person--"
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.302,2776.52,Isn't that a--
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2776.52,2776.786,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.786,2778.661,--Isn't that a heckler's veto?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2778.661,2779.129,No.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.519,2785.719,"What if people like, you know, going on and on with expletives and offensive words?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2794.715,2801.056,--But the problem is that the Chief Justice's question was: Why do we have a 24-hour rule.
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.095,2827.842,"If there is -- if there is a change in the community standards, does that justify a change in the FCC's policies?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2838.043,2838.651,Well--
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.651,2841.884,--as compared to what Pacifica was concerned with?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2841.884,2847.429,--I mean I -- I believe that society is significantly more tolerant of these words today than it was in -- 30 years ago.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.429,2849.035,Do you think your clients have had anything to do with that?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2849.648,2856.441,"In -- in the scheme of things, probably very, very little to do with that compared to the way the language is used."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.925,2870.67,"You do, indeed, but you don't have them presented as something that is -- is normal in polite company, which is what happens when it comes out in -- in television shows."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2883.77,2889.249,But the -- I mean I think what Justice Stevens is getting at is: What has changed over the last 30 years?
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.619,2905.79,More tolerant or more used to hearing it?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2905.79,2907.007,I think both.
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.007,2910.193,"Candidly, I think there is a difference."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2910.193,2922.722,"Well, I am not saying there is not a difference, but I am suggesting that there are -- that the -- that the change over time has -- has made this less of a compelling argument than it would have been, at least in my judgment, in -- in 1978."
2008.07-582,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2941.558,2942.809,I'm not sure that works.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2949.165,2953.068,"--Well, but if you put in a V-chip, it doesn't matter whether your parents are working or not."
2008.07-582,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2992.441,3000.673,"And you were -- you were pursuing the practical thing about the tapes, and so forth, when you got on to a different subject, which was the -- the nature of the program."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3020.354,3020.916,"Well, I--"
2008.07-582,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.916,3023.447,I am interested in the practical problem as part of this.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3025.397,3032.349,"--Well, the NAB amicus brief actually has a pretty good description of a variety of different instances in which this has -- has occurred."
2008.07-582,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3129.404,3136.462,"Mr. Phillips, this -- this is similar to the question that I asked General Garre."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3158.529,3159.017,"Yes, we did."
2008.07-582,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.017,3159.36,Yes.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3159.36,3160.218,I mean it wasn't a complaint.
2008.07-582,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.671,3163.092,Correct.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3163.092,3164.434,--going right to the Second Circuit.
2008.07-582,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.434,3164.827,Yes.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3164.827,3167.557,So it doesn't have the same bill of particulars that you might otherwise have.
2008.07-582,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.557,3172.197,"You could have just done the First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into it."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3172.197,3173.761,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.173,3193.25,"May I ask this question, Mr. Phillips?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3198.328,3199.545,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.545,3211.399,"And do you think that the word ""indecent"" can have -- that -- that a fleeting expletive could be not indecent, but the same words could be indecent if they are repeated several times?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3211.399,3213.572,I think it -- at least to me it's hard.
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.968,3242.076,"Yes, but I -- I am not -- not sure I make my question as clear as I should."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3245.325,3246.074,Yes.
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.074,3252.992,--does the -- does the number of times the word is used in a particular context make a difference in the definition?
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3252.992,3253.494,I apologize.
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.999,3284.448,"As a matter of statutory definition, if a particular word can describe those activities, it is equally indecent if used for a different purpose?"
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3284.448,3297.115,"--I -- I would have thought that, since you were dealing with a statute that is -- that imposes criminal sanctions, that if you have those two alternative interpretions available, you have to choose the one that is more favorable to the defendant."
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.799,3301.752,--would not be indecent.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3303.253,3303.753,--I am sorry?
2008.07-582,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.753,3304.486,--you should accept.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3314.983,3316.59,"That would be my argument, yes, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-582,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3316.59,3324.072,"But that -- I mean you are just -- correct me if I am wrong, but your colloquy with Justice Stevens sort of is a way of phrasing the issue in the case."
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3356.497,3358.775,"Well, I -- I agree with that completely, Justice Souter."
2008.07-582,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3375.266,3376.888,Let me ask about deferring there.
2008.07-582,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3390.37,3405.83,"Justice Scalia, the language of the statute itself would suggest that, because the statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may impose certain enforcement actions for people who violate section 1464."
2008.07-582,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.095,3445.063,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2008.07-582,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3447.032,3448.343,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-582,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3476.205,3486.543,"It explained -- I mean, the change I saw was that previously the use of these words as a swear was treated differently from the use of these words as a description."
2008.07-582,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3490.404,3494.665,It explains on page 74 why the Commission has determined that these words are indecent.
2008.07-582,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3521.046,3523.764,Could I ask one question that just occurred to me?
2008.07-582,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3528.697,3537.537,"I think it would probably qualify under the subject matter definition, but it probably wouldn't be patently offensive under community standards for broadcasting."
2008.07-582,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3552.282,3559.406,"You have the S-Word in there too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't understand why that word should be on the list."
2008.07-582,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3559.406,3565.465,"--Well, we certainly think that under community standards that that word is patently offensive as well."
2008.07-582,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3581.395,3583.754,"Thank you, General."
