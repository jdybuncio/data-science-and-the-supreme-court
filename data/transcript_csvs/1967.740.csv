1967.740,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.336,"Number 740, Brenda K. Monroe et al. versus Board of Commissioners of the City of Jackson, Tennessee."
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,25.3,28.606,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1967.740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.451,364.152,And that means that it was a free transfer system?
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,364.152,368.273,"Well, it didn't work out that way."
1967.740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.309,376.801,"No, I mean -- is that any different from the Kent County type of plans?"
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,376.801,383.759,"Well, it's not now but it was -- I was telling the events chronologically."
1967.740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.759,384.064,I see.
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,384.064,386.719,"Now, we have free choice just like New Kent."
1967.740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,591.132,593.301,And we have to peel off three layers before we--
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,593.301,600.669,"Yes, I think the simplest way to begin is to start with the basic map of the (Inaudible) layers –"
1967.740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.669,608.719,"That means to peel off the top three layers and we get to the beginning, is that it?"
1967.740,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,608.719,612.866,That's correct.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1509.665,1515.005,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.597,1709.381,I don't -- you say it shows who went to the various schools.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1711.316,1713.8,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1713.8,1736.617,"This then seems to show that at least some Negro children went to Tigrett Junior High because there are some blue dots inside that to the left of that green line and yet in your brief, it's indicated that no Negro children go to that junior high school."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1736.617,1743.442,The record that the -- the figures that Your Honors hold in Mr. Justice Stewart is of 1963.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.538,1753.013,I thought not maybe --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1753.013,1756.265,There are seven in Tigrett at this time.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.265,1756.939,"Seven, yes."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1756.939,1758.461,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.227,1773.049,"And this would indicate that each one of this dots represents five children as I understood it there are some 70 or so children represented by those blue dots, is that right?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1773.049,1780.004,"I think perhaps -- well, I can't really --"
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.004,1781.122,More or like 50 perhaps.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1781.122,1786.407,"I hope that the Court can see this, it's not too large."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.192,1832.033,"Mr. Rice, it may interest you to know that at least on this end of the bench you -- I just can't see any dots on your end."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1832.033,1840.362,"Mr. Justice White, I sympathize with my approval problem I have it myself but I wish that I could do something about it but --"
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.362,1842.808,It's nothing to do with bifocal it's --
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1842.808,1847.643,"I don't use bifocal, I can see --[Laughter]"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1847.643,1849.674,"Well sir, I'm learning to do anything that the Court suggest sir."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.674,1855.693,"Well, it just doesn't do a whole lot to refer to the map to those dots."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.355,1857.631,We can't see a dot up here.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1857.631,1859.707,Alright sir.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.401,1865.844,That is a miniature form?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1865.844,1866.81,Yes sir it is.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1868.268,1870.181,Is that in the record?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1870.181,1872.702,"Yes sir, it is."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1875.924,1878.827,The diagram I mean.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1878.827,1882.186,"This one is in the printed record, no sir."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1884.206,1887.063,Is there a miniature of that in the --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1887.063,1892.242,In the official record there is as an exhibit of this type but it is not printed in the Appendix.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1892.242,1894.217,Not in the Appendix.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1906.294,1907.345,Who attend the school?
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1907.345,1909.007,"Who attend the schools, yes."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1909.007,1910.064,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1921.267,1922.024,Which one is that?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1923.277,1926.989,"Well, you just want the junior highs Your Honor."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1926.989,1931.684,"First, I thought we would go to those three that represented by those --"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1931.684,1942.625,"Alright, the Tigrett Junior High School, this school out in the west has 812 White and 7 Negro children."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1947.209,1948.306,Yes.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1948.306,1952.664,The Jackson Junior High School which is the one to the east --
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1952.664,1953.319,Yes.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1953.319,1960.528,Has 349 White students and 135 Negro students.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1972.52,1980.435,Now why would that be that they are all Negroes there and no Whites?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1980.435,1987.771,Primarily Your Honor because the Negro children are preferring to go there and Whites are transferring out under the free transfer.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1987.771,1994.629,"But could it be also those various lines that you should draw there, the red lines that appear on your map?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1994.629,1995.11,No sir.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1995.11,1996.583,Do they have anything to do with it?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,1996.583,1997.811,I don't believe that it does.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1997.811,2004.275,Why were they drawn in that irregular line and going clear across the setting.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2004.275,2007.665,That's a fair question and I'm willing to give the Court a fair answer.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.378,2042.775,What's natural boundaries got to do with educational considerations?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2042.775,2046.448,"Well, it has this factor to consider Your Honor."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.243,2064.342,Is that one boundary seem to follow a freeway?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2064.342,2065.891,Are you speaking of this one Your Honor?
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.891,2066.652,Yes.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2066.652,2076.679,"This one follows a major highway until it reaches this point, the third west follows a major highway to this point and follows the railroad out of Jackson."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.679,2085.527,And how about to the -- under the north.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2085.527,2086.589,I was thinking of this one.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.589,2087.525,That's right.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2087.525,2099.935,"This boundary right here followed a major role all the way in town going in, you turn west on the major road, go south on the major road and goes out on a major road."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.935,2107.97,Now why does it -- there are other major roads around that they could have -- why is that one?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2107.97,2118.723,There is but this town is an old town and it's caught up in the little tiny square through here and they just simply didn't happen to be one there that we could use and that will show that to the Court.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.475,2166.908,"Mr. Rice, what was the -- in relation to what lines was it that the District Court found gerrymandering as to the elementary schools."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2168.281,2171.571,Yes sir only elementary level.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.295,2178.384,"Well, not too easily but I can see something that looks like --"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2178.384,2180.286,Let me say this.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.471,2229.515,And did he ever deal with an issue of gerrymandering on this junior high school line.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2229.515,2238.323,"Oh yes, we had an extended hearing on question of gerrymandering and there just doesn't happen to be a natural boundary to come there."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.874,2273.273,"Well, what -- in any event as long as you have a free transfer plan and one can go out anywhere he pleases what significance do these lines have anyway?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2273.273,2275.272,It has this significance Your Honor.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2279.832,2280.564,I see.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2280.564,2307.742,"Now, we were told by this Court to eliminate segregated dual system and this display on right here sets up a unitary geographic zone for every school that we have in our system, we take that student by the hands and make him go in that school physically every year and register and as far as the City of Jackson is concerned that is where that child must go to school unless their parents choose otherwise."
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.742,2314.698,"Mr. Rice, you drew the line right in the middle for the high schools, is that right, in the middle of that map."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2314.698,2316.705,Something like that.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.705,2323.632,"Well, why couldn't you use that same line for the junior high school?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2323.632,2325.132,I possibly could.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.132,2330.728,Wouldn't that -- and just on the question of energy.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2330.728,2331.416,Question of what?
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2331.416,2338.261,Energy -- wouldn't be easier to do that and all of those involved in business.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2338.261,2341.264,We have no pride of authorship in those lines Your Honor.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.29,2352.591,Would you be willing to put that line there now and say that everybody on this side goes to that one junior high school and everybody on the other side goes to one or other too?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2352.591,2356.693,As long as the Court allows us the freedom that Goss gave us.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.693,2358.749,My question didn't give you that freedom.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2358.749,2363.76,"Well, I'm not agreeable to do it because I don't think it's constitutional requirement."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2437.863,2440.72,When did you start coming along as you mentioned --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2440.72,2458.744,"The first integration in Jackson was on a voluntary basis in 1961, I grant the Court that there was more or less putting the cold water so to speak to see what the temperature was but nevertheless that it was a move of considerable magnitude in that area at that time."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.536,2497.11,"Well, I gather then that your submission is much as in the previous case as long as you have a free transfer and free choice of schools that you can't be violating the Fourteenth Amendment."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2497.11,2500.15,We don't think we are violating the Fourteenth Amendment Your Honor.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.372,2519.55,"Well, was it -- suppose with the free choice provision do you suppose in Jackson that was predictable that there would be this pattern of the school attendance."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2519.55,2526.862,I can say this to you Your Honor that we had no more idea what would come of this than any judge sitting on this panel.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.862,2545.933,"But in any event, it's a plan which permits the community attitudes to be reflected in the school attendance and you say that is precisely what it does and that does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2545.933,2548.176,"When you speak of a community attitude, I --"
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.176,2555.516,"No I mean because the city is in community, it reflects the attitudes of parents and school children."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2555.516,2583.03,"As distinguished from hostile community attitude because in our case -- we haven't got any hostile community attitudes but we do have the attitude to the -- you see that there are many Negroes in this country and in Jackson, Tennessee, we have a considerable group who have great pride in their race and in things that are all Negro and I think it's on erroneous conclusion to conclude that anything that is all Negro if so per se is bad."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.03,2596.645,We had the benefit of Goss and Goss said no official transfer plan of which racial segregation is the inevitable consequence may stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2596.645,2597.004,That's right.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.004,2601.242,I suppose that would apply to the one that's so called unrestrictive transfer plans as well as any other?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2601.242,2603.94,I think it would if it was the inevitable result.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.94,2608.251,How non-inevitable is it in Jackson.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2608.251,2623.12,"It's not inevitable in this sense Your Honor that in 1966 and ‘67, 475 Negro children took advantage of the integrated education."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.605,2647.604,Are they officially registered in the school of their district don't they?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2647.604,2648.396,They must do that.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.396,2649.026,They must do that.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2654.617,2655.458,Right.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.458,2658.957,And then there's a transfer --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2658.957,2659.643,If they choose.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.643,2662.213,If they choose without giving any reason.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2662.213,2662.619,That's right.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.619,2663.868,No necessity to give any reason.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2663.868,2665.546,That's correct.
1967.740,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2679.987,2686.23,They didn't had to deny transfer in any case because of lack of facilities.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2686.23,2691.032,"No sir, we have not."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2691.795,2712.122,Is there any -- was there any reason why that red line to the left on your -- to my left -- should outline an area of the city which is almost entirely White.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2712.122,2713.868,Capacity of school.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2713.868,2714.479,I beg your pardon.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2714.479,2721.608,"Capacity of the school, you have to get enough children in the school to use it efficiently that's all."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2721.608,2735.774,"Well, is there any reason why you couldn't have divided the city a little differently so it wouldn't find all the Negroes or mostly Negroes in one district and most of the Whites in another."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2735.774,2738.07,I assume not.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2738.07,2741.01,And why did they do that then?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2741.01,2742.461,Well as I stated it.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2742.461,2744.857,Was that just happenstance or --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2744.857,2755.731,"Well, the Negroes are all lay up in the center area of the city and almost anyway we diagram it -- we're going to have a substantial group of Negroes together."
1967.740,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2772.635,2775.696,Do you run a free bus service for school children?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2775.696,2777.144,No sir.
1967.740,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2777.144,2780.307,What sort of transportation method is there?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2780.307,2787.641,There is a city bus system and primarily they are transported either they walk to the school or their parents bring them.
1967.740,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2787.641,2794.944,And is there a reduced fare for school children on the city bus system?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2794.944,2799.255,"I tell you the truth Your Honor, I don't know."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2800.233,2807.762,"So under your arrangement, the Negroes who live over here on the right side of your map --"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2807.762,2809.36,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2809.36,2819.796,Would have to either walk or have their own automobiles or go on buses to attend the school way over on the left part of your map.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2819.796,2820.617,Are you speaking here?
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2820.617,2822.707,Yes.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2822.707,2827.297,"Well, if these over here wanted to go there, they'd have to get there somehow and --"
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2827.297,2829.186,I suppose there are no natural boundaries.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2836.558,2841.4,"No sir, you find your -- you find your planned area of our city on the outskirts."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2847.003,2847.418,I see.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2851.695,2869.577,"To point out to the Court, I looked at the Appendix for a moment and I found that Exhibits one through nine of the defendants in the court below were consolidated on to this exhibit which is Exhibit 11."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2884.775,2888.502,Are those the petitioner's exhibits?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2888.502,2890.137,They are the defendant's exhibits below.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2890.137,2892.377,"Oh, the defense below, yes."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,2892.377,2900.793,"Now, in the short term that I have left, there are one or two points that I would like to touch upon."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.92,3014.733,Is there anything in the record to indicate the fairness or otherwise the transfer system as you use it here?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3014.733,3023.735,The record itself is an appeal from the District Court order telling us to see that it is free.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3023.735,3031.938,But is there anything to indicate whether it has function equitably in the past?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3031.938,3036.092,You mean here back to the August 11th?
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3036.092,3038.163,"Well, let's put it this way."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3051.875,3057.186,"The Court has never found that we or in bad faith -- now, they did find this --"
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3057.186,3059.429,I'm not talking about bad faith.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3070.527,3088.099,"Up to the time of August 11, 1965 decision, the Court said that we were not granting every Negro child a transfer and that sets every White child to get a transfer that we were an error and they fine us a thousand dollars for that."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3090.414,3094.011,I thought they were acting discriminatorily.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3094.011,3097.648,"In the courts conclusion, I think that would have to be the conclusion, yes sir."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3115.95,3125.778,"Is there ever been one since that time asked for a transfer to the school or here on the left, the one where it's all White?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3125.778,3130.972,There are seven Negro children in there and everyone that has asked to go there has been allowed to go there.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3130.972,3131.73,Has been allowed to go.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3131.73,3134.765,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3169.187,3185.217,"But could you tell me in as brief statement as possible, what you understand they want you to do and what you say you are doing, what is the difference between them?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3185.217,3200.127,The difference between us Mr. Justice Black is that they want us to compulsorily assign White children to what has been the formerly Negro schools.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3208.91,3211.121,They want you to compel --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3211.121,3212.012,Right.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3212.012,3219.292,"The student, colored students to go into the White schools enough to bring about a better showing of integration, is that it?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3219.292,3222.375,And White children vice versa into the Negro school.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3222.525,3223.869,Then what is your position.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3223.869,3247.685,Our position is that the constitution told us to stop discrimination and then we have so stopped that it does not require a racial mixing to any of the -- they don't define what formula but that it does not actually require the state to compulsorily assign somebody in order to achieve racial mixing in any particular school.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3247.685,3256.688,How far is it from over here that you put your hand some time ago by where they are or to the school that's all White.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3259.59,3264.031,"Well, the maximum, I would say its three miles."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3264.031,3267.177,That's what they would have to walk or go on a bus.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3267.177,3271.188,"If they were assigned over there, they would have to get there somehow."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3271.188,3276.445,Are there buses that go directly from this school on the right over to the school on the left?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3276.445,3277.546,No sir.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3277.546,3281.923,--which is all Negro and the one which is White with the exception of seven.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3281.923,3282.346,No sir.
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3284.427,3285.496,How would they have to go?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3286.73,3287.672,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3302.284,3309.89,"What you'd have to do then would depend on in walking like our fathers did, the city buying in a bus."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3309.89,3318.227,"Ride the city buses to town transfer and then ride back up, it would be six to seven miles trip."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3318.227,3323.629,What is the bus fare from this school on the right to the school on the left?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3323.629,3327.033,The regular fare Your Honor is $0.25.I frankly --
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3327.033,3328.91,Each way?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3328.91,3333.465,But I do not know for certain whether there is a reduced fare on not.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3340.902,3345.888,"Mr. Rice, what's the purpose of the transfer plan?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3345.888,3359.416,"The purpose of the transfer plan Mr. Justice Marshall is simply this, that at the level at which I operate, which is at the School Board level, we have to deal in possibilities."
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3411.862,3426.22,But the transfer plan was so that individual people who had a desire to attend the school of one racial group could do so.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3426.22,3428.427,For any reason.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3428.427,3431.722,And you did realize that that was one of the reasons.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3431.722,3441.768,We did realize Your Honor that the Goss case told us that a transfer that was utterly free without racial consideration was satisfactory.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3441.768,3455.968,And you realized that this was allowing for the individuals on their own to use their racial prejudices to determine which school they would go to.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3455.968,3458.434,I don't know that I realized that at all Your Honor.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3458.434,3465.813,But didn't you realize that there were some White people living next door to that Negro high school that wouldn't go there?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3465.813,3471.885,I have no idea -- we thought there was a good chance and we wondered what we would do.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3471.885,3474.672,"Well, what do you think happened if there are none there?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3474.672,3476.34,They don't wish to go there Mr. Justice Marshall.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3476.34,3477.686,And you didn't realize that.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3477.686,3478.103,Sir?
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3478.103,3481.831,You didn't realize that that they wouldn't want to go to the Negro --
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3481.831,3483.858,I had no idea what they would do.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3483.858,3493.997,"You didn't realize that a White citizen in Jackson, Tennessee might not want to go to the Washington Douglas School did you?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3493.997,3498.45,I'm sure -- I'm reasonably sure that the White people would not want to go there -- yes sir.
1967.740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3498.45,3501.929,And you knew that when you got this plan.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3501.929,3503.693,"Well, of course I know it, yes sir."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3509.513,3515.065,"Mr. Rice, may I ask if you did not have the free transfer privilege."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3515.065,3516.016,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3516.016,3528.874,And all of the junior high school children living in a particular distance have to attend the junior high school in his or her district.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3528.874,3529.791,Yes sir.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3529.791,3536.954,What would be the racial mix in those three schools?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3536.954,3543.13,In the -- I have to guess --
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.13,3545.487,I appreciate that.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3545.487,3555.876,The district of the Jackson Junior High School or I would say would be about 25% Negro and 75% White.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3571.975,3584.078,"And I think you said earlier the thing that you apprehended if that kind of plan were adopted, is that those living in the district as of Washington Douglas in that middle district."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3584.078,3586.209,This is Merry Junior High.
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3586.209,3592.092,"Yes that those living in that district, the Whites would move out rather than have their children go to that school."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3592.092,3594.726,I don't think there is any question about it Your Honor.
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3594.726,3601.334,As I understand your position from directive and I want to see if it's right.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3634.351,3638.711,"On basis of race, yes."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3638.711,3646.874,And that's the position you take as a whole.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3651.382,3656.199,"If I understand -- understood you Your Honor, I think that that's very close."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3656.199,3657.669,What does it mean?
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3657.669,3659.694,"Well, I'm not really sure that I did understand."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3659.694,3690.769,"What I intended to ask you was if your view based on the fact, you would not make any child in the community of a certain age or his parents agree to send him to a school which they objected to sending him to that on the contrary, you take the position and you're allowed to take the position that you are not going to compel anybody to go to the school they don't want to go to."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3690.769,3693.536,"On the basis of race, yes."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3693.536,3700.837,"What basis you -- on any basis, what you're saying is that you're not going to compel him to do."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3700.837,3712.412,"Well, that's the big difference because the petitioners contend here that they should -- if necessary, they should be compelled because they are White to go to a Negro school -- formerly Negro school --"
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3712.412,3714.223,"Well, that's on that side."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3715.311,3719.989,"On our side of the picture Mr. Justice Black, it's our position."
1967.740,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3719.989,3723.959,"I'm not talking about your position, one is White and one is colored."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3735.319,3736.566,"Yes, that is right."
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3823.196,3839.509,How many -- I would suppose that that it would be relevant to inquire how many Negroes have requested transfer out of the districts to which they would be initially assigned.
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3841.912,3845.545,No sir but I can tell the Court.
1967.740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3858.468,3860.83,"Now, how about the reverse where they --"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3860.83,3877.241,"303 Negro children transferred from predominantly White schools into predominantly Negro schools of the White children transferred from predominantly Negro schools to predominantly White schools, 269."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3879.843,3884.426,"Mr. Rice, this is a fair question."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3895.062,3902.862,"Well, I really can't say because we don't have -- we didn't have that before us when we were trying to work this up."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3905.607,3922.662,"Well for example, I'm sure with your obvious familiarity with this whole problem in other places where they have all White communities are free transfer plans very common?"
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3925.918,3931.599,"Well, let me talk about what we had before segregation was knocked out."
1967.740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3942.066,3946.468,"Well, I suppose always a transfer in so called hardship cases and things like that."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,3964.916,3983.57,"Perhaps not as absolute as this case because of the terminology of the Goss case but we did have a -- you see the school is for the people and where we've got capacity and the ability to accommodate somebody without damaging the system, we've always tried to do that."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3983.57,4013.89,"Mr. Rice, is there any real difference in principle, we claim your program here and the statute of California that was recently before this Court which said that anyone could sell or lease his real estate to anyone that he wanted and could not be compelled to -- sold to anyone else regardless of price."
1967.740,1,40305,russell_rice,,4026.375,4032.348,"Mr. Justice Warren, I'm not acquainted with that case and I really would be reluctant to answer you without knowing the basis of it."
1967.740,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4032.348,4043.534,Very well.
