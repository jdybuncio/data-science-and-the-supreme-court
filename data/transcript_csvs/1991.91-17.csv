1991.91-17,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.997,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-17, Estate of Floyd Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Company."
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,55.698,59.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-17,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.763,205.089,"That is the Fourth Circuit case, Mr. Frischhertz?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,205.089,208.432,--That's the Fourth Circuit case that I attached to my Reply Brief.
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.061,312.577,Very easily.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,314.513,319.621,"The settlement is of a third party settlement, but the settlement was with Nicklos Drilling."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.449,323.104,That doesn't mean it's with them.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,323.104,346.75,"That's my argument to the Court, and I buttress that with the provisions of section 8(i) of the act which provides that an employee's termination of compensation can only be effected with a settlement that is submitted to the deputy commissioner and is approved by the deputy commissioner."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.102,369.178,Why was it a settlement of his compensation claim?
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,371.943,374.24,"That's what, that's my... I agree with the Court."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.279,393.934,"The statute says that, doesn't it?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,393.934,400.542,"The statute says that, but the statute, in the language of it, states a third person."
1991.91-17,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.635,457.94,"Well, Mr. Frischhertz, what do you make of the language in the last clause of section 933(g)(2), which says that benefits are forfeited regardless of whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefits under this chapter?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,457.94,465.766,--That goes to the interpretation of what a person entitled to comp is and what the meaning of the amendments are.
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,691.032,704.872,"But Mr. Frischhertz, didn't Congress have another reference in mind as indicated in the first clause of sub (2), which refers specifically to written approval of settlement obtained as required in (1)?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,704.872,706.761,That's correct.
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,774.077,780.231,"Well, what do we make of the fact that he's not giving the brilliant argument now and the Government has cut his feet off?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,780.231,783.901,"--Well, I don't know if I want to answer for the Government."
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.776,788.603,"I mean, is there anything left for us to defer to?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,788.603,803.611,--It's interesting... of course we have acknowledged that deference is to be given to the Director when they have an interpretation that is not inconsistent with the clear language of the statute.
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.407,891.967,"I just want to know whether there's anything left for us to defer to, regardless of what's in the mind of the hierarchy."
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,891.967,910.585,"--The only thing I suggest is there are cases that I cite in the Reply Brief that suggest that when an administrative body changes a long-standing position and makes a 180 degree reversal, that we don't give that new position the deference, but if any deference--"
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,910.585,911.601,"Well, what do we do about the old position?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,914.18,916.881,"--Well, I think you can interpret the cases I cited to say that."
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.958,1002.705,"Excuse me, but at that point the right to compensation is vested, isn't it, for those prior cases?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1002.705,1011.171,--Not when you have a statutory body overruling what was an administrative or a judicial interpretation.
1991.91-17,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.05,1039.488,O'Leary is a Benefit Review Board decision?
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1039.488,1039.894,Yes.
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1056.34,1070.084,"But isn't there perhaps an answer to your fear just in the very text of subsection (2), because subsection (2) refers to the two instances in which the employee has failed to do something, he has failed to get the approval and he has failed to give notice?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1087.749,1090.03,"Well, if that's the interpretation, yes."
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1091.295,1100.386,"Well, but I mean, isn't that the, what the text suggests should be the interpretation, and if so doesn't that counter your argument of--"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1100.386,1109.21,"--That's not the accepted interpretation, because right now the administrative law judges are granting summary decisions terminating compensation--"
1991.91-17,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.21,1110.039,--That do relate back.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1110.039,1110.57,--That do.
1991.91-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.388,1148.132,"May I just at this point... when did the change in position, this is actually not just in the briefs here, because I didn't realize they had changed their position in their Brief in Opposition or the cert stage, but when did the ALJ start deciding these cases differently?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1148.132,1154.801,"--After the Fifth Circuit en banc rendered its decision in 1991, August."
1991.91-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.347,1160.628,Just in the Fifth Circuit or all over the country?
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1160.628,1166.703,"--Oh, I think it's, I think it's probably relating only to the Fifth Circuit cases."
1991.91-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.703,1170.936,"They did that even though the Director in the Fifth Circuit was, took the contrary position?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1170.936,1171.905,They did that even though.
1991.91-17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.682,1184.399,"Well, they seized on it because they thought they had to."
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1184.399,1189.96,"I think they, I think if you allow the Fifth Circuit decision to stand, you have to."
1991.91-17,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.477,1384.304,"This is 1927, the year, you're talking about?"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1384.304,1384.617,Yes.
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.235,1564.371,"Mr. Frischhertz, it seems to me you're troubled about the retroactivity portion, but our usual law is that statutes are construed to be prospective only, not... judicial decisions are retroactive."
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1571.775,1577.664,"--Well, if the interpretation that the Fifth Circuit has given it is to be."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.664,1577.976,That's right.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1594.077,1603.371,"I, my interpretation is that when you have a person receiving compensation under an order under section (1) you need written permission."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.834,1626.628,But the notice covers situations other than... the settlement covered by paragraph 1 is only a settlement for less than what he's entitled to from the employer.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1638.2,1642.136,"But, but the notice clause says any settlement, so how can it be just for more than?"
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.136,1649.213,"Well, it... yeah, I admit it should have said any other settlement--"
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1649.213,1650.758,But I think--
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.758,1651.961,--but it still says or.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1655.287,1660.412,"--The reading, converting to an and would mean that you need notice and written permission."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.535,1661.988,That's what you're saying.
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1661.988,1662.535,"--No, no."
1991.91-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.832,1663.691,You--
1991.91-17,0,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,1663.691,1671.328,You only need notice when you are not a person entitled to compensation but an employee.
1991.91-17,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.107,1718.027,"--Very well, Mr. Frischhertz."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1719.684,1730.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.709,1860.314,"Let me just ask to be sure I get the facts in my... at the time of your settlement negotiations where you killed the two birds with one stone in effect, did you, you were then not paying compensation to the petitioner?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1860.314,1865.952,"Literally we were not paying... or, I'm sorry, is the question were we paying compensation benefits at that time?"
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.952,1866.575,Yes.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1866.575,1867.185,We were not.
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.185,1867.653,You were not.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1875.838,1881.616,It was our position at that time that he was a person entitled to compensation.
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1881.616,1882.804,Then why weren't you paying it?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1882.804,1890.004,Because we had paid him temporary total disability up until the time that he had been medically discharged and released to return to work.
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.175,1891.66,What was that?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1894.925,1901.844,--The dispute that we were settling... does Your Honor mean the third-party claim?
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.844,1903.327,"Well, no, the two claims."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1909.668,1911.244,The claimant was asserting that he was--
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.244,1914.165,That what he has lost in the proceedings now is this additional compensation.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1916.29,1916.883,"--No, sir."
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.582,1930.082,Correct.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1930.082,1940.829,"We resisted it, frankly, primarily because we wanted to make the third party settlement over here in the context of the lawsuit he brought against Transco and close this whole thing out without having to deal with the Department of Labor."
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.829,1962.086,"But it seems to me that you had an inconsistence in your position then, that you were treating him as a person not entitled to compensation for purposes of your negotiations with him, but once you made your settlement with the, with Transco he suddenly developed into a person entitled to compensation and therefore lost his benefit... did I miss something?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1962.086,1968.771,"No, he was always a person entitled to compensation from the time he sustained his injury, his disability causing injury."
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.316,1973.737,--I'm not sure that's the answer you gave me a moment ago.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1973.737,1975.3,Well--
1991.91-17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.3,1988.31,"Well, he might have been for a while a person entitled to compensation, but when you were carrying on these negotiations it was your claim that he was no longer entitled to any, he was no longer a person entitled to compensation."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,1988.31,1997.76,"--Well, I think the correct way to state our position was that it was our view that he was a person entitled to compensation who had received all the compensation he was entitled to."
1991.91-17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.76,2000.618,And therefore was no longer a person entitled to compensation.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2000.618,2001.9,"Well, I can accept that--"
1991.91-17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.9,2002.337,Is that right or not?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2002.337,2003.538,--Yes.
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.065,2014.222,"Yes, but not for the reason given by the court below."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2014.222,2017.86,"Well, for purposes of the--"
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.86,2021.734,What you're saying is under those facts you'd win no matter how we construed the statute.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2021.734,2022.375,--That's correct.
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.982,2038.946,"Mr. Lewis, why did Congress use the word employee in 933(g) when it used the phrase person entitled to compensation every place else?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2038.946,2039.759,--I have no idea.
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.759,2041.569,Do they mean the same thing?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2043.211,2051.425,"Well, I think that the reason is that the person entitled to compensation is not always the employee."
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.078,2063.514,"Well, except it has a parenthesis there, or the person's representatives."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2067.029,2071.822,"That's probably correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2195.961,2211.266,"--Well, Mr. Lewis, what is your answer to the concern expressed by the petitioner about any so-called retroactive effect of the Fifth Circuit's interpretation here?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2227.338,2228.729,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.729,2229.416,Yes.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2229.416,2242.13,"I think as I read the Fifth Circuit's decision, opinion, there are no exceptions to 33(g)'s provision that where a third-party settlement is made for less than the amount of compensation entitlement--"
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2242.13,2262.153,"And yet at the time that those actions were resolved the Federal, the Department was taking a different view, was taking the petitioner's view and were allowing these additional benefits."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2262.153,2263.542,--And I think the Department was wrong.
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2263.542,2265.479,"Well, but there we are."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2268.385,2270.15,I don't personally know that.
1991.91-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.382,2328.391,"If we accepted your interpretation and benefits were stripped from claimants who relied on the prior agency interpretation, could Congress then go back and amend the statute and restore those benefits?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2328.391,2331.358,I suppose the Congress could do that.
1991.91-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.445,2401.237,"Well, we could also reach the same result by refusing to extend it before the enactment of the revised 933(g) which included the subsection (2) for the first time, and that was 1984."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2407.545,2418.183,"That's true, but as far as my own interpretation of it, I don't see that 33(g) has any different import now than it did--"
1991.91-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.183,2420.322,Don't you think (2) makes it clearer than it was without (2)?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2420.322,2436.144,"--(2) definitely makes it clearer, but I think the purpose of adding (2) was to remove any ambiguity as to determining how and in what manner the express consent of the employer is to be solicited and given."
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.812,2451.668,May I just ask this one question?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2458.291,2460.399,"They both require what, Your Honor?"
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.399,2461.462,Written approval.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2463.539,2463.82,No.
1991.91-17,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.551,2476.863,"--Oh, I understood you to say because it covered the larger settlement as well."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2476.863,2479.346,--Larger settlement or judgment.
1991.91-17,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.393,2490.918,Why does the statute (g)(2) take away an employee's compensation if he has received a settlement for an amount greater than the amount of benefits?
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2490.918,2496.776,"--Well, I don't think it takes it away in any retrospective sense that you could go back and get back from him what you've already paid to him."
1991.91-17,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2506.772,2526.093,"But the point of doing it was suggested in a footnote in the SG's brief that it might refer to future medicals and it might refer it, even though the settlement was on its face more than the amount of the benefits, the net would be less, so it would apply to that."
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2529.809,2539.212,"Well, there is a residual liability for medical benefits even in the event of third-party settlements that are for more than the amount of compensation entitlement."
1991.91-17,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2540.071,2544.522,"I mean, you are then adopting the suggesting in the Solicitor General's brief?"
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2544.522,2545.287,--I think that's correct.
1991.91-17,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.287,2545.662,Yes.
1991.91-17,1,27503,h_lee_lewis_jr,,2545.662,2548.724,Thank you very much.
1991.91-17,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.724,2550.441,"Thank you, Mr. Lewis."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2551.691,2556.33,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.593,2563.889,May I interrupt just to get one thing clear on the record?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2565.686,2571.012,--The Federal respondent is the Director of Office of Worker Compensation Programs.
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.012,2581.008,"And is it correct, I may not have read it, that your position as you set forth in your Brief on the Merits, you really didn't reveal that in your Brief in Opposition or your comment in the response stage."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2581.008,2583.006,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.034,2596.438,Is one that you really reached between the time cert was granted and the main brief--
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2596.438,2596.953,--That's correct.
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.0,2604.014,Really.
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2604.014,2609.168,"--Well, the Director is supporting this position that we're presenting today."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.168,2609.512,Yes.
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2609.512,2611.057,He is within the Department of Labor text.
1991.91-17,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2611.057,2616.399,"Well, why has the Director's opinion changed in this matter?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2616.399,2627.427,"Justice O'Connor, the submission that we're making here today is that the claim in clear text of section 33 determines the outcome of the case."
1991.91-17,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2627.427,2635.346,"Well, the Director never read the text before, in the past, in arguing so ably in the lower courts for the other view?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2635.346,2640.56,"Of course the Director read the text, consulted the text."
1991.91-17,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2652.197,2665.927,"Well, are you going to address the potentially devastating effect on thousands of people who reached settlements at a time when the Government was arguing for their position?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2665.927,2667.754,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-17,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2677.438,2679.748,"Mr. Dreeben, would you speak up a little bit?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2680.701,2692.307,"To the extent that a case has gone to judgment and has not been appealed by an employer to a court, that case will not be affected by the Court's ruling here today."
1991.91-17,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.102,2696.071,Even with respect to future medicals?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2696.071,2699.444,"--Yes, I think even with respect to future medicals."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.856,2724.949,"Yes, but what about cases where compensation was being paid independently of a judgment?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2724.949,2731.602,"Cases that, in which compensation was being paid voluntarily are governed by the statute."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.789,2733.836,There may be a lot of those.
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2733.836,2736.96,"--I think that there are going to be a lot of those, that's correct."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.96,2741.787,"And even on the ones where there's a judgment your position is different, differs from that of the respondent I think."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2741.787,2750.923,"I don't know what the respondent's position is on cases that have gone to judgment, but our position is that those cases are governed by res judicata."
1991.91-17,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.771,2859.567,"Just to finish that off, you wouldn't make a distinction between pre and post-1984?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2866.127,2885.494,"--I think it's a closer question, Justice Scalia, as to what the statute clearly meant prior to the 1984 amendments, and we would have no disagreement if this Court concluded that pre-1984 the Director's position was permissible, but in light of the 1984 amendments it was not permissible."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.708,2902.018,"Well then you're saying the enactment of (g)(2) changed the meaning of what was previously (g) and then now (g)(1), or at least arguably did so."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2902.018,2907.532,"--I think that is an arguable reading of what Congress did, because the--"
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.532,2912.139,"So the language of (g) wasn't really all that clear, but it became clearer after (g)(2) was added."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2912.139,2932.226,"--Well, for a number of reasons I think in fact the coverage of the term person entitled to compensation was pretty clearly more broad than the position that the Director had taken prior to 1984, but I would not disagree with a reading of the statute that said before 1984 there may be some room for ambiguity."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.48,3041.447,Doesn't your opponent say that is a cross reference to (b) which in turn is just someone receiving compensation--
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3041.447,3050.475,"--Actually the cross reference to (b) doesn't prove that much, because what (b) does is function as a statute of limitations provision in effect."
1991.91-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.107,3072.497,The people referred to in (b) are all people receiving compensation.
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3072.497,3080.166,"By definition, the people who reach the outer limit of their right to sue are in that category."
1991.91-17,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3126.726,3136.55,"Mr. Dreeben, can you explain why (g)(2) uses the word employee but elsewhere in the statute it's personal, person entitled to compensation?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3138.518,3142.234,"I think it's less than precise drafting going on there, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-17,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3178.203,3195.589,"Mr. Dreeben, is it, number one, possible or does it happen with any frequency that there are more than one third person, there will be maybe a principal third person who has a potential for liability but some very collateral third persons that might make small settlements?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3196.712,3216.533,"It happens most often, Justice Kennedy, in the occupational disease context where in fact an employee might work for several different employers and be exposed to asbestos or coal dust over a number of years and therefore have a number of potential defendants all of whom might be liable for causing part of the injury."
1991.91-17,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3216.533,3227.684,"And so settlement with any one of those third persons would, under your view, preclude, the unauthorized settlement would preclude obtaining benefits from any employer?"
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3227.684,3237.617,"If in fact the employee is entitled to compensation at the time he makes the settlement, which presupposes that the employee is in fact disabled."
1991.91-17,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3250.503,3252.814,Because the person is not entitled to compensation?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3252.814,3253.361,That's correct.
1991.91-17,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.73,3273.806,So if you collect from the third party soon enough you can collect from both him and the employer?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3273.806,3276.695,"Well, the employer would be able to get a credit."
1991.91-17,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.96,3281.521,Why does it presuppose that?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3282.396,3285.864,"Well, the act--"
1991.91-17,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.864,3300.983,"--If you're still using it, (f) covers the person entitled to compensation, and if you use your theory that you're not a person entitled to compensation until the disability shows up, if he gets the money before the disability shows up it seems to me he could keep that and get it from the employer as well."
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3300.983,3315.086,"--Well, he eventually becomes a person entitled to compensation at the time that he seeks Longshore Act benefits, and (f) is not written so as to exempt a person who is actually entitled to compensation from the credit rules of this section."
1991.91-17,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3315.086,3321.646,So then person entitled to compensation in some instances is not equivalent to employee?
1991.91-17,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3321.646,3323.145,That's correct.
1991.91-17,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3429.009,3430.711,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1991.91-17,3,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,3433.382,3445.986,"Your Honor, the Court in Palace in 1983 interpreted section (b), person entitled to comp, to mean someone receiving comp under an order."
1991.91-17,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.443,3514.006,"Thank you, Mr. Frischhertz."
1991.91-17,3,34430,lloyd_n_frischhertz,,3514.006,3514.163,Thank you.
1991.91-17,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.163,3516.346,The case is submitted.
