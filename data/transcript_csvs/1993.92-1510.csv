1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.378,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1510, Michael Cavanaugh v. Gary Lee Roller."
1993.92-1510,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,20.365,31.884,"Mr. Lundberg, before you start, when was the South Carolina statute passed, the statute that raises this issue?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,31.884,43.763,"The statute was passed in June of this year, but we didn't know about it, my colleagues and I, nor the corrections community, nobody was aware of it until Friday of this past week."
1993.92-1510,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,43.763,52.739,"Well, you come in here with a four and a half month old statute and present it to us the eve of argument."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,56.762,73.882,"No, Your Honor, but in South Carolina this past legislative season we had a massive restructuring of state government and we had a large number of laws... I have a copy on my desk that was the earliest draft I could get of this classification bill, and on the draft that I have it doesn't have this provision in it."
1993.92-1510,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,102.813,111.558,Other states I think have daily legislative service that enable lawyers to keep up with what is going on in the legislature.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,116.771,119.362,"Yes, Your Honor, it was very awkward for me too."
1993.92-1510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.496,147.119,"Now that you're here, is the 1983 aspect of this suit at least still alive?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,147.119,154.645,"Your Honor, it's our position that until January 1 of 1994 all the issues are alive in this case."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.205,206.501,"I wonder how much of a practical help... that is ordinarily a case that is argued in the November arguments probably would not be decided until after January 1 here, so that we're talking not just about today, but we have to talk too about the possibility of our Court not having finished its work on the case until after the first of January."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,206.501,209.152,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.321,237.783,"And that's our test, isn't it?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,246.836,271.473,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, and in addition, since there has been no publicity, no one in the corrections field, no one in the probation field, no one in the general public, as strange as it may seem, has had an opportunity to be aware of this particular piece of legislation, and now that the advance sheets are out it may be that the general assembly will find some concern about the effect of this legislation and it may be that they will be altering the legislation in the near future."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.473,279.198,"May I ask, just to have a better understanding, you mentioned the conference committee apparently amended the legislation at the last minute."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,288.474,303.244,"No, Your Honor, the amendment that I referred to was in the section that made it active, that's section 266 that says that the retroactive effect of 16-1-60(b), that that section will be retroactive."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.231,340.58,"Is it possible in your view that the purpose of doing that was to take care of this very litigation because we had granted cert in the case, or at least the Fourth Circuit had decided the issue?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,340.58,350.327,"I can't answer what's in the mind of legislature, but I doubt very seriously that it was in their mind or that they were even aware of it."
1993.92-1510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,350.327,354.627,I take it that in fact he has not had a hearing this year?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,354.627,356.54,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.558,419.433,"Would there be any limit of time to the correctness of your statement if they decided, for example, there would be a hearing only every 20 years?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,420.424,437.024,"Under the proposition that I am saying, I think that it would not make any difference because if the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply, then it would not make any difference in terms of an ex post facto analysis of whether or not there was a hearing in 1 year or 20 years."
1993.92-1510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.534,499.588,"Mr. Lundberg, suppose the statute, suppose you had a statute that said anyone convicted of a crime will be eligible for parole after 1 year, and then the statute is amended to say that person will be eligible for parole only after 10 years."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,505.682,522.191,"Well, Your Honor, the position that I am taking is that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to the scheduling between parole consideration hearings, and the logical extension of that position is that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to parole eligibility period."
1993.92-1510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.191,522.892,Period.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,522.892,524.043,Period.
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.646,565.89,Why doesn't this make the punishment more burdensome when one is eligible for parole after a period of time and later on he's not eligible.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,567.192,573.817,"--No, the punishment that is prescribed in the statute is for a fixed number, is for whatever is allowed in the statute."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.728,625.672,"Would you go so far as to say that if a state had, say a 30-year sentence for a particular crime for everybody and at the end of 1/3 of the sentence the person was eligible for parole and routinely parole was granted, they then abolish parole entirely so that everybody has to start serving their full 30-year sentences, what would you say in that case?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,625.672,634.988,"Your Honor, I would say that the sentence, if it were 30 years, remains 30 years, and the fact that the situs of the service of the sentence might change doesn't change the sentence."
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.425,667.229,"Mr. Lundberg, do I understand correctly that the South Carolina Supreme Court now agrees with the Fourth Circuit and has rejected your argument on the merits?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,667.229,668.782,You do understand correctly.
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.782,676.646,"And was the legislation, the recent legislative change in South Carolina, responsive to the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,676.646,678.209,"No, it was not."
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.491,705.186,South Carolina was following what they took to be the meaning of the U.S. Constitution based on what the Fourth Circuit said.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,705.186,708.107,"That's my interpretation of the case, Your Honor, yes."
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.888,712.14,But the legislative change in fact came first?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,712.14,713.592,That's correct.
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,721.636,725.649,The South Carolina Supreme Court was not aware of the legislative change as far as you know?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,725.649,727.999,"To the best of my knowledge that is exactly correct, they were not aware."
1993.92-1510,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,727.999,734.355,"Mr. Lundberg, do you have any comment about Akins against Snow in the Eleventh Circuit?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,734.355,736.235,Yes.
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,905.045,907.306,How about Weaver against Graham?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,907.306,913.17,"Weaver against Graham was a, although they used the term gain time, it was a good time credit scheme."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.363,979.283,"Are you saying in effect that while you're on parole in South Carolina you're still, you're serving your sentence still?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,979.283,982.164,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, you continue to serve your sentence."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.783,1000.317,"Well, as a practical matter it's certainly a benefit because you're able to walk around and so forth rather than be confined."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1000.317,1014.715,"I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but every change, every procedural change that takes place, assuming that there was a violation, the Ex Post Facto Clause was implicated, doesn't necessarily mean that it's addressable or actionable."
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1042.724,1061.057,"Staying with your ex post facto, with the merits point, do I grasp your position on mootness correctly that if you were here after January 1 there would be no argument that you could make that this case is not, that the question on the merits is not moot?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1061.057,1062.729,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.671,1081.32,"In a practical sense, when would he be entitled to his next hearing had the statute been in effect all along, the 1-year provision been in effect?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1081.32,1085.814,"He became eligible for parole, Your Honor... and I don't know, that's another point."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.832,1118.097,So under a 1-year cycle sometime in 1993 he would be receiving his next hearing?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1118.097,1123.791,Assuming that administratively they have enough spaces to get him heard.
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.791,1128.466,"Assume we didn't decide the case for 6 months for some reason, we got slow about our work or something."
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1136.83,1141.164,"Yes, I think we have to give him his hearing."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.936,1147.359,It has to be within 1993.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1147.359,1154.305,"--To do our best to comply with the court's order, that's correct, Your Honor, and administratively we're in the process of trying to accomplish that."
1993.92-1510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.575,1177.592,And I take it so far as these practicalities are concerned the same would be true if we came down with a decision against you tomorrow morning?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1177.592,1180.202,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
1993.92-1510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.202,1183.125,You wouldn't move it up just for us?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1183.125,1185.095,"Well, I think we would, Your Honor."
1993.92-1510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1194.742,1197.073,And not for the South Carolina Supreme Court?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1197.073,1205.528,"--Well, we have done our best to comply with the order, but the way, unless we have more resources we just physically don't have the time."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.648,1249.068,"Mr. Lundberg, do you have any opinion as to whether if we were to decide this case is not moot and were to reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and say that is not the law under the Federal Constitution, would the South Carolina Supreme Court then follow our view, do you think?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1249.068,1250.108,"--Well, I think so."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.522,1256.313,That's what I mean.
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1256.313,1264.717,"--on Federal grounds, and so I think the decision by this Court reversing that would necessarily, we would ask them to review it if they didn't automatically on their own review it."
1993.92-1510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.717,1270.851,Does South Carolina have a parallel provision in its state constitution prohibiting ex post facto laws?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1270.851,1271.462,It does.
1993.92-1510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1271.462,1281.029,In the earlier litigation did the litigants argue both issues and then the South Carolina court just chose to rest it on the Federal grounds?
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1281.029,1288.325,The applicant raised both constitutions in his original pleading in the Roller case.
1993.92-1510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1377.173,1387.649,"If extraordinary circumstances come to the attention of the parole board can they give a hearing under the old rule sooner than 1 year, or sooner than 2 years?"
1993.92-1510,0,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,1387.649,1393.473,"No, Your Honor, they are fixed into 1-year or 2-year intervals following a rejection."
1993.92-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.412,1421.313,"Very well, Mr. Lundberg."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1422.935,1429.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1589.026,1608.91,"That may be so when we're dealing just with an executive decision to turn something on or off, but now that there's a legislative change by the South Carolina legislature do you have any precedent that says when the legislature change that exception to mootness applies, that is for voluntary cessation?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1608.91,1611.822,"Justice Ginsburg, maybe I'm not being clear."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.853,1687.704,"Why couldn't the South Carolina Supreme Court say although the Fourth Circuit's judgment in Roller has been vacated because of mootness, we found it persuasive before and we still find it persuasive."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1689.387,1693.569,"They very possibly could, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is no guarantee they would."
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.097,1721.907,"But the South Carolina Supreme Court was not bound by what the Fourth Circuit said, so if it followed it it was only because it was persuaded by the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit, and that same reasoning would stand even if the Fourth Circuit decision is vacated."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1728.533,1730.102,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree."
1993.92-1510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1769.619,1775.122,"Mr. Fairey, you don't cite the case of Akins against Snow."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1785.811,1790.192,Akins v. Snow I think is along the same principle as the ex post facto in this case.
1993.92-1510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1802.041,1808.554,An argument could be made that is precisely the same as this case except 7 years against 1.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1808.554,1809.315,Exactly.
1993.92-1510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1815.269,1817.039,"That's rather a slippery slope, isn't it?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1817.039,1820.452,If you're going to take that analysis I think it is.
1993.92-1510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1861.722,1865.245,"Well, I recognize the issue, but I am not sure you have distinguished the case."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1866.076,1869.559,"Well, Justice Blackmun, I wouldn't try to distinguish Akins v. Snow."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.16,1913.659,"Mr. Fairey, if you prevail here I suppose the next case will be that some change adverse to the prisoner in a case of administrative segregation within the prison violates the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1915.641,1917.844,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it can."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.844,1918.481,How?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1918.481,1924.506,Depending upon whether that has an effect upon the length of sentence the individual is subject to incarceration.
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.506,1931.511,"Well, your opponent says that parole has no effect on the length of sentence, that the sentence technically remains the same."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1944.709,1949.583,"That issue I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, has been considered by this Court and rejected."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.583,1951.054,In what case?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1951.054,1953.635,"In a series of cases, I believe."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.878,1961.41,I think that was based on the entitlement argument--
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1961.41,1962.169,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.169,1964.162,--not on the Ex Post Facto Clause.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1964.162,1970.089,"Yes, Your Honor, but I don't see where someone is serving their sentence as having an effect upon the punishment imposed."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.582,1990.94,"So you say the difference between serving your sentence in prison and parole is a substantial difference, whereas the difference between serving part of your sentence in administrative segregation and the general prison population is not a substantial difference?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,1990.94,1998.417,"I would much prefer to be in the general population, but... yes, there is a quantitative difference in those two things."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.88,2012.544,"Well, you have to report to your parole officer, you probably can't, you can't commit any crime, you can't do lots of things when you're on parole that a free citizen could."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2012.544,2018.809,"I agree, but you have freedom, much greater freedom than you would while incarcerated."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.138,2034.701,"Mr. Fairey, you agree that there is no entitlement to the parole."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2034.701,2035.863,I agree.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.863,2036.784,It is purely discretionary.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2042.868,2045.909,I agree there is no right to release on parole.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.909,2046.548,Right.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2079.78,2085.034,I think you are getting dangerously close to my dividing point.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.811,2095.411,What is your answer if it's written down?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2103.539,2106.291,They I think you do get back into your analogy--
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.291,2107.22,That's bad?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2107.22,2108.051,--Not necessarily.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.051,2108.973,It's not bad?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2108.973,2110.171,It depends upon--
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.171,2112.704,Why is that any different from what you bring before us?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2112.704,2121.38,"--Because what I bring before you is a situation where the state, not the discretionary agency, but the state has imposed regulations upon the discretionary agency."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.422,2130.806,"Oh, I see, so all that the state had to do would be to leave it up to the parole board how frequently they wanted their hearings--"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2130.806,2131.437,"--Oh, yes."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.437,2139.044,"--And if they used to have them every 1 year by regulation but they decide that in the future they're going to have them every 2 years, that's okay?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2139.044,2148.569,"Justice Scalia, if they had no rule and they left it completely to the discretion of the parole board, then there would be no right to complain because there would be no expectation and there would be no increase."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.569,2153.703,"But the parole board has adopted a rule, and you say changing the parole board's own rule would not count for ex post facto purposes?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2153.703,2155.964,If that rule has the force of law it would.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.964,2156.615,Well of course.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2157.744,2158.746,Then I think it would.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.746,2159.957,It binds the parole board.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2172.635,2175.857,"In my opinion, yes, if that has the rule of law."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.857,2176.548,"Wait, now answer my question."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2200.794,2205.766,"Depending upon the... I hate to be evasive to your question, and I'm not trying to be."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.156,2208.308,You're succeeding here.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2208.308,2209.62,--I appreciate that.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.341,2228.221,But they do.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2236.156,2238.238,"--Respectfully, no, I don't think I have."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.238,2238.838,I thought you did.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2253.698,2254.399,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.799,2262.294,"So it doesn't matter whether the state does it by legislation or by agency rule, so long as it has the force--"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2262.294,2263.806,Force of law.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.806,2264.487,"--Force of law, yes."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2264.487,2265.306,Yes.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.306,2266.157,Okay.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2279.107,2283.17,"Discretionary guidelines, that's a dichotomy."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.909,2286.67,Call them regulations then.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2289.782,2296.978,"Then you are getting into a Parole Board v. Allen situation, and a Greenholtz situation if you have mandatory language in your guidelines."
1993.92-1510,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.023,2352.334,"Suppose that there is a written rule that you get your parole hearing once every year, but that also in the rule it is stated that the parole board may, because of its own work load and personnel problems, in its discretion change this to 2 years."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2356.618,2362.653,"Not if that was in the statute at the time of the sentencing, or, excuse me, at the time of the commission of the crime."
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.609,2440.774,"If it enhances punishment then why don't you lose on your threshold argument, that is that this is the improper form in which to cast this action, that it has to be habeas because you are talking about increased punishment, not a mere procedural matter, and therefore you should bring it under habeas?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2440.774,2446.387,"Because, Justice Ginsburg, while we wish release, we cannot insist upon it."
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2497.98,2500.592,You are seeking the opportunity to be released.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2500.592,2501.563,"--Yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.626,2513.08,"But you have no expectation, no legal expectation with regard to the outcome of that hearing."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2513.08,2513.641,Yes.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.637,2541.651,But the guidelines are mandatory and appealable.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2543.301,2544.052,--I'm sorry--
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.052,2551.817,"You have no cause of action if parole is denied even though you are the most desirable, eligible candidate for parole in the world."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2554.068,2554.598,--No.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.598,2556.391,"--you know, if anybody deserved parole, I did?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2559.911,2560.572,I misspoke.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.572,2565.417,So how have your expectations been changed by changing your hearing from 1 year to 2 year?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2574.362,2577.702,You have an expectation of consideration.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.058,2612.767,"I know, and we talk as though there is some legal expectation there, but there is none or else you'd be able to bring a lawsuit to get out if you were a good parole candidate, and you can't."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2622.782,2637.662,"If you have no complaint under the ex post facto law, then you have no complaint with the state doing away with parole after someone is sentenced, which to me seems if it's not in violation of ex post facto, I don't know what the framers meant when they passed ex post facto."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.7,2652.363,"Now, you have to speak of legal expectation."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2680.637,2693.255,"You did the crime and you got 30 years with a right under our law to parole consideration at the end of 10, because it says, our law says you shall be reviewed for parole."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.852,2714.259,I don't see how a right that does not exist can be turned into a right by saying that you'll get a hearing on it every 2 years.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2714.259,2717.18,I don't agree that it's not a right that doesn't exist.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.307,2776.432,"The people you say could not put in a new, people cannot get fed up with parole and put in a new legislature that abolishes parole and say no more parole?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2776.432,2777.854,Certainly they could--
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.854,2778.522,They can't do that.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2779.534,2780.375,--for the people sentenced from that point forward.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.375,2782.268,"--But not for people who are in jail already, right?"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2782.268,2785.478,"No, because they were sentenced under a system that had that as a release mechanism."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.478,2794.394,"Although the people can get fed up with a governor who, I suppose, who commutes all death sentences--"
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2794.394,2795.225,And vote him out.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.225,2797.586,--and vote him out and put in a new governor.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2797.586,2798.157,Yes.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.157,2805.243,But they can't do the same... and that wouldn't violate the ex post facto laws because even though you committed your murder before the new governor got in.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2807.664,2810.316,In my view the trick is to be consistent with the Constitution.
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.144,2831.119,"But, you see, the governor is saying I know that I don't have to commute death sentences, it's discretionary, but I am choosing to do it."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2837.344,2837.975,"--No, it does not."
1993.92-1510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.975,2845.559,"But you have a legislature who says we have this parole, we don't have to give it to you but we'll give it to you, and it's discretionary, you have no right to sue for it."
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2854.224,2859.937,"Because one is the failure to exercise discretion, the other is removal of the discretion entirely, and there is a difference in those two things."
1993.92-1510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.685,2901.406,May I just be sure of one thing?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2908.142,2909.091,"Justice Stevens, I do."
1993.92-1510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.091,2909.902,I thought you did.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2909.902,2912.955,But I wish for this Court to fashion a different remedy than the normal remedy.
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2912.955,2920.55,And your best authority for saying that the Munsingwear vacation should not follow in this case is what?
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2920.55,2921.751,Is Munsingwear.
1993.92-1510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2921.751,2923.033,Munsingwear itself.
1993.92-1510,1,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2923.033,2931.328,"It says, I believe, for the rule, they talk about why they have the rule."
1993.92-1510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.744,2960.076,"Thank you, Mr. Fairey."
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,2962.369,2963.581,Thank you.
1993.92-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.141,3025.852,It changes one thing.
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3030.697,3033.609,"--Yes, insofar as that they--"
1993.92-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.609,3036.711,There is a right to a hearing on whether you get out on parole or not.
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3036.711,3038.872,"--To be considered, that is absolutely correct."
1993.92-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.776,3047.978,"It's like you've got a right to file a lawsuit you aren't necessarily going to win, but you have a right to file it."
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3047.978,3048.608,Right.
1993.92-1510,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.531,3064.019,Your position on the Munsingwear vacation is that it ought to be vacated even though the state was the party that changed it?
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3064.019,3065.922,Yes.
1993.92-1510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.186,3104.857,Why is that?
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3107.389,3116.215,"Well, the state supreme court decision was predicated exclusively on a Federal basis, and it's our position that if this Court resolves that issue that--"
1993.92-1510,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3116.215,3122.669,Are you saying that the South Carolina Supreme Court goes in lock step with the Fourth Circuit on questions of Federal constitutional law?
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3122.669,3126.072,--I don't know how they do in all cases.
1993.92-1510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.664,3174.652,"Well, it's not a matter of being an independent state ground, but it's a matter of being independent reasoning by the judges of the state court, and they came to that conclusion as to what the Federal law means, which they are entitled to."
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3174.652,3181.928,"Which they are entitled to, but it's your prerogative to tell, to actually decide what the Federal law does mean and whether or not that decision was correct."
1993.92-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.928,3196.866,"But if we simply decide the case is moot and are trying to decide on one procedural disposition of the case or another, certainly we will not have decided the merits in such a way as to overturn the decision of the Fourth Circuit on the merits."
1993.92-1510,2,19458,carl_n_lundberg,,3196.866,3211.845,"No, but if it's vacated then the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court will no longer have any position from the Fourth Circuit to rely upon, and if they're going to continue along that same type of an analysis they'll have to independently reach it."
1993.92-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3216.529,3218.42,"Thank you, Mr. Lundberg."
