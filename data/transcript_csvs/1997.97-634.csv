1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.347,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-634, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, Ronald Yeskey."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,10.999,14.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,40.107,41.008,"Well, Mr.--"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,46.752,74.801,"Your Honor, we did make constitutional arguments in that we have always argued in this case as a matter of statutory construction, federalism issues, and the issue of the clear statement rule, and as a matter of statutory construction we believe that the Court is to be guided by possible serious and grave constitutional questions which could arise from an interpretation of the Americans With Disabilities Act as applying to prisoners."
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.801,86.699,"Did you make that argument below, that the statute should be construed a particular way because to construe it another way would get into constitutional difficulties?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,86.699,88.75,"We did not, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.612,121.652,"Mr. Tufano, the language of the statute says that public entity means any State or local government, any department, agency, district or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,124.183,125.364,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.364,135.812,"Now, what about the application of the ADA... disabilities act... to employees of prisons?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,137.422,138.043,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.043,140.955,How about to visitors at prisons?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,140.955,143.507,"We would take the position that it does apply to visitors, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.507,150.691,"Well then, what, in the language that I read, gets you off the hook for prisoners?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,150.691,168.083,"We don't dispute the fact that the Department of Corrections is a public entity within the meaning of the ADA and in title II, but there is a difference between the Department of Corrections being considered a public entity and whether a prison is a public entity or a program, activity, or service."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.655,180.151,"Well, a prison might not itself be a program, but it might have within the prison context a program or activity."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,191.941,209.121,"--We believe, Your Honor, that program, activity, and service have different meanings in the context of a prison, that it is not the... it was not the intent of Congress to cover something like prisoners, that prisoners are not part of the public, and that--"
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.121,223.841,"I can understand an argument that in complying with the statute and the regulations, that the prison only has to make reasonable modifications based on the circumstances."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,233.217,274.663,"--It would affect it, Your Honor, but again, you have to look at the fact that Congress' findings in enacting the ADA talked about employment, housing, voting, medical services, and it talked about access to public services, and it talked about people having... being able to live independently, and they talked about living in a free society, and the fact that they based their findings in large part on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Report of 1983, which they lifted the conclusions almost verbatim, except for one, on involuntary sterilization, and they chose a couple of more which were not in the conclusions--"
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.663,277.156,"Mr. Tufano, which Civil Rights Act did you say?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,277.156,280.938,"--The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Report of 1983, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.938,308.248,"And that is of the same genre, I believe, as title VI, which, as you know, covers race discrimination, and I think the language is almost identical, so would you say, then, on your reasoning about prisoners, that title VI would not apply either to prisoners?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,308.248,309.279,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.352,327.05,Who is they?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,331.874,339.609,"--It was a report of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and it was, I believe, introduced into both committees of Congress, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.609,341.96,And you want to attribute that to the whole Congress?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,341.96,368.529,"Well, Justice O'Connor's question about public entity, and whether a prison is a program, statutory construction, as this Court has held, is a holistic endeavor, and you look not only at individual sentences, but you also look at the whole purpose of the law, and the purpose of the ADA was to provide for the assimilation in free society of American citizens in employment--"
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.529,388.633,"Well, what about the background of the Rehabilitation Act, which has been on the books since the seventies, and as I understand it, the ADA is modeled precisely on that, and there is some 20 years of Department of Justice regulations saying that prisons are covered."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,388.633,391.675,"--In... that's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.173,482.319,What does appear in the four corners of the document that enables you to exclude prisons?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,497.469,511.858,"--You start with the findings, Your Honor, by Congress, in the findings section of the ADA, where they talk about the different areas where they have found problems with discrimination and the... they don't talk about the criminal--"
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.858,520.645,"So any area that is not mentioned in the finding is not covered by the text of the act, even though the words otherwise would cover it."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,523.157,525.079,"--Well, that's part of the principle I'd want you to apply."
1997.97-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.807,535.167,May I go back to the findings for a minute?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,545.335,558.531,"Yes, I am, Your Honor, because if you look below that they talk about discrimination in such areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, and recreation."
1997.97-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.531,560.053,Such areas as.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,561.553,565.697,"Institutionalization is there, but again--"
1997.97-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.697,566.638,And this is an institution.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,566.638,568.799,"--It's a correctional institution, but--"
1997.97-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.799,569.059,Yes.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,569.059,585.439,"--we believe that the meaning of institutionalization, which again these areas were lifted, that that sentence in 12101(a)(3) is almost verbatim language from the U.S. Commission Report, where institutionalization is not discussed in the criminal justice context."
1997.97-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.439,588.612,"Well, but just staying within the four corners of the document is what we started to do."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,598.64,627.227,"I understand, Your Honor, but again, if you look at the language in the ADA which talks about qualified individuals who meet essential eligibility requirements... and it's in the context of title II, which is about public services, and I don't think that you can reasonably conclude that meeting the eligibility requirements to receive food stamps, or to get into a library or a museum, is the same as meeting the eligibility requirements to get into prison."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.227,635.693,"It isn't a matter of getting into prison, but once you're in prison, the eligibility requirements to use the prison exercise facilities, right?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,646.191,661.771,"There are eligibility requirements within a prison, but the difference is that public services are provided to the public for their benefit, and not all of the programs and activities and services of a prison are primarily for the benefit of the prisoner."
1997.97-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.771,666.025,"Okay, but you don't... the word public, I take it, you don't have a textual argument on that."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,673.909,676.413,"That's correct that that's our position, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.413,685.468,"Well then, public apparently means, I assume from the act, any person in relation to the Government."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,696.014,709.374,"Well, the public in the context of the ADA, which talks about assimilation of people immediately into free society, is very different from what happens with prisoners, where we take them out of society."
1997.97-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,709.374,713.598,"It is very different, but is it defined in the ADA anywhere?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,713.598,716.41,"The word public is not defined anywhere, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.41,731.999,"You said not all prison programs are for the benefit of the prisoner, but the very one we have before us surely is, this boot camp that allows a prisoner to save many, many months of incarceration, isn't that right?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,735.613,752.834,"Certainly there's a incidental benefit for the prisoner, but if you look at the Boot Camp Act, the General Assembly in Pennsylvania was seeking to deal with the problem of overcrowding in prison, and to deal with the problems of riots in prison, and that was the purpose of the statute."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.446,761.49,"What about mental, State mental institutions?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,766.496,767.617,"Yes, they are, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.617,769.858,Why is that different from prisons?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,775.223,783.107,"But in mental institutions, Your Honor, they're there because they need help, because they can't make decisions for themselves, and in many cases the court makes--"
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.107,786.209,"Well, that's all very true, but how does that bear upon the word public?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,786.209,787.489,--Because--
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.489,796.305,"I don't see any element of voluntary, or you know, having committed criminal acts in... there's just nothing in the word public that makes that distinction."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,796.305,798.986,--I think that a couple of differences.
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.009,820.982,"Well, but they've given... they're certainly deprived of rights."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,820.982,821.823,"They are, Your Honor--"
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.823,823.955,The basic right to walk out of the institution.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,823.955,829.217,"--They are, but they're there for their own help."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.862,836.483,"That's all very true, but how do you read that into the word public?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,837.054,838.216,I--
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.216,844.907,--You have to give me a text to... as the doorway to what you want to achieve.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,850.092,883.632,"--Again, looking at what the goals of Congress were in implementing the ADA and what they talked about, the different areas that there, had problems with, knowing that for 25 years and more this Court has consistently talked about the problems unique to prison management and have not applied the same constitutional analysis to prisoners, so I believe that when you look at the way prisoners are treated in the eyes of the Constitution, if you look at the--"
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,883.632,884.844,"Well, let me ask you this."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,896.461,898.384,--I don't think this Court would sanction it.
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.384,919.386,"I don't think so, either, and if Congress were enacting legislation based on its perception that handicapped people suffer from discriminatory attitudes and practices, then Congress might think that that should be stopped, just like the thing I just asked you about."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,920.287,949.296,"It's possible, Your Honor, but again, what Congress has done in... if they have tried to apply the ADA to State prisons, what they've done is applied a different standard now to how prison management have to deal with the disabled, and in your example of blacks in the cafeteria, this Court has held that the normal strict scrutiny analysis doesn't apply in the prison context when fundamental rights or a suspect class are involved."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,967.198,968.6,You wouldn't normally apply what?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,972.842,973.213,--I understand.
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,973.213,993.669,"--the context that you are concerned about, I think, and as I suggested before it's quite possible that concerns for prison security would be relevant in deciding what specific action a prison has to take with regard to a specific handicapped prisoner."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,993.669,1001.732,"Again, Your Honor, the problem is that applying the ADA in title II to State prisoners will shift the burden."
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.535,1035.163,"What sort of things practically, Mr. Tufano, do you envision happening if the Third Circuit opinion is upheld, or what sort of things are the prison administrators going to be confronted with?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1035.163,1050.954,"--Well, one of the things, and we cite it in our brief, Your Honor, is in the Purcell case, where an inmate was told that he had a doctor's appointment, and he refused to go to the doctor's appointment because he wanted to go into a cell and release his tics because he had Tourette's Syndrome."
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.954,1052.496,Release his what?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1052.496,1056.579,"His tics, his... the emotional outbursts which are--"
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.579,1058.382,"Oh, t-i-c-s."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1058.382,1058.6,--Yes.
1997.97-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.6,1059.231,Okay.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1060.803,1062.225,A different kind of tics.
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.187,1071.355,"I still don't understand the expression, to release the tics, but--"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1075.306,1090.008,"--But in that case... in that case, a simple situation where an inmate is telling a corrections guard, I don't have to go to my medical appointment, and he was given the opportunity to sign a release if he didn't go to the appointment."
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.246,1156.511,"Why is it different than under title VI, with race discrimination?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1156.511,1158.964,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1997.97-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1158.964,1167.72,"Why is it any different... Congress has said, here's a class, and thou shalt not discriminate, but we recognize the need for reasonable regulations."
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1181.307,1208.847,"The difference is, Your Honor, it's one thing to say, thou shalt not discriminate on the basis of race, it's another thing, in the Americans With Disabilities Act, to say you shall not discriminate on the basis of disability in a program activity or service and you shall affirmatively make accommodations for this person, and you shall only pick your course of action if you can show that there wasn't anything else available according to what the inmate wanted."
1997.97-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.847,1219.231,"Well now, Mr. Tufano, the Federal regulations dealing with the application of this act say things such as the following:"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1262.121,1265.784,"It might at first glance, Your Honor, but a couple of points."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.109,1323.363,"Mr. Tufano, what responsibility does the Justice Department have for the administration of this law?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1328.999,1329.79,--I believe that they--
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.79,1330.651,Does it do anything else?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1330.651,1339.006,"--I believe that they have responsibility in the compliance section, Your Honor, with regard to complaints under the ADA."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.006,1340.759,What is that?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1342.79,1346.353,"They could be made to them, if not brought into court."
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.353,1347.652,And what do they do when complaints are made to them?
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1348.454,1352.216,"They can, is my understanding, but again--"
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.216,1355.217,"I mean, that's the same with any criminal law, isn't it?"
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1355.217,1361.702,"--Well, it's not the same with any criminal law, and that's part of our concern about the ADA, Your Honor, is that--"
1997.97-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.702,1370.008,We usually don't let the Justice Department say what our criminal laws mean by issuing regulations interpreting those criminal laws.
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1405.5,1420.202,"--The problem is, Your Honor, in attempting to do that under either the section 5 enforcement powers of the Fourteenth Amendment or under the Commerce Clause, there's no basis to do that to lift the standard above which this Court has held."
1997.97-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.202,1422.293,But now you're getting--
1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1443.069,1448.012,"Well, the special problem is the unique situation of prisons."
1997.97-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.693,1451.063,They should be able to be unreasonable but nobody else should?

1997.97-634,0,38398,paul_a_tufano,,1511.225,1517.891,"Well, because I believe that... Congress I don't believe made a clear statement in the ADA."

1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1671.763,1672.364,Yes.
1997.97-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.476,1677.767,Under 504?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1677.767,1678.178,Yes.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.178,1682.67,Does the Rehab Act apply to Federal prisons?

1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.331,1687.054,"Yes, and it's basically the same provision?"

1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.775,1689.064,What is section 504?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1689.064,1691.687,"That's the Rehabilitation Act, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.687,1692.588,"Oh, the Rehabilitation Act."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1692.588,1693.867,I'm sorry.
1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.867,1699.831,"The Rehabilitation Act covers Federal facilities and... which came first, the Rehabilitation Act?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1699.831,1702.074,"The Rehabilitation Act came in 1973, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.074,1713.331,"Which covers only federally funded programs in the Federal Government, and then the ADA essentially extended the same thing more generally to all State and public institutions."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1713.331,1715.414,I couldn't have said it any more clearly.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1715.414,1722.307,What's been the history of litigation from prisoners in the Federal system under the Rehab Act?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1722.307,1732.415,"To my knowledge, Your Honor, there haven't been very many reported cases of Federal prisoners suing under the Rehabilitation Act."
1997.97-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.6,1744.432,Is the Federal Government liable for punitive damages in the event of default?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1744.432,1746.282,"I don't think it is, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.282,1747.694,So that's the big difference.

1997.97-634,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.451,1754.85,"Well, punitive--"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1758.612,1760.074,--It depends on your perspective.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1760.074,1762.246,And attorney's fees recoverable?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1762.246,1764.577,"Yes, they are, Your Honor, just as they're recoverable--"
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1764.577,1765.027,Under ADA.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1765.027,1767.409,"--Yes, but I would like to mention, Your Honor--"
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.409,1773.452,"Now, is there a federal enforcement arm under the Justice Department or not?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1773.452,1778.605,--The Justice Department has the authority to enforce the ADA.
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.871,1789.263,Is that by statute?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1789.263,1790.543,"That's by statute, yes."
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.543,1793.107,By provisions of the ADA?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1793.107,1818.452,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would like to mention in response to Justice O'Connor's question about the potential for litigation under this act, the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, many of the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act which would drastically limit the abilities of prisoners to sue State officials, applies to many of the provisions of the act, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.452,1821.043,"Well, how do you think that they drastically limit it?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1821.043,1824.546,"They impose filing fees, they have certain--"
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.546,1835.004,"Well, but if some lawyer thought there was the potential for attorney's fees and punitive damages in a case, I assume the attorney would pay filing fees."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1835.004,1854.725,"--That is true, Your Honor, but I can tell you from 20 years of experience in prison litigation that there are very few lawyers out there who are willing to take these cases, so... but your theoretical concern is a real one, but practically, there aren't that many prison lawyers out in the real world."
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.725,1881.483,"Supposing, Mr. Specter, that a criminal defendant in Pennsylvania has just been convicted and he's going to be in prison for a long period of time, and the judge sentences him to a regular prison, can he make an argument that, you know, I've got a heart condition and therefore I should go to a special... to a more lenient prison for that reason?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1881.483,1883.345,"I wouldn't call it more lenient, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.335,1901.089,I'm not talking about somebody who uses a wheelchair.

1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.191,1937.042,Why not?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1937.042,1943.725,Because most prison systems have medical facilities for people who have medical conditions.
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.748,1963.21,Without benefit of the ADA?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1963.21,1964.539,--Even without the benefit of the ADA.
1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.539,1968.382,"The ADA only requires reasonable accommodation, isn't that right?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1968.382,1969.033,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.033,1982.391,"And what would constitute reasonable accommodation in a prison is not necessarily the same thing that would constitute reasonable accommodation in some other public facility, isn't that so?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1982.391,1983.953,"I agree with that completely, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1983.953,1989.065,And in this case we didn't get into any of that.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,1999.814,2001.637,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly correct."

1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2026.583,2026.682,--Yes.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.682,2030.495,--it will be a severe hazard to your health?

1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2031.246,2037.36,And it's a serious risk to you to engage in this program in any meaningful way.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2037.36,2052.36,"--If they can prove that, Your Honor, and they can prove that the person's participation in the program in that way is an essential requirement of the program, then they have no liability."
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.36,2054.764,"And they're not a qualified individual, I assume--"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2054.764,2055.132,Exactly.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2055.132,2055.732,--under the statute.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2057.175,2058.955,That's exactly right.
1997.97-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.955,2072.164,"And you share, I take it, my concern that the requirements of the statute should be interpreted in light of the prison need for security."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2072.164,2073.223,"I do, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2102.905,2111.323,"Suppose the prison official said, this person can really participate in only about half of our program."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2142.087,2155.985,"Well, Your Honor, if you go to the appendix of, the last page of the appendix of our brief, you'll find the boot camp schedule, and you'll notice that the physical activity covers about 40 minutes of--"
1997.97-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.985,2157.745,"Well, use my hypothetical."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2157.745,2157.955,--Okay.
1997.97-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.955,2158.526,Use my hypothetical.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2158.526,2159.307,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2178.391,2184.502,"Well, suppose they could have a twotrack program, for some people do it half-a-day, some people do it a full day, would they have to do that?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2184.502,2189.697,"They don't have to operate a separate program, Your Honor, but they do have to make reasonable accommodations."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.612,2201.064,How does that work in the statute?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2212.802,2213.323,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.323,2234.496,"Well, it uses the word reasonable in respect to modification to rules, policies, or practices, and then when you get to the provision of auxiliary aids and services the word reasonable doesn't easily fit there, but it wouldn't make sense not to have it fit, so how... and it similarly wouldn't make... I mean, I don't think the statute intends to make people do things that are not reasonable."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2234.496,2235.035,It doesn't.
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.035,2237.649,So how is that worked out in the interpretation?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2237.649,2249.317,"Well, auxiliary aids and services is, the difference is because in auxiliary aids and services you cannot participate in a program without them."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.318,2255.822,"Well, why isn't a... is auxiliary service like an extra boot camp?"
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2257.321,2257.491,"--No, no."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.784,2268.698,"--Yes, but suppose the person argues, in my case what it requires is the following, because of the boot camp something costs $1 billion."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2269.379,2270.648,Okay.
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.648,2272.601,--Which would be totally unreasonable.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2277.075,2277.917,"Oh, surely, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.917,2280.428,How does the word reasonable come into it?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2280.428,2302.221,"Well, the regulations, which were specifically incorporated into the statute within the text of the act itself that were promulgated under section 504 and carried over to section (a) have an undue burden defense, so when the prison can say, this would be an undue financial or administrative burden, they have a defense to liability."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.221,2304.384,And is that true also of architectural barriers?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2304.384,2311.016,"Architectural barriers in existing facilities, I believe it's true."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.121,2320.075,Even if it costs $10 billion to build a one-room shack.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2320.075,2320.873,"Well, it doesn't."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.873,2322.205,"But I mean, if it did."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2325.878,2327.038,"I would think so, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.038,2329.401,But you're not sure.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2329.401,2334.523,"But I can't point to any part of the regulation, because this is not a structural accessibility case."
1997.97-634,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2334.523,2346.23,"Mr. Specter, the reasonable accommodation standard crops up in various places in the law, and one is in title VII in reasonable accommodation to religious practices."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2346.23,2346.811,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2346.811,2357.378,Are there other examples that one would look to if we want to understand this concept of reasonableness and how it relates to expense?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2357.378,2374.419,"Well, I think the clearest way to look to read what Congress meant about reasonableness in the ADA is to look at the great body of law that's developed under section 504, which has applied the reasonable... basically the same regulations that are... were incorporated into the ADA."
1997.97-634,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.305,2408.822,Mr. Tufano told us what he's concerned about is turning all these matters into Federal cases.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2408.822,2410.512,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2558.401,2559.202,Mr. Specter--
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2559.202,2559.432,Yes.
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.432,2566.699,--do you agree with Mr. Tufano that the State did not raise any constitutional argument in the lower courts?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2566.699,2569.19,"Emphatically, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2616.45,2619.321,Just one question.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2649.273,2653.583,"Well, that might even not be necessary in this case, Your Honor."
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2653.583,2654.284,"Well, if it was necessary."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2654.284,2657.746,If it was necessary and they could make reasonable modifications--
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2657.746,2661.09,Sort of on the scale of light duty in the post office or something like that.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2661.09,2677.51,"--Yes, Your Honor, with one major qualification, and that... two major qualifications, and that are... they are that it didn't fundamentally alter the essential requirements of the program and that it didn't cause an undue financial or administrative burden."
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2677.51,2681.112,"Yes, and... I understand that, but that's... we both know that that's tough."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2715.454,2721.278,"If it substantially limited their major life activities, yes."
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2721.278,2740.671,"Well, let's say it's in Pennsylvania in the employment context some... you can prove, this individual can prove that claustrophobia is my disability, and let's say this person has a history of claustrophobia as a disability, and the... as soon as he's sentenced by the judge he says, I have claustrophobia."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2743.103,2745.123,You might not be able to.
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2755.151,2763.697,But we both know it's a little bit more... reasonable accommodation is a bit more difficult than our discussion's been so far.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2763.697,2770.97,"I don't think the task that Congress gave to district courts is necessarily easy in every case, but I think--"
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2770.97,2773.234,But we know under 504 it's pretty difficult.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2773.234,2773.894,--Yes.
1997.97-634,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2773.894,2774.411,Okay.
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2774.411,2774.731,I think it's a task--
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.731,2775.062,Well--
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2775.062,2777.363,--that the district courts are up to.
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.363,2781.998,--Did Congress give the task to district courts or to prison administrators?
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2781.998,2785.74,"Well, hopefully they... district courts will not have to deal with this."
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.359,2799.66,"Very well, Mr. Specter."
1997.97-634,1,21601,donald_specter,,2799.66,2800.869,--yield the rest of my time to Mr. Gornstein.
1997.97-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.869,2802.422,Mr. Gornstein.
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2802.422,2815.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2881.135,2892.092,"I think I'm very interested, Mr. Gornstein, if it does apply, how you interpret the accommodation that's required in the prison context."
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2892.092,2896.406,"--Well, there would be two things you would look to."
1997.97-634,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2945.64,2962.129,"Mr. Gornstein, how much litigation has there been on the section 504, because that's been around for a couple of decades, involving prisons, either Federal prisons or State prisons receiving Federal assistance?"
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2962.129,2965.101,"There has not been a lot relating to prisons, very little."
1997.97-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.101,2969.285,Are damages available under the Rehab Act?
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2969.285,2982.453,"Damages are available under the Rehab Act with respect to State prisons, not federally assisted prisons, but not with respect to Federal correctional--"
1997.97-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2982.453,2989.637,"Right, so that might indicate why there's less litigation, and no punitive damages."
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2989.637,3008.231,"--It might, but the thing that I wanted to add about that is that the Prison Litigation Reform Act now does have a prison that... a provision that relates to damages, which can only be recovered when there is physical injury."
1997.97-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3017.888,3020.35,But under... and that would cover the ADA--
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3020.35,3020.68,It would.
1997.97-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3020.68,3021.091,--as well?
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3021.091,3021.772,It would.
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3021.772,3025.194,Tell us a little bit more about how the boot camp might work.
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3072.55,3083.626,"I think that the real difference would not come in in measuring undue burden but would come in in the question of security, deferring to security interests."
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3090.489,3096.014,"Well, let's say in each case you can do it for $5,000, second track, a second track for the school $5,000, second track for the prisoners."
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3096.014,3096.884,--There's a question--
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.884,3097.975,Is the calculus just the same?
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3097.975,3108.011,"--There would be a question that would arise whether you have to do any sort of new and separate program at all, whether that... regardless of how much it might cost."
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3112.275,3120.198,"Why wouldn't you in the boot camp hypothetical, if it's feasible to do for $5,000 a prisoner, or $5,000 a student?"
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3120.198,3134.06,I think that the question is whether you're being denied access to services or a program that is being provided by the institution.
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3143.634,3145.217,"$5,000."
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3145.217,3156.993,"If rigorous physical exercise is an essential part of that program, and there is no... it wouldn't matter how much money it would cost to construct another one, it would be a different program."
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3156.993,3162.207,Let's assume that we think it might work if it's altered for this person.
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3168.341,3181.251,"If it doesn't substantially change the nature of the program, then if it's not costly, then it may have to be provided under the ADA and section 504 as well."
1997.97-634,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.513,3233.154,"Through the regulations, or through the statute?"
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3237.237,3238.249,The statute--
1997.97-634,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3238.249,3239.908,"--It's as clear as this one, you say."
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3240.129,3240.83,--It's perfectly clear what the--
1997.97-634,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.83,3242.031,You wouldn't disagree with that.
1997.97-634,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3242.031,3243.412,--I would not disagree with that.
1997.97-634,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.95,3287.542,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
1997.97-634,3,38398,paul_a_tufano,,3289.854,3292.506,"Your Honor, I have no further rebuttal."
1997.97-634,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.506,3293.507,Very well.
