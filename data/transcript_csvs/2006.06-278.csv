2006.06-278,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.526,"The Court will hear argument first today in case 06-278, Morse vs. Frederick."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,6.263,9.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,41.389,44.7,"Well, is this case limited to signs about drugs?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,48.042,52.726,The rule the Court... that it articulated in Tinker.
2006.06-278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,65.612,66.673,Disruptive of what?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,70.862,72.453,Including but not limited to.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,82.23,88.792,"Well, I can understand if they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be disruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,88.792,91.101,--The educational mission of the school.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,91.101,95.429,"No, but I mean, that's at a level of generality that doesn't get us very far."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,101.052,110.048,"5520, a school policy of the board that says emphatically that political speech is protected, embracing Tinker."
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,110.048,121.997,"Then if that's the rule, the school can make any rule that it wants on any subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive under Tinker."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,121.997,123.213,Not at all.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,124.949,125.994,Then I'm missing the argument.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,125.994,143.05,"--The argument is that this Court in Tinker articulated a rule that allows the school boards considerable discretion both in identifying the educational mission and to prevent disruption of that mission, and this is disruptive of the mission--"
2006.06-278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.05,147.03,"Well, suppose you have... suppose you have a mission to have a global school."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,149.28,153.574,"--Absolutely not, because under Tinker that is political expression."
2006.06-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,158.278,184.282,"So if the sign had been ""Bong Stinks for Jesus"", that would be, and Morse had the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be a protected right under Tinker because the message was not promoting drugs?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,184.282,192.983,She stated in her answers to interrogatories that she may very well not have interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize marijuana.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,200.728,202.117,What would be disorderly?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,224.402,225.575,--I--
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,225.575,228.246,"It's political speech, it seems to me."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,240.039,240.788,--No.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.88,249.925,If it's calling... I mean--
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,249.925,251.004,--We think it's a First... I'm sorry.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,251.004,257.014,"--A call for a change in the law, I would have supposed, was political speech."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,257.014,258.266,That wasn't the interpretation.
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,267.682,269.402,"Well, that may be, but that's not the hypo."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,311.525,314.102,--But our... the answer is no.
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.556,353.896,So you want to get away from a hypothetical then.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,365.97,368.61,"--Well, it's certainly not this case, but--"
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.61,374.093,"This banner was interpreted as meaning smoke pot, no?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,374.093,376.811,"--It was interpreted... exactly, yes."
2006.06-278,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,382.106,396.522,"Are you arguing that there should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates illegal drug use, or this broader argument that the school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with its educational mission as the school--"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,396.522,397.474,--I think that--
2006.06-278,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,397.474,397.957,--defines it?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,397.957,398.675,--I apologize.
2006.06-278,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,433.24,451.217,"But the problem... the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well beyond education or protection from illegal substances, and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards have adopted policies taking on the whole range of political issues."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,458.618,461.445,"--No, because that may very well be inconsistent with Tinker."
2006.06-278,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,466.491,472.489,"Well, I think that... I think you're right about that, and I guess my question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,497.539,507.096,"--This Court has not read Tinker quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are worthy of note."
2006.06-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.313,517.47,But it may have made a difference in Tinker.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,545.818,561.858,"--No, it should not, because there... I think there are concerns with respect to what this Court has identified it is trying to, even in the public school setting, quite apart from the university setting, to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas."
2006.06-278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,570.464,581.429,"Yes, but the rule you proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that the school has wide discretion to define its educational mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent with that mission."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,581.429,582.381,--And that's what this Court in--
2006.06-278,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.381,584.724,And it seems to me that's much broader than Tinker.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,600.03,616.148,"--Justice Kennedy, the words that you articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and Kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in those two cases than one might see in Tinker."
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.254,634.969,Why do we have to get into the question of what the school board's policy is and what things they can make its policy?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,659.318,660.004,--Of course.
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.897,661.646,"Of course it would, so--"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,661.646,662.785,--The answer is yes.
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.785,673.25,"--Why can't we decide this case on that narrow enough ground, that any school whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress speech that advocates violation of the law?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,673.25,682.794,"I think it can, but it raises some interesting potential hypothetical questions, what about listening to the voice of Martin Luther King Junior, conscientious objection and so forth."
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.055,695.007,Does it have--
2006.06-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.007,698.552,Let me just clear up one thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,710.53,713.373,"Not inherently disruptive, but in fact... the answer is yes."
2006.06-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.437,718.154,And so we're focusing on the message and that's the whole crux of the case.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,718.154,720.107,--That's why this case is here because of the message.
2006.06-278,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.107,720.934,"Well, why is that?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,728.854,730.414,It may very well be.
2006.06-278,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.414,735.726,We are going to visit the state capital and we are not marching down the street with 15 foot banners.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,738.159,738.678,It does not.
2006.06-278,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.748,757.247,You just said suppose... why should I not say that?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,775.958,778.457,--In my opinion it is a correct statement of the law.
2006.06-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.933,798.449,It's also critical here to your case that it was a school event.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,803.039,812.913,"--If Mr. Frederick had seen fit to go down Glacier Avenue to J and J's, a popular hangout, there would have been no high school jurisdiction."
2006.06-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.878,821.438,Suppose it were Saturday instead of a weekday.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,821.438,822.081,I beg your pardon.
2006.06-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.081,825.064,"Suppose it were Saturday, not a school day."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,843.851,844.6,No.
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.258,893.067,"--Mr. Starr, you... you responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on a trip."
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,896.269,897.61,--I don't believe so.
2006.06-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.61,899.548,"And if not... if not, what's the difference?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,899.548,905.297,"Because of the potential for disruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment that is entrusted to--"
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,905.297,909.543,But don't we have to be more specific about the context in determining whether there's disruption?
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,962.1,963.429,"--Your Honor, the answer is no."
2006.06-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,978.112,978.548,All right.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1017.298,1027.089,"--Your Honor, with all due respect, the key is to allow the school official to interpret the message as long as that interpretation is reasonable."
2006.06-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1044.068,1053.907,But those were the words and characterizing them as offensive/but here one could look at these words and say it's just nonsense.
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1062.576,1074.305,"Your Honor, again, Deborah Morse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the message in light of the subculture of the school where drug use is a serious problem."
2006.06-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.629,1093.58,"Is that a judgment clear enough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate as to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the message?"
2006.06-278,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1099.936,1101.34,"--Yes, I believe you do."
2006.06-278,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1118.069,1118.709,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1131.234,1134.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1152.291,1156.554,"And is that the rationale on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more broad?"
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.554,1159.256,The Court need not decide anything more broadly than that.
2006.06-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.256,1162.458,I'm asking what your recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1162.458,1175.782,"Well, I think this is a manifestation of the principle articulated in Earls and repeated in Hazelwood that a, school does not have to tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic educational--"
2006.06-278,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1175.782,1197.303,"Well, that's a very... I find that a very, a very disturbing argument, because schools have and they can defined their educational mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of political speech and speech expressing fundamental values of the students, under the banner of, of... of getting rid of speech that's inconsistent with educational missions."
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1197.303,1206.268,"--That's why I think there would, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for the Court to articulate a rule that had to do with encouraging illegal conduct and particularly--"
2006.06-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.268,1207.454,"Well, why go into this?"
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1229.166,1237.663,"--Well... I think, I think a school could certainly prohibit the display of banners on a school trip or in a school assembly."
2006.06-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.663,1242.05,"Suppose that this particular person had whispered to his next door neighbor,"
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1247.953,1249.938,And that may well... that may well be different.
2006.06-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.062,1251.576,No.
2006.06-278,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1278.628,1278.881,--No.
2006.06-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.276,1301.618,"Well, then you're not arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what you said at the first."
2006.06-278,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1301.618,1310.412,"Well, there are several gradations that the Court could take: Advocacy of illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of illegal drugs."
2006.06-278,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.667,1344.085,But that's a viewpoint-neutral regulation.
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1349.115,1349.52,--No.
2006.06-278,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1398.269,1412.182,"So... so you think that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete button that says ""legalize marijuana"", although it might be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it could be inconsistent with the school's mission and prohibited on that basis?"
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1412.182,1423.958,"--Well, I think... I think if, if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum in the State, then that, that might be the category of political speech that could not be regulated."
2006.06-278,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.958,1436.269,"And at... at this very rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay to work for change in existing law which such a sign would be, but it is not okay to violate the law."
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1440.266,1447.621,"But... but the, what was happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to encourage the use of illegal drugs."
2006.06-278,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.621,1448.685,All right.
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1490.652,1500.694,"Well, I... I... I think in, in this Court's decisions dealing with public schools, this Court has, has a consistent theme as to give deference to the judgments by the educators."
2006.06-278,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.914,1504.101,Do we have to give... let me ask you this.
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1512.235,1512.75,--Yes.
2006.06-278,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.75,1517.359,"In other words, if we give deference your argument wins."
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1523.186,1527.37,I don't think the question is what Mr. Frederick intended.
2006.06-278,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.974,1544.8,"What if the sign said ""bong hits should be legal""?"
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1544.8,1548.536,"--I, I think that would be a judgment call."
2006.06-278,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.564,1554.108,Under your view wouldn't the principal's judgment always prevail?
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1554.108,1558.062,"--Well it has to be a reasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in Frazier."
2006.06-278,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.062,1559.965,Is that a question of fact or a question of law?
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1559.965,1560.359,Pardon me?
2006.06-278,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.359,1562.527,Is whether it's a reasonable judgment--
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1562.527,1565.682,"I think ultimately it's a question of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment."
2006.06-278,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.682,1572.386,"This, this... this parade had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with... the high school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it."
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1592.58,1593.095,Yes.
2006.06-278,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.778,1605.979,Is that different from the rationale you've put.
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1605.979,1606.572,Yes.
2006.06-278,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.155,1639.967,"But it wasn't, it wasn't like an assembly, was it?"
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1668.328,1671.827,"The students' present at the event, presence as the event, was like an assembly."
2006.06-278,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.865,1699.475,Were they required to go to this event and could they have skipped off and gone home without violating--
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1699.475,1700.504,--They were not allowed to go home.
2006.06-278,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.955,1703.331,--They were required to attend.
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1703.331,1711.64,"--They were required to be there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go out there, but they were under school supervision at that time."
2006.06-278,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.64,1725.979,"Were they ever told what they were supposed to do in the sense did the school ever say, we are letting you out on the street to celebrate the Olympics and to do only that?"
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1733.037,1737.818,"If I may, I don't think there's any question that he knew in advance that this was about the Olympics."
2006.06-278,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.298,1749.107,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2006.06-278,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1749.107,1749.531,Thank you.
2006.06-278,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1749.531,1754.09,Mr. Mertz.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1754.09,1760.353,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This is a case about free speech.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.537,1764.677,It's a case about money.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1768.987,1776.329,"He does have a damages claim against the school district and the principal, but that's by no means his chief object here."
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.952,1789.747,"Well, would you waive damages against this principal who has devoted her life to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for this sophomoric sign that was held up?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1789.747,1794.431,--We are certainly willing to negotiate a minimum settlement of damages.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.838,1811.923,But there's a broader issue of whether principals and teachers around the country have to fear that they're going to have to pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take actions pursuant to established board policies that they think are necessary to promote the school's educational mission.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1811.923,1828.949,"That is indeed a legitimate fear, Your Honor, and we believe the existing law takes care of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be breached that there be a demonstration that under the existing law at the time available to her--"
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.949,1839.021,"And you think it was clearly established that she had to allow a student at a school-supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner saying 4 Jesus> [""]?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1839.021,1852.736,"--I think it was clearly established at the time, Your Honor, that a principal could not engage in viewpoint censorship of a nondisruptive expression, under both Ninth Circuit law and this Court's law."
2006.06-278,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.313,1866.041,"Does that, does that general statement that you just made apply to all circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship might be involved?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1872.086,1876.382,--The rule on qualified immunity?
2006.06-278,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1876.382,1882.521,"Yes, the general rule which the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1915.164,1920.677,I believe the analysis would be the Tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption of the lesson.
2006.06-278,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.677,1922.818,"Well, would there be a substantial disruption?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1922.818,1925.111,It would all depend on the circumstances.
2006.06-278,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1928.11,1931.891,"If the kids look around and they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again--"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1945.789,1951.553,--I believe that in circumstances where it is a substantial distraction--
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1951.553,1956.911,Can't it just say no signs when you're supposed to be learning?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1956.911,1965.206,"--Your Honor, I think the answer is yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting signs in school."
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1967.221,1986.961,But can't the school decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it takes a particular view with respect to signs that in their view seem to encourage drug use?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,1986.961,1991.492,--Certainly it is within the school's mission to discourage drug use.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.469,2015.559,So your position would be different if this were in the student gym and they were having a discussion.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2023.183,2024.946,"--No, I'm not so sure."
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.946,2026.697,So it doesn't matter that this is outside.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2031.505,2042.034,"Well, what matters is whether there is a substantial disruption of what the school is trying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom lesson or a lesson on drug use."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.034,2056.356,"Well, but the school has... the school has a program, an anti-drug program that shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers to preach against drug use and you're saying that... never mind unfurling a banner."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2066.445,2068.054,"I believe, Your Honor--"
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.054,2069.085,Does the school have to do that?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2069.085,2078.252,"--I believe, Your Honor, that a nondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it, would have to be tolerated."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.422,2094.527,"But the school, even though it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow students to come in and undermine that point of view, assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of view?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2098.416,2099.493,I think that--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.493,2101.43,And that is not disruption in your view?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2101.43,2115.068,--I think they cannot prevent presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the school's own presentation of its viewpoint.
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2115.068,2121.112,"Can the student be allowed to wear a button that says ""Rape Is Fun""?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2121.112,2123.673,"No, I don't think so--"
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2123.673,2124.204,Why?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2124.204,2125.67,--There is a distinction there.
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2125.67,2126.107,Why?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2126.107,2133.263,"Because when you're talking about hate speech, speech that advocates violence, then you're in another category of speech."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.384,2143.101,"Nonviolent crimes are okay, it's only violent crimes that you can't, you can not promote, right?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2143.85,2145.179,--I think there is a--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.179,2148.271,"""Extortion Is Profitable"", that's okay?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2148.271,2149.925,--Well--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.925,2154.753,"This is a very, very, with all respect, ridiculous line."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2165.859,2167.59,"--No, I'm not saying only violent unlawful acts."
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2183.336,2194.454,"So it's a political... even assuming it's a political issue, the question is whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a forum for that debate?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2194.454,2201.999,--I believe it does not have to if being a forum would disrupt the school's own educational program and--
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2201.999,2206.277,And disruption does not include undermining the message they want to send?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2213.682,2218.397,"--Preventing a contrary viewpoint from being expressed, that we--"
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.397,2235.453,"Yes, but you rephrased it that way, but what actually happened is the principal looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at what's supposed to be a school event with everybody together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes a joke out of drug use."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2279.108,2282.013,"--My response, Your Honor, is that, first of all, a 14-foot banner."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.013,2285.339,"That's an excellent response, I think."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2286.244,2288.151,That was just a preliminary.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2299.086,2308.393,I conceive that interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a school where kids go around at public events publicly making a joke out of drugs.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2351.094,2376.003,I believe the answer is that the Tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise compromise between allowing school officials to have complete discretion to suppress student speech in order to maintain what they conceive of as their individual mission and the student's right to speak in a nondisruptive manner.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.782,2389.091,"Well, you can say that, but the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on it."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2394.792,2400.072,"--There have been some narrow exceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the Frazier and the Kuhlmeier cases."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.163,2415.314,--I think we're using disruption in two different senses here and we should probably separate the two.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2451.097,2458.814,"--If I understand your question correctly, the second of them might better be called allowing competing viewpoints."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.814,2462.016,So you think undermining is perfectly okay?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2467.701,2473.278,I think undermining in the sense of preventing impeding the school from delivering its--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.995,2475.543,"Okay, but only that."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2475.543,2476.822,--would be substantial disruption.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.822,2488.052,"Right after a class on drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say: This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use them all the time, I urge all of you."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2490.879,2493.301,I believe that is the kind of speech--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.301,2493.909,That's not disruption?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2493.909,2497.157,--that we must tolerate no matter how unwise it is.
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2497.157,2507.215,"But couldn't the school, couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner regulation that says you're not going to use the halls to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2507.215,2508.513,I believe that's correct.
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2508.513,2513.384,You could have reasonable rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school building.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2513.384,2513.871,Right.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.871,2517.4,Does the school have to be completely neutral in that respect?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2526.24,2545.231,"I think a content neutral, content neutrality is critical here, and if the school wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has an outside of the official forum--"
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2545.231,2558.01,"Where does that notion that our schools have to be content neutral... I thought we wanted our schools to teach something, including something besides just basic elements, including the character formation and not to use drugs."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2560.303,2565.786,--Content neutrality goes to what speech is suppressed or punished.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.406,2580.841,A school isn't an open forum.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2599.352,2601.364,"--I don't believe that's the case at all, Your Honor."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.364,2602.772,That's not my vision of what a school is.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2602.772,2611.597,"In the classroom delivering the prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the school wishes to present a particular message, that's one case."
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.964,2632.01,But do you concede that there was some right of school control for what was going on across the street?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2632.01,2632.993,No.
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.301,2647.223,"If kids were throwing bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no right or duty to go over there and stop it?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2647.223,2650.312,"--Oh, I think if they were engaging in an act of hooliganism--"
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2650.312,2654.078,"Well, that's because the school has a right of control."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2654.078,2655.607,--There is a distinction here.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2663.34,2665.045,Why did he go where he went?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2665.045,2665.809,--Pardon?
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.809,2668.167,Why did he choose that location to unfurl his banner?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2668.167,2673.63,He explained because it was the only place where he actually knew the route of the relay.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.63,2679.819,"But I mean, that's... I have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the teacher said."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2715.195,2717.301,"There is a major dispute on that point, Your Honor."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.77,2722.925,Just tell me where to look.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2731.671,2743.511,"--It would be on pages 32, 34, 36."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.511,2744.4,"Okay, I'll look at those."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2749.258,2749.773,Okay.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2762.36,2763.3,"No, they went across the street."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2763.3,2764.486,--Some of them did.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.515,2769.641,"Was there any... there was no requirement, they didn't have to go across the street or stay on campus, they could wander off distantly."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2769.641,2771.216,"--They could, and many of them did."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.216,2772.436,Okay.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2772.436,2777.717,"And there was no requirement that they stay together, no requirement that they do anything in particular."

2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2787.77,2788.382,But--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.382,2790.348,"It was not only the intent, it was the direction."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2790.348,2791.803,--Actually it was not.
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.065,2798.487,Was there any fact finding on that?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2800.487,2801.392,--No.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.779,2814.182,"Can I ask you another record point, just so I know where to look?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2814.182,2814.824,Yes.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.824,2821.447,You've also asked for an injunction that would require expunging his 5-day suspension from his record.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2821.447,2821.962,Correct.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.962,2822.586,10 days.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2860.351,2867.741,"The... whether it remains on the record, anything that remains on his record is obviously much more--"
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.741,2869.098,"No, but I'm asking that you think about it."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2871.411,2875.657,"--In that case, I missed the point of your--"
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.657,2878.501,I want to know what the superintendent said.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2915.596,2929.885,"--If the only thing left were discipline because he was tardy that day, was... didn't divulge the names of the other people holding the banner, that sort of thing, we couldn't--"
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2929.885,2932.274,I think it's--
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2932.274,2933.604,You couldn't what?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2936.695,2938.115,--Of answering the question.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.115,2938.583,--Yes.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2939.382,2942.194,Those things wouldn't manner anymore.
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.194,2943.66,So you would not pursue it?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2943.66,2944.487,Correct.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.487,2949.237,--Can we get back... I'm sorry.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.237,2949.955,Go ahead.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2949.955,2952.501,Can we get back to what the case is about.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,2982.285,2985.487,"Mr. Chief Justice, there are two different time points we have to talk about."
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.554,3023.066,And so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldn't do.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3023.066,3023.581,--Yes.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.581,3024.754,"As it is to us, right?"
2006.06-278,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3025.534,3037.311,"I mean, we have had a debate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker means, about the proper characterization of the behavior, the nonspeech behavior."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3063.925,3076.232,We believe at the very least she should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive holding of a sign because it said something you disagreed with.
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3076.232,3079.356,Of course I disagree with the characterization on disruptive.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3093.522,3098.428,"Well, they weren't sponsoring the Olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event actually."
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3101.691,3106.063,Some of the students were carrying the torch and the band was playing in the parade.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3106.063,3114.264,"--A few of the student... a few of the relay runners were from the school and had been allowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band played as it went by."
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3142.348,3150.42,"Now you said that in your brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got mileage out of his being truant that morning."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3166.167,3185.656,"--We believe it would be a closer question, but the fact that he was not there in school today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in a public place in a public event who was not acting as a student."
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3185.656,3186.748,"So he's not a school child, he would be playing hooky?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3186.748,3194.839,"Because he was playing hooky because he chose not to be there, because he was not part of the class."
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3194.839,3195.479,Even though the law required him to be there?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3195.479,3197.651,That's right.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.651,3199.246,He wasn't playing hooky.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3211.195,3212.006,He joined--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.006,3213.74,"As far as I'm concerned, he just showed up late."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3213.74,3218.688,--He joined a public crowd on a private side... public sidewalk in front of private homes.
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3222.549,3223.641,Where did he go immediately after?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3227.966,3228.672,Yes.
2006.06-278,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.265,3240.808,"So under your view, if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street, had to come up and say now, how many here are truants and how many here are... I can't discipline you because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the--"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3242.804,3244.773,"No, I don't think she needs to do that in the heat of the moment."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.317,3259.923,"Because you're both a truant and disrupter, you get off."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3262.656,3269.593,"Well, it may well be that he could have been punished for being truant, but of course that's not why we're here."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.447,3283.102,Who were the people that helped him hold up his flag?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3284.899,3288.038,Most of them were classmates; at least one was not a student.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.038,3298.753,"Did he not know that these classmates were there at a public event that was sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had--"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3300.126,3301.062,I'm sure he did know.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3301.062,3308.28,"So it seems to me it's like joining a school trip at the zoo, you know."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3318.353,3336.735,"A better analogy might be if he had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in some expressive act, and there happened to be a school group there at the same time, could the teacher with that group then have disciplined him for what he was doing?"
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.735,3337.955,That gets back to the point I was trying to make earlier.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3354.809,3355.667,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.799,3382.889,You think he could have been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't intend to be part of the school group afterwards?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3399.572,3402.598,--I think it would all depend on whether he--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.598,3403.023,That doesn't make any sense to me.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3408.943,3414.909,--I think that would depend on the fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.909,3416.563,He was either in school or he wasn't in school.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3416.563,3419.998,In the morning he wasn't in school.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.998,3421.933,In the afternoon he either was or he wasn't.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3421.933,3422.385,In the afternoon he was.
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.385,3432.18,"And the question is whether joining the school group, intentionally joining the school group, going there because the school group was there, whether that places him in school."
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3432.18,3442.3,"As a hypothetical, if he were intentionally joining a school group, I would have to say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the school has."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3442.3,3443.767,Why does it matter?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3475.052,3478.269,"As far as qualified immunity, I think that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief."
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3478.269,3479.127,But even on the merits?
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3479.127,3484.22,"On the merits I don't think so, because if he was not in fact there as part of a school group--"
2006.06-278,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3484.22,3492.589,"Even if the principal couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if he really wasn't?"
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3492.589,3501.76,--I do not believe there's anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because it's--
2006.06-278,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3501.76,3507.347,I thought you were going to appeal to the calm of her office the next day.
2006.06-278,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3513.049,3515.408,May I ask to you clarify one thing.
2006.06-278,4,21284,douglas_k_mertz,,3539.164,3540.526,--That is correct.
2006.06-278,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3569.763,3570.637,"Thank you, Mr. Mertz."
2006.06-278,5,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3573.48,3585.365,"For the reasons that have been discussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse, a conscientious principal, be subjected to the possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages."
2006.06-278,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3667.649,3669.864,"Thank you counsel, the case is submitted."
