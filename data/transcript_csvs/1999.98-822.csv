1999.98-822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.622,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-822, Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Environmental Services."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,62.055,64.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.559,154.23,"Well, I guess what happened, perhaps, was the district court handled this at a time before we'd handed down Steel Company."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,154.23,155.516,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.499,163.436,"And the Fourth Circuit reviewed it after that case had come down, and apparently placed some reliance on that, right?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,165.222,165.972,--It relied solely on Steel Company.
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.972,166.372,--Yes.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,169.107,170.44,That there--
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.44,174.928,So it boils down to what we meant in Steel Company--
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,174.928,176.794,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.794,178.196,--as applied to this case.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,178.196,190.67,"I think that's correct, and I think it also involves what the relationship of Steel Company is to this Court's prior decision in Gwaltney, because our argument is that Gwaltney is precisely this case."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.67,202.145,"Well, except Gwaltney didn't really get into the circumstances expressly, and I guess Steel Co. did, so we have to reconcile that in some way."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,202.145,206.197,"I think, Your Honor, that Gwaltney did get into the circumstances."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.453,226.527,"This is a jurisdictional point, and our cases are replete with the statements that actions by this Court on jurisdictional matters that do not discuss the jurisdictional matters are not precedential."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,226.527,228.128,"That's correct, Your Honor, but--"
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.128,231.93,And did Gwaltney discuss the jurisdictional matter explicitly?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,231.93,233.532,"--Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.234,239.27,This aspect of standing?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,239.27,258.915,"--It did not go into the exact aspects of Steel Company, but Your Honor found in Steel Company itself that Gwaltney had... that this Court in Gwaltney had upheld standing, and presumably found that that had been a reasonable determination."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.526,281.93,"Mr. Terris, do you think the Fourth Circuit may have confused mootness with standing?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,281.93,297.04,"I think it certainly confused mootness with standing, because what it did is take a decision of this Court in Steel Company and say that it applied in and of itself, with no further reasoning, to the decision, to the case before it."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.082,338.017,--thing if I may.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,348.824,350.207,That is true.
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.207,353.959,Does that moot the case perhaps?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,353.959,359.363,There is a substantial question about that--
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.363,359.88,Yes.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,359.88,360.399,--about that.
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.434,365.101,Yes.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,365.101,369.488,What the respective parties have presented to Your Honors is their views of the facts.
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.344,409.196,"May I ask this question, Mr. Terris."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,420.003,453.724,"We do not think so, because we think that under Walling v. James Reuter and the U.S. Bancorp decisions of this Court that when the voluntary actions of the defendant to in effect prevent a decision of a district court from being carried out, that in the interests of justice this Court has the power to vacate the court of appeals decision and to therefore let the district court decision continue to apply."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.724,469.75,"Mr. Terris, can I ask you, the premise of your argument is that it would surely be okay to grant the penalty relief if injunction relief had also been granted."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,469.75,471.319,Well--
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.319,474.604,You don't even think that's a debatable problem.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,474.604,475.837,"--I don't think it is, although the--"
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.837,476.721,Yes.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,476.721,477.806,--other side debates it.
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.806,496.85,"What cases do you know that have said it is a proper function of courts in private litigation to impose a public penalty, that is, a penalty that does not go to the plaintiff but that goes into the public Treasury?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,496.85,499.486,I think Gwaltney clearly holds that.
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.127,515.597,It's a major proposition to establish without any discussion about it.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,564.079,567.297,"--There are several... I have several answers, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.504,580.873,But Congress can't say anything.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,587.027,596.466,"I understand that, Your Honor, but I am saying that the Congress has said this is not private litigation, this is public litigation to carry out a public responsibility."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.466,597.033,I understand Congress has said it.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,599.335,600.485,Let me go on.
1999.98-822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,626.902,630.187,"Well, you didn't raise that question in your petition for certiorari."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,630.187,630.554,That's correct.
1999.98-822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.851,671.531,"This discussion began when we asked whether or not the pendency of an injunctive suit that's live allows you to collect civil penalties which are retroactive, and the respondent's brief quotes Lewis and Casey for the proposition that standing is not dispensed in gross."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,679.47,680.554,That's correct.
1999.98-822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.554,697.015,"So in light of those cases, why is it that you can argue, as you do, as you seem to do, that the impendancy of the injunctive action somehow confers standing to collect civil penalties for the past wrong?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,699.7,701.017,"That isn't the argument, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.983,727.368,--And you say that there is no standing requirement for the civil penalties.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,738.492,738.992,That--
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.992,750.55,"Or do you have to... do you take the position, rather, that there has to be a reliance on continuing violations of the statute to get the standing?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,752.085,762.941,"--Our position is that it is not enough that Congress has said we have the right to sue for civil penalties, any more than it's enough to say that we have the right to sue for injunctive relief."
1999.98-822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.634,781.787,So you want us to analyze this case as if you asked just for civil penalties.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,791.643,797.797,"I do not have to go that far, Your Honor, because, of course, we asked for injunctive relief, as in Gwaltney."
1999.98-822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.611,822.598,"But they would have to provide a benefit rather specifically, would they not?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,827.216,828.216,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.382,831.584,Finish.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,833.101,845.825,"--Yes, let me... the district court specifically held in this case that the civil penalties did deter, and we submit that that determination is entitled to weight."
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.527,850.661,But the court of appeals--
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,856.097,858.816,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.816,865.655,Did the district court find that the civil penalties deter conduct that has an adverse impact on your clients?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,865.655,878.546,"It basically found there was not enough likelihood of future violations to justify injunctive relief, because, of course... not a mootness ground."
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.438,897.107,"No, but what I want to be clear on, the civil penalties clearly would deter future violations."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,903.761,916.188,"Oh... the district court held that there was standing, the court of appeals assumed that there was standing, and we proved standing, so... but that issue, I submit to Your Honors, is not before you."
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.188,919.707,And did you prove that the violations adversely affected your clients?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,919.707,920.373,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.373,920.807,Okay.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,920.807,921.825,It's part of standing.
1999.98-822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,921.825,947.374,"But the court of appeals didn't review that, and one of the questions that I have is, assuming I would agree with you that this case is not moot, mustn't this Court stop there and say, whatever the district court found, the court of appeals didn't review it, so we would say, case not moot, court of appeals stop assuming standing, decide all these questions that you didn't decide."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,953.278,963.319,"I certainly don't think, Your Honor, that you should decide standing, which is... fact-intensive does not raise an issue that's involved in certiorari."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.71,977.194,It wasn't even decided in--
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,980.697,982.497,"--No, but there was a decision by the--"
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.497,983.097,So--
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,983.097,998.575,"--There was a decision by the court of appeals that it will not give attorney's fees if the case is moot, so it's very likely... if we go back to the district court on the closure question, it's very possible that that issue will continue to be lurking in the case."
1999.98-822,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,998.575,1002.277,--I just thought there was no final judgment as to the attorney's fees.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1002.277,1003.061,"Oh, I think there was."
1999.98-822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.813,1010.217,"And the court of appeals did not say, as I recall, that they would not award attorney's fees if it was not moot."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1010.217,1012.55,"That is true, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.519,1015.969,"Mr. Terris, could I come back to Justice Stevens' question?"
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1049.008,1054.912,"I think there is, Your Honor, because no other facilities was raised in the case in the district court."
1999.98-822,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1059.963,1062.082,Is the permit specific to the facility?
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1062.082,1062.732,Excuse me?
1999.98-822,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.232,1067.153,"So that when they retain the permit, it is for this location only."
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1067.153,1069.003,This and only this location.
1999.98-822,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.003,1069.338,Yes.
1999.98-822,0,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1069.338,1070.955,"I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.955,1072.54,"Very well, Mr. Terris."
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1074.14,1085.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-822,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.201,1154.759,"Well, is that consistent with its refusal to issue an injunction, because ordinarily, if you think there are going to be future activities that need to be deterred, you probably would issue an injunction, wouldn't you?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1160.765,1162.615,"No, I don't think that's the case, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1177.391,1177.841,No--
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1215.166,1215.833,--Your Honor--
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.833,1220.136,I find that an extraordinary upside-down approach to that.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1220.136,1225.355,"--Your Honor, I do not think it's extraordinary, because the court would not have simply wagged its finger at Laidlaw."
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.483,1241.917,It could have.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1242.883,1252.006,"It need not have, but this is why Congress gave courts the power to select the remedy that is most appropriate to ensure compliance."
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1252.006,1256.993,"But of course the civil penalty looks in both directions, doesn't it?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1256.993,1257.66,Its--
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1257.66,1266.598,"So that the court might have said, well, I'm going to award the civil penalty here in part because of what we find they have done, and in part for deterrent purposes."
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1269.986,1271.969,"--That's not what the court did in this case, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1273.188,1273.788,What did it say?
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1273.788,1280.858,"--It made quite clear its view on the use of civil penalties, and this appears in the joint appendix at pages 121 through 125."
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1280.858,1281.794,What did they say?
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1281.794,1289.881,"What they said, what the court said was that civil penalties here are available to deter future violations, and they do so by depriving--"
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1289.881,1292.0,So they construed it solely as deterrent in this case.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1292.0,1306.325,"--In this case, that is the approach the court took, and what's more, the court said the reason why it deters is because it will deprive the party of the economic benefit of noncompliance and thereby take away the incentive to commit future violations."
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.361,1310.677,"Of course, the penalty doesn't do that."
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1312.979,1319.233,--This penalty deprived Laidlaw of its... of the benefits of its past noncompliance--
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.233,1319.65,Right.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1319.65,1321.252,--and made clear that its future violations--
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.252,1322.469,That won't stop its future violations.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1336.612,1342.333,--But it's the application of the penalty that provides the assurance that it will be applied in the future as well.
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.249,1426.854,"--May I ask you the question I asked your... the other counsel: supposing the case became moot today, would you still be entitled to the money?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1426.854,1433.508,"Our view is, we might very well be entitled to the money, and the analysis goes as follows."
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.833,1449.352,Even after the district court has said there should be a penalty.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1449.352,1451.887,"No, I'm talking about, in that case before the district court."
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.887,1452.37,Oh--
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1452.37,1453.589,If the plant is closed after--
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.589,1459.66,"--I'm asking you... say it becomes moot after the district court makes a finding that they ought to pay $400,000 to the United States."
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1459.66,1465.646,--I think one of the inquiries that has to be made on remand is whether that closure was prompted by the court's judgment.
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.663,1470.031,You seem to be dodging my question.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1471.3,1471.75,--Yes.
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.75,1479.923,"Assume it's moot, and everybody agrees it would be moot, except for the fact there may be a fight over whether or not they still have to pay the money, would that prevent it from being moot?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1479.923,1496.516,"If it's clearly moot, and it was not caused by the... the closing was not caused by the entry of the judgment, in that case we think the appropriate course would be under Bonner Mall and the Walling v. Reuter case to remand the case to the district court with the reimposition of the district court's judgment, and that's governed by--"
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.516,1497.785,To reimpose the district court's judgment.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1497.785,1499.168,--Reimpose the district court's judgment.
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.168,1500.237,"And so then, you think they'd have to pay the money."
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1500.237,1500.837,They'd have to pay the money.
1999.98-822,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.837,1501.503,That's what I was trying ask you.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1501.853,1504.689,And the reason for that is simply as a matter of interest of justice.
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.996,1517.262,And then that's... I'm sorry.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1549.817,1555.554,The reason why the penalty is still enforced in that situation is to avoid the gamesmanship that would otherwise result.
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.56,1567.862,"Would the injunction stand, if they had issued an injunction?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1567.862,1574.718,"--Yes, and in fact the Walling case involved the imposition of an injunction, and the injunction was on appeal to this court."
1999.98-822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.746,1596.964,Excuse me.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1601.452,1610.874,"I believe the injunction was still reinstituted, and the court indicated it would be up to the parties to determine what could be enforced in that situation."
1999.98-822,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1610.874,1613.41,So it was left as a matter of discretion.
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1616.745,1617.145,Yes.
1999.98-822,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.131,1675.983,"--Well, what about Steel Company, though?"
1999.98-822,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1675.983,1685.856,"Steel Company is distinguishable, because in that case... if I may finish my answer... it involved a wholly past violation in which civil penalties would have no future deterrent effect."
1999.98-822,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.708,1687.858,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1689.993,1694.545,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.22,1764.041,What ruling of the district court is that?
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1764.041,1769.259,It was the district court's 1997 ruling on liability.
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1783.103,1786.388,Thank you.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1810.468,1810.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.631,1831.164,"Well, what about treble damage plaintiffs in antitrust cases?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1839.97,1846.39,"I think in State law... obviously, the Federal system has a separation of power consideration that State law doesn't."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.646,1865.585,"If he gets $13.50 he can put a million into the Treasury, but if in fact what he gets is some assurance that there won't be pollution again, he can't put the money in the Treasury."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1865.585,1875.041,"Well, to answer the first part of it, if you got $13.50 out of a million dollar judgment, I'm not sure that's enough of a personal stake, but I know--"
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.041,1876.159,I sometimes exaggerate.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1884.999,1887.617,"--No, it's not, Your Honor, and there's a lot of--"
1999.98-822,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.617,1890.236,"And this Court has never faced the question, has it?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1890.236,1903.393,"--It has not, and... but my point is that at least that qui tam plaintiff has some personal stake by virtue of the statute, the False Claims Act, giving that quit tam plaintiff a--"
1999.98-822,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.393,1906.245,"Quit tam squared, you might say."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1906.245,1910.38,"--I'll agree with that, although I'm not sure I understand it."
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1910.982,1916.97,We have learned not to do that.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,1962.415,1966.534,"I don't think that's completely correct, Your Honor, for this reason."
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.817,2034.88,"I thought that the district court suggested that the plaintiff was the galvanizing factor and that the defendant itself had tried to get the State into the act and, indeed, drafted the pleadings for the State court suit that was filed, and that was all a nice cozy deal between the defendant and the State."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2034.88,2036.13,--The district court did not find that.
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.13,2049.822,"Well, the district court did say, I am not going to do what the statute, if everything was above-board would require, that is, not take this case because there is an adequate remedy going on in the State court."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2058.413,2058.963,Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.493,2121.653,"Well, why did the district court say, and one of the reasons that I'm not giving injunctive relief, it's not simply that I assigned a whopping penalty, but down the road there will be substantial counsel fees?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2121.653,2130.092,"The district court did say that, and it underscores the uncertain nature of penalties."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.771,2207.425,"What do you mean when you say, penalties have to have a specific effect, Mr. Cockrill?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2207.425,2225.654,"What I mean, Your Honor, is to redress an injury under Article III, it... the burden on the plaintiff is to show that the relief requested, that there is a substantial likelihood that that relief will redress that injury."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.654,2230.54,And do you challenge here that the penalties here imposed would have that effect?
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2230.54,2231.874,"Oh, indeed I do."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.926,2237.961,"Because, what, the conduct had already ceased?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2237.961,2247.336,"Yes, because looking at this... deterrence to me implies, someone doesn't want to do something that's right, and you have to goad them into it."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.765,2269.931,"Well, you--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2278.621,2280.071,"--No, he didn't, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.071,2287.477,"Similarly, only by removing the economic benefit of noncompliance can a civil penalty ensure that a violator receive no economic advantage."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2287.477,2288.693,"You read that correctly, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.39,2314.96,"Well, did he agree the economic benefit was 1.1, or was that what your opponent argued?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2314.96,2316.51,"No, that's what he agreed."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.246,2318.146,"Oh, I see."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2318.146,2321.964,"--I think, three or four million we, of course, were lower, and he... we were, like, at $900,000."
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.563,2348.781,"Yes, but didn't he also anticipate counsel fees at the time he set the $400,000?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2348.781,2349.467,He did.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2350.033,2355.704,So he figured that more money was going to come out of their Treasury at some point as a result of the totality of their actions.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2355.704,2356.154,Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2377.534,2398.781,"But it doesn't follow from that that the penalty was not a deterrent, and it doesn't follow from that that in fact a... and it doesn't follow from historical practice, either, it seems to me, that the penalty cannot be a deterrent unless it is tied more specifically to specific action, because equity frequently depends upon the accrual of coercive penalties."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2420.044,2426.967,"Well, in equity, clearly you have, you know, an injunction."
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2453.617,2456.752,"This may get to a point that is semantic, and I'm not sure of the answer."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2494.111,2494.677,--I don't think it's fair.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2512.073,2515.275,And it was mandated because he found they had done certain bad things.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2515.275,2515.841,--He found violations.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.841,2516.175,Okay.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2516.175,2516.658,Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.658,2523.529,"Well, here there was an allegation of continuing violations."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2523.529,2524.547,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.547,2544.71,"And suppose the plaintiffs included people who lived along the river and who swam in it regularly and complained of the mercury discharges, and alleges violations that continued even after the filing of the complaint, amends the complaint, it's going on."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2561.32,2563.672,"I think that's what I'm saying, Your Honor, for this reason."
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2563.672,2566.474,Even if all those things that I've said are true.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2566.474,2566.908,Right.
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2576.931,2579.883,"Okay, so you raise the constitutional issue--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2579.883,2580.3,Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2580.3,2581.333,--by way of a defense.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2581.333,2582.919,I think as a statutory matter--
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.919,2589.923,"Now, did the Fourth Circuit rest on some grounds of mootness as opposed to standing?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2589.923,2590.673,--They did.
1999.98-822,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2590.673,2595.643,Do you think we need to send it back for a review of standing?
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2595.643,2613.438,"No, I don't, unless you over... of course, if you reverse the Fourth Circuit, then you can obviously take up the standing issue and the statutory issue raised in the briefs, or you could remand it."
1999.98-822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.571,2623.126,"I take it you agree that, as a general matter, penalties deter conduct."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2623.126,2629.13,"In a nonspecific, attenuated fashion that will vary from case to case, yes, sir, I do."
1999.98-822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2629.13,2632.566,"Well, but this is the basis of much of our criminal law and so forth."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2632.566,2633.682,It is.
1999.98-822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2634.768,2635.118,All right.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2638.986,2641.188,--We're going to assume--
1999.98-822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2641.188,2643.124,Let's make that assumption.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2643.124,2644.474,--That penalties deter conduct.
1999.98-822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.474,2648.676,"That an industry or business, that I'm concerned about this because I may have a penalty."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2655.848,2672.643,"I think under that hypothetical, if you could make the assumption, I would tend to agree that there's a much stronger case for allowing a private party to seek a penalty, because that private party's going to see a real benefit."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.938,2693.39,"May I ask this question, Mr. Cockrill."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2722.124,2748.624,"--Well, I guess I go back to this decision, to the Court's decision in Tull, where it pointed out that in the congressional history of the Clean Water Act the purposes of a penalty, while they include deterrence, the primary purpose is retribution, punishment, that there's also a restitutional purpose, whereas as I mentioned, an injunction is specifically designed to proscribe or regulate future conduct, and that's what I say when it's nonspecific."
1999.98-822,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.678,2754.378,--How could it be more specific?
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2769.105,2771.473,"--It may or may not, Your Honor."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.473,2791.903,"All right, well, if it may or may not... if it may or may not, why can't... why isn't Congress free to make a judgment that as a general matter there will be cases in which the fact that a plaintiff collects money for a past injury helps to deter this defendant from doing the same thing in the future?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2795.188,2797.207,I think Congress can make the judgment.
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.207,2814.502,"If Congress can make the judgment, then what is it about Article III that prevents them from saying that a person who's had injury in the past, and might have injury in the future, can bring a lawsuit to create in this case that specific deterrence?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2814.502,2824.541,"Justice Breyer, I think Congress can make the judgment, as they do in the legislative history of the Clean Water Act, that penalties will have a number of effects, including a general deterrent effect."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.797,2832.697,"No, they're not saying every."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2850.759,2858.079,"--Well, they give... under that hypothetical, of course, you're getting closer to penalties deterring in the great majority of cases."
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2922.519,2923.952,But that was an end argument.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2926.554,2940.647,"--Yes, ma'am, but I... but my point was that they have taken the position that penalties imposed in South Carolina will deter facilities in Kentucky and Texas that aren't really before the court to benefit--"
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.647,2951.436,"--But mainly they said, we don't have much of a record on this closing, we do have the permit still alive, and there's nothing that this Court can decide on that."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2965.696,2981.456,"--If they had appealed the denial of injunctive relief, I think the court, the Fourth Circuit could have heard the... it would not have been moot for that reason, for the statutory reason--"
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2981.456,2987.877,"That would have saved the case for mootness, even if the Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court that, all things considered, injunctive relief was unnecessary."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2987.877,2989.377,"--Yes, I think that's--"
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.377,2993.781,Then your rule is simply going to turn this into a kind of appellate pleadings game.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,2993.781,2994.298,--No.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.223,3021.866,"On your rule, the plaintiff is always going to feel that, because the plaintiff is going to know that in fact reliance on the penalties is going to get him nothing, because there won't be any penalty left, and he'll have to appeal the denial of the injunction, or he'll get nothing."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3021.866,3031.221,"--Well, I think as a matter of statutory construction under the Clean Water Act you must always have... in order to get penalties, they must be coupled with a request for injunctive relief."
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3033.073,3042.429,"And in your rule, in order to keep penalties, any penalty awarded must be accompanied by a continuing request for injunction at the appellate stage."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3042.429,3042.812,--Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3049.868,3050.752,But I... well--
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3050.752,3067.246,"--they made the decision not to do it, and that's all we're saying, is that once they made the decision to continue the litigation on appeal, seeking only a remedy that would not redress any injury that they had, that that, in effect, mooted the case--"
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3067.246,3067.879,"--Well, that turns--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3067.879,3068.496,--of the Steel Company.
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3068.496,3072.881,"--That may leave an interesting question, but it turns the case into rather a sport, I suppose."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3072.881,3074.75,I don't think it--
1999.98-822,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3074.75,3078.369,"Nobody's ever going to make this mistake again, if you win."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3078.369,3111.256,"--Well, except if they take up the injunction and the civil penalties, I think Steel Company... Justice Kennedy said under the Lyons case and the Casey case, and also Ashcroft v. Mattis, you look at each remedy individually and if there's not Article III jurisdiction for a particular remedy, it's not going to save that remedy to couple it with a remedy such as an injunction that does have an Article... that is grounded in Article III."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3111.256,3121.548,"No, but the problem is that if you admit that they have standing to get an injunction, because an injunction will stop repetition--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3121.548,3122.281,Yes.
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.281,3141.045,"--and if you admit that in the long run, the mind run of cases, Congress could believe that in the mind run of cases, collecting these kind of penalties will stop repetition, then you must think that they have standing and redressability to get this kind of penalty."
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3188.858,3189.758,"No, sir, I don't."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.758,3191.144,"Well, what is your position?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3191.144,3204.552,"My position is that, while Congress has noted a general deterrent effect, which I agree with, it's reasonable to presume that any penalty or sanction will have some unknown, general effect."
1999.98-822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.92,3208.704,Specific effect.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3208.704,3221.247,"--It... the specific effect will vary from person to person, and that's our position, that penalties are not specific enough, and you cannot predict the effect of a penalty on a--"
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.247,3236.506,"Well, but is your position, then, that penalties can never do the job, or that it's a case-by-case thing, that in some cases you can show that a penalty does have specific deterrence, or that since Congress has found that penalties are enough, that that would be true in all cases?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3236.506,3241.225,"--Well, I think in some cases, penalties will deter."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3253.818,3255.235,"What is your position on it, though?"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3255.235,3256.937,--My position on--
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.937,3265.943,What is... do you agree that there was sufficient deterrence for Article III purpose in this particular case?
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3265.943,3267.776,"--No, Your Honor, I don't."
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.987,3312.423,Mr. Cockrill--
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3312.423,3313.239,--that shows the problem.
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3313.239,3320.427,"--can I ask you, before you're finished with this other issue about counsel fees, there is a split in the circuits on the so-called catalyst theory--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3320.427,3321.029,There is.
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.029,3322.545,--which the Fourth Circuit rejected.
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3338.389,3347.328,"If you overrule the Fourth Circuit, and remand to the Fourth Circuit these other jurisdictional questions, I think it would be premature."
1999.98-822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3354.5,3364.456,"But handling it on remand, if you're a district court, you already know what your circuit court has said, that is, no catalyst theory, so it would leave this--"
1999.98-822,2,20682,donald_a_cockrill,,3364.456,3389.09,"--What I'm saying, Justice Ginsburg, is, on remand to the Fourth Circuit, to consider the standing argument based on lack of harm and the statutory jurisdiction argument based on the diligent prosecution, subject matter defense, if you send those back to the Fourth Circuit, then I think it would be premature for this Court to decide the attorney's fee issue."
1999.98-822,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.029,3477.564,"--Thank you, Mr. Cockrill."
1999.98-822,3,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3480.766,3495.359,"Your Honors, in both Tull and Romero-Barcelo this Court said that the Clean Water Act's penalties were intended to deter, as... and of course it had other purposes as well."
1999.98-822,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.378,3526.878,Well--
1999.98-822,3,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3526.878,3530.014,--of the determination by the district court after 10 days of trial.
1999.98-822,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3530.014,3543.774,"--Could the district court, Mr. Terris, simply say to defendant, I know you've hired a very expensive lawyer in this case, you're going to have to pay him a lot of money, so we don't need any more deterrence for your violation?"
1999.98-822,3,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3543.774,3563.087,"Well, Your Honor... Your Honor happens to have hit on one of the central grounds of our appeal to the court of appeals, which was that we take the position that the economic benefit has to be stripped from the violator without taking into account attorney's fees, particularly since the attorney's fees could not be known to the district court at the time."
1999.98-822,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3666.685,3667.385,"Thank you, Mr. Terris."
