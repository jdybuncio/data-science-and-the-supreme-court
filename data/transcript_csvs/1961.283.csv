1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,13.028,14.729,May it please the Court.
1961.283,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,14.729,17.131,Mr. Klonsky.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,17.131,31.923,"Your Honors, we are here concerned with the reversal by the Court of Appeals of the Jones Act seaman's verdict related to James Victor Salem who was a lookout able-bodied seaman aboard respondents S. S. United States."
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,126.726,128.314,It's called a radar tower.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,128.314,129.42,Yes Your Honor.
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,129.42,133.626,"A person who went up there, I think it is an ordinary old-fashioned lookout to me."
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,133.626,134.854,"That's right, sir."
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.854,137.351,It was just the radar -- there was no radar up there.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,137.351,139.643,There was radar on there too.
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,145.116,148.41,It wasn't up there in a crow's-nest so there's need (Voice Overlap) --
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,148.41,151.851,"No, no Sir, the radar scope, I would imagine, would be at the very top, but this --"
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,151.851,156.203,"No, the antenna part would be at the very top -- where you read the radar would be on the bridge of the ship."
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,156.203,156.896,Yes Your Honor.
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.896,157.67,Not up here.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,157.67,157.965,Right sir.
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.965,159.835,This is for an ordinary conventional lookout.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,159.835,160.63,Exactly.
1961.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,160.63,160.868,Yes.
1961.283,0,39670,robert_klonsky,,160.868,195.954,"And the manner in which they would get to this particular platform level would be to find an up and down ladder which is 15 inches wide or foot apart the rungs, and then they have to breach the open space, this manhole, by putting one foot behind them hoping to grab holes of a radar enclosure which is a rather bulky piece of a pertinence and then swing the other leg around and then walk towards the door which would lead into the bubble which was the radar -- which was the crow's-nest area in which also incidentally there was a telephone."
1961.283,1,44215,walter_x_connor,,1241.854,1244.267,May it please the Court.
1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,2941.164,2960.344,"To respond directly, Your Honors, to the last point, of course if there's anything seriously erroneous about an instruction although there was other evidence to support the verdict, it should go back, but the error contended here is one related to railing or other safety devices."
1961.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3218.444,3233.337,Do I understand you (Inaudible)
1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,3233.337,3234.767,"I think so, sir on any."
1961.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3234.767,3235.554,(Inaudible)
1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,3235.554,3237.064,"I think so, sir on any."

1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,3262.318,3263.192,"Not if you would please, Your Honor."
1961.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3288.854,3293.392,(Inaudible)
1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,3293.392,3298.379,"The kind of a ladder you would need, yes, I would think you'd need an expert now if the majority opinion stands."
1961.283,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3320.029,3322.727,(Inaudible)
1961.283,2,39670,robert_klonsky,,3322.727,3323.401,"Oh, I see, sir."
1961.283,3,44215,walter_x_connor,,3567.515,3584.022,"I have to say this to you, Your Honor, that these photographs which I have with my copies, Mr. Klonsky, I've given a copy during the -- before the trial and he introduced his evidence that he will say that the pictures I have and I didn't say that there was these copies of what I have previously given on what was on the trial."
1961.283,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3584.022,3589.847,"Well, someone has just put in my place what appeared to be the original exhibits (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.283,4,39670,robert_klonsky,,3589.847,3591.353,Then you have on the diagram â€“
1961.283,5,44215,walter_x_connor,,3591.353,3594.404,I have here the addition to that if Your Honor please.
1961.283,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3594.404,3595.66,(Inaudible)
1961.283,5,44215,walter_x_connor,,3595.66,3597.488,And I submit the drawing of this radar tower.
1961.283,6,39670,robert_klonsky,,3597.488,3599.835,That's in evidence.
1961.283,7,44215,walter_x_connor,,3599.835,3604.587,Which I'd be very glad to leave with the Court if somebody helps.
1961.283,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3624.959,3629.558,(Inaudible)
1961.283,7,44215,walter_x_connor,,3629.558,3630.406,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.283,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3633.41,3636.7,(Inaudible)
1961.283,7,44215,walter_x_connor,,3636.7,3642.406,"Thank you, Your Honor."
