1989.89-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.539,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-478, Maryland against Sandra Ann Craig."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,11.722,15.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,115.375,122.029,But each... each psychiatrist just testified about a single child or--
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,122.029,127.783,"No, Justice, there were five different experts."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.718,133.67,--But did they all testify about all the children?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,133.67,140.091,"--No, sir, only those children that they had under therapy for several weeks... several months."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.091,145.577,"So it sounds like there was only one... one expert for each child, is that it?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,145.577,148.096,"Well, in truth, one expert had three children."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,148.096,148.712,Okay.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,148.712,149.979,Another had two.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.648,153.081,All right.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,153.5,155.15,But no one had... had everyone.
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.15,183.785,"General Curran, I thought that the... the trial court finding was made in accordance with the language of the statute in Maryland, that the testimony of each of the children in a courtroom would result in the child suffering serious emotional distress, and that the children could not reasonably communicate in a courtroom?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,187.137,188.754,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.754,189.339,All right.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,200.379,222.561,"In truth, Justice O'Connor, if you will review the joint appendix, you will find that each of the five experts, when testifying about their respective child patient, testified with specificity that it was the presence of Mrs. Craig that they were seriously emotionally distressed by."
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.561,227.714,"Well, that may well be, but was that the finding of the trial court?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,227.714,234.452,"The trial court, Justice, as you rightly observe, did in fact track the exact words of the statute--"
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.452,234.818,Yes.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,234.818,241.206,--and found that the children testifying in the courtroom were deemed by May to be seriously emotionally distressed.
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.206,250.145,"There may well have been evidence in the record that would have permitted the trial judge to make a different finding, but it's not the finding the trial judge made, is it?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,250.145,252.747,"I conclude you are right, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.764,257.151,Does that mean we must affirm the judgment?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,257.151,260.019,"--No, but I... yes."
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.475,275.695,"Well, but you don't want us to make that finding, that the trial court should have made, do you?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,275.695,288.187,"--Well, I suggest to you, Justice O'Connor, that the trial judge conclusion was based solely on the testimony of the experts that talked solely about Mrs. Craig, and not about the courtroom."
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.187,292.491,"Now, the court below ordered a new trial."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,305.815,308.75,That is not necessary in our opinion.
1989.89-478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.962,367.805,"Was the defense objection simply to not having the child in the courtroom, or did the defense make the supplemental objection that it wanted the child at least present in the videotaped room... in the videotaping room?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,367.805,383.834,"The defense objection, which was continuing, I will tell you, Justice Kennedy, was that the children, out of the presence of the defendant, violated her Sixth Amendment right to confront the accuser."
1989.89-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.626,425.244,But this was presented live to the... in the courtroom?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,425.244,426.044,"--Yes, Justice."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.805,447.324,"General Curran, of course it wouldn't matter if it was live or not."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,450.759,451.645,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.645,452.711,"I mean, you can't tell when you're looking at it."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,456.113,456.397,That's correct.
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.397,459.049,So it could have been a movie taken two years ago.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,459.049,460.501,It could have been a videotape.
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.501,461.351,And so when you say live--
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,461.351,461.967,Our procedure--
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.967,463.536,--How was the camera set up?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,477.176,483.414,"--Justice, it was a picture of the child's face and upper body."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.603,507.296,"You couldn't tell what... what the prosecutor was eliciting from the child by much of the testimony in... in this case concerning the suggestibility of children, so as... that that... the suggestions can be made by all sorts of subtle manners in... in the person answering the question?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,509.332,511.449,The jury only observed on the monitors the child--
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.449,512.216,Just the face of the child?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,512.216,520.621,"--and heard, Justice Scalia, heard, of course, the questions from Mr. Kolodner or from Kate O'Donnell, the prosecutor who was present."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.621,526.109,So it isn't... how... what was the punishment for the offense here?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,526.109,528.059,The available punishment was 15 years.
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.795,543.155,"But for 15 years possible in jail, Mrs. Craig, just on the saying of one... you say they were not even all psychiatrists."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,543.605,546.94,"In truth, Justice, none were psychiatrists."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.94,547.357,--None--
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,547.357,556.978,"Dr. Sweeney was a licensed psychologist, who had worked for a period of time at the Johns Hopkins division of psychiatry, but she was indeed a psychologist."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.418,589.35,"--And on the basis of no more than the judgment of one licensed social worker, this woman could be sent to jail for 15 years on the basis of testimony of a child that she never even had the opportunity to be in the room with when the child said that testimony, to look at the child or if she wanted to personally conduct cross-examination to ask that child, you know, child, did I really do this to you."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,593.218,619.053,"With all due respect, Justice, the... the facts will also demonstrate that there was in addition to the child testifying as to what happened to her, there was the testimony of Dr. Charles Shubin, a child clinical pediatrician who documented physical findings of scarring in the private areas of these children, and that was not--"
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.053,620.071,I'm not talking about that evidence.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,634.062,651.757,"--It was based on the testimony before Judge Kane, the trial judge, that this expert witness who he qualified based on weeks... 20... the record will show in some cases 20 therapy visits and in another case 36 visits."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.639,677.739,"I understand that, and that's something of an emotional trauma."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,691.963,717.947,"--We're asking the Court to determine was the confrontation right that all of us have under the Sixth Amendment, the guarantee of a fair trial, was that satisfied by this procedure, bearing in mind the jury saw the child take the solemn oath, the jury saw and heard the extensive cross-examination, and the jury could assess the child's facial expressions and responses."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.703,727.769,And the presence of the defendant.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,727.769,728.236,And the--
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.236,739.525,"And the ability of counsel... if the defendant wanted to ask the questions herself to ask the child questions, or counsel to say, you know, there... there is Mrs. Craig, your mother, did she really do those things."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,744.579,754.803,"--Our position in that regard, Justice Scalia, is that there was this finding based on this testimony that the children were unavailable."
1989.89-478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.14,814.758,"General Curran, can I ask you a question about the Maryland statute?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,814.758,815.475,I'm sorry.
1989.89-478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.008,845.277,"If the, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her question, the test seems to be whether the child could testify in the courtroom rather than in the presence of the defendant, and if there were a finding that the child could not testify in the courtroom and had to testify in a... over TV, and if the defendant had represented herself rather than having counsel, would the proceeding have gone forward in the... by television with the defendant confronting the child and doing the cross-examination herself?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,845.277,847.563,"Our statute does not permit that, Your Honor."
1989.89-478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.419,858.371,I see.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,858.371,868.993,We... we can only use it when there's counsel involved and only use it when there has been a finding of functional unavailability.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.509,1006.698,"Well, which is it... which is it... which is it, just the trauma, or is it, as you suggested a minute ago, the functional unavailability?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1006.698,1015.654,"--It is the plain meaning, Justice White, of the term ""serious emotional distress"" such that one cannot reasonably communicate."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.34,1023.409,"Well, suppose there's plenty of trauma but you could not conclude that there was functional unavailability?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1023.409,1032.365,"Well, then... then, as again... and our statutes quite candidly permit the use of this for any person 17 and under."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.365,1050.727,"Well, what's so unusual... what's so bad about what the... your court of appeals did, it said that if you want to... if you want to avoid having the child testify in the courtroom, you ought to... you ought to test it out... test them out ahead of time."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1050.727,1051.361,Like a dry run.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.361,1052.227,"Well, yeah."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1057.965,1060.599,"But, Your Honor, if... if we are correct--"
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.599,1076.461,"And all you talked about is that what you're trying to avoid would... would be... would happen in the dry run, but you're... you're really after more than just avoiding trauma."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1076.461,1080.346,--We don't want to cause the serious emotional distress.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.896,1082.282,All right.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1087.484,1099.558,"--Well, then, if... if they're severe... if the experts say there will be serious emotional distress but they will not... they still will be able to reasonably communicate, well, then, they have to, sadly, go in court."
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.743,1105.111,"Well, why not... why not test that out ahead of time?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1105.111,1116.253,--Because we think it would be illogical if we're trying to protect children from this serious emotional distress to make them incur the very thing we're trying to protect them from.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.538,1135.583,"I know, but you don't... you don't want to... you just seem to me to concede that... that severe emotional distress would not be enough to excuse the... to excuse them from testifying in the courtroom."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1135.583,1143.486,"Serious... well, our statute, in all candor, Justice White, requires the finding of serious emotional distress such that--"
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.486,1143.953,Exactly.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1143.953,1145.272,--they cannot reasonably communicate.
1989.89-478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.272,1145.805,Exactly.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1150.926,1152.459,"That would be correct, Justice."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.93,1164.936,Emotional distress actually has nothing to do with it except that that's the reason for the functional disability.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1186.099,1188.717,"That is not a Maryland statute, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.601,1191.836,--Emotional distress is not the criterion.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1194.069,1199.573,"--The criteria, is there a compelling public policy?"
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1265.467,1288.065,"Well, General Curran, I suppose it's possible that a rape victim, as Justice Scalia mentions, or even a victim of some Mafia-type crime, and an adult, could be so terrified to testify that it would be... perhaps the same finding could be made."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1293.785,1295.737,"--Justice O'Connor, we don't--"
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1295.737,1298.456,Or an elderly crime victim.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1298.456,1300.891,--Or perhaps a retarded person.
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1309.83,1319.519,I'm just asking you whether you think the confrontation clause would preclude a state rule to protect such adult witnesses?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1319.519,1345.336,"--I believe the state, Maryland in our child case by our statute, or any other state who ever attempts to have something other than the preferable face to face, must demonstrate by testimony, reliability, and they must demonstrate the unavailability of that particular person, and if they're unavailable--"
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1345.336,1346.519,The functional--
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1346.519,1347.636,--Functional unavailability--
1989.89-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1347.636,1348.371,--unavailable?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1348.371,1354.775,"--in our case, or functionally unavailability in the... in the case of the rape victim or the elderly person."
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1396.269,1409.577,"Mr. Attorney General, does your test... your evidence from these experts, their testimony, did they say that it was impossible for this child to testify?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1411.529,1416.95,"I... Justice, I don't recall the word ""impossible""."
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1417.533,1421.152,"Well, weren't you obliged to go that far--"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1421.152,1421.754,--They--
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1421.754,1424.871,--before you put somebody in jail for 15 years?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1424.871,1425.838,--Well--
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.838,1429.257,You talk about the trauma for the child.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1433.109,1434.644,"--I understand, Justice."
1989.89-478,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1434.644,1442.417,But of course a child scarred for life is a lot longer than 15 years.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1442.417,1445.869,"I agree, Justice."
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1469.15,1473.286,But they never made any effort to find out.
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1473.286,1481.375,They never preliminarily put them in a room with the defendant and physically saw that they would decompensate.
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.925,1484.494,"Do you need the word ""preliminarily"" in there?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1485.61,1486.696,"No sir, they did not."
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.346,1488.662,"So you don't need the word ""preliminarily""."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1488.662,1491.314,"--Well, by that... I'm sorry, Justice."
1989.89-478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.24,1513.763,What would you do with an adult with a mental age of five?
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1513.763,1520.667,"--Well, that's a very compelling scenario, and it's not, of course, covered by our particular case."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.9,1550.352,"Well, but we're not looking for truth at any cost."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1570.866,1585.776,"--Yes, Justice, but we are permitting hearsay to come in if it is firmly rooted in our jurisprudence or if you can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the trier of the fact that there is a source of truthfulness, and we believe--"
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.776,1602.154,"--But isn't the best way for the trier of fact to look at the witness and look at the witness' reaction to the questions and the questioner's attitudes, the expressions of the questioners, and to see the way the witness interacts with the defendant that is supposed to have done this harm to the witness?"
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1605.956,1617.831,"--I concede see that is the most effective way, and I concede that's the preferable, but for the four or five-year-old child who simply can't do that."
1989.89-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1620.116,1624.418,"It's still the most effective if the child in fact weighs it and says, hi, mommy."
1989.89-478,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1648.283,1673.917,"--No, Justice, what we... we want the child to be able to tell her story and for the jury to hear the truth of what happened, and if the only way she can do that is by being permitted in a narrow sense just to be in another room, under oath, cross-examination and the jury sees her, that's far preferable than permitting in some hearsay testimony where there is none of those."
1989.89-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.119,1678.737,"Very well, General Curran."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1686.225,1692.629,"Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.795,1778.501,"Mr. Murphy, what... what do you think the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause requires in a case like this where you've got small children as witnesses?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1778.501,1782.055,It depends on what the beginning assumption is for the process.
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.055,1784.841,"Well, I'm asking you what you think our law requires."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1784.841,1791.91,"If the defendant is innocent, for example, it requires the absolute face-to-face confrontation to help bring that out."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.91,1802.552,"Well... where we're talking about a confrontation clause requirement in the context of a trial where the defendant is, of course, attended by the presumption of innocence."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1808.104,1812.074,"Number one, the proximity of the witness to the defendant."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.693,1818.978,You mean proximity in the courtroom?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1818.978,1819.828,Yes.
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.334,1828.518,Can that never be dispensed with?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1828.518,1829.786,"I don't believe so, no."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.786,1833.237,"So you don't agree, then, with the Maryland Court of Appeals in this case?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1833.237,1834.987,"No, I don't, not that part of what they said."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.808,1860.655,"Your... your position is that if one of these child witnesses has been put through the procedure stated by the Maryland Court of Appeals and is given a trial run in the presence of the defendant, the witness is functionally unable to testify, that's... that's the end of the case, that that witness will not be heard from?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1860.655,1861.105,--Your Honor--
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.105,1861.924,Is that your position?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1861.924,1864.793,"--Yes, it is, and I will explain why."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.033,1937.555,"Well, were any objections made by the defense counsel to any action by the prosecutor when the witness was questioned?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1950.149,1952.082,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe any such objections were made."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.082,1952.399,No.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1952.399,1962.806,"But on the other hand, it would not have been counsel's right to object if the child looked at the prosecutor subtlely or if the prosecutor--"
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.806,1974.097,"Well, the counsel could surely object if the prosecutor were by conduct trying to indicate to the child how the child should respond."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,1974.097,1984.12,"--On the other hand, though, Your Honor, if the child were reacting to the accused's presence, that full reaction would be present in front of the fact-finder."
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.699,2008.318,Did the child see the judge before the videotaping began?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2008.318,2010.437,The record is not clear about that.
1989.89-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.749,2030.867,Let me just clarify one thing.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2034.653,2036.17,Absolutely not.
1989.89-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.17,2041.056,So the judge wouldn't be able to observe what exactly or how the prosecutor was behaving?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2041.056,2047.812,"That is correct, nor would the jury, nor would co-counsel sitting next to Ms. Craig, nor would Ms. Craig."
1989.89-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.812,2053.28,How... how under that procedure would the judge rule on an objection such as Justice O'Connor has suggested?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2057.418,2063.487,"That's an... that's an excellent question, Your Honor, because he would not be able to rule."
1989.89-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.138,2066.024,Say the prosecutor denied that he did it.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2067.19,2067.757,That's right.
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.199,2090.639,Were there other people in the court... in... in the room with the child when she testified who can themselves testify if it became necessary--
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2090.639,2091.322,"In this case, no."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.322,2098.078,"--because this is certainly off on a strange tack now that's far removed from the issue here, isn't it?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2098.078,2110.219,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's integrally related to the issue, and that is whether or not any balancing, in fact, occurred when this child was put in a separate room away from the court, away from the jury, away from the defendant."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.219,2131.816,"Well, assuming that a trial court is able to make a specific, a case-specific finding that the child witness cannot testify in the presence of the defendant, how is the truth-seeking function impeded there?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2131.816,2147.928,"If the defendant is innocent and the presence of the child could have... or rather, the presence of the defendant before the child could have provoked the kind of response consistent with innocence, the truth-seeking function of the trial has been ruined."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.296,2185.184,"Well, if the evidence, for example, shows that the child witness' testimony might be more reliable in the absence of the defendant's immediate presence and there is, after all, the right of cross-examination, which we have always thought was crucial in terms of reaching the truth, the witness is still under oath, the jury and the defendant still see the witness in a very direct way on the screen."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2196.159,2202.328,"If I can make an analogy, Justice O'Connor, we're about to have exploratory surgery."
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2232.848,2248.293,"Well, you're proceeding on the assumption that veracity, credibility is always better tested with the child witness when that child witness is in a big courtroom facing the defendant and the judge."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2277.194,2277.877,If that were so--
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2277.877,2279.579,Have there been any studies on that?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2279.579,2285.315,--There have been conflicting studies about the impact of child testimony.
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2326.209,2344.921,"Well, of course, you're asking us to make an assumption that in all or most cases the truth-seeking function is better served... and I'm just pointing out that I... I don't believe there is... that's necessarily borne out by modern scholarship with respect to videotape."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2344.921,2345.421,--Well--
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.421,2348.623,I agree that the thrust of the jurisprudence in on your side.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2348.623,2363.216,"--The... the question remains, then, are we experimenting at the expense of Ms. Craig's rights, given that there is no authority in support of the experiment, and if we were to find authority later which said it was a bad experiment, what happens to Mrs. Craig?"
1989.89-478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.998,2390.217,"Well, of course, again, there's an assumption that trauma will bring out... bring out the truth."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2398.989,2405.578,"Your Honor, I believe we can look at 200 years of jurisprudence where, on occasion, things like that have happened."
1989.89-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.492,2468.402,"Mr. Murphy, we don't really know that even adults appear to testify... that the truth process is served by having adults testify in... in front of black robes, as you put it."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2493.184,2493.636,I agree.
1989.89-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.636,2495.286,"Just that it sometimes does it, I thought."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2497.338,2509.229,"My mother, who was present, and my father who is a member of this Court who argued here in 1952, have both had the experience with me, of frightening me into the truth, and I am sure that they would not dispense with that."
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.607,2530.659,You're familiar with the case that's going to follow yours?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2530.659,2531.325,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.325,2532.427,Idaho against Wright?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2532.427,2533.994,Yes.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.994,2539.515,"Which would you prefer, the Maryland procedure or the Idaho procedure?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2539.515,2542.117,That's asking me whether I prefer the devil or the deep blue sea.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.117,2542.967,Exactly right.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2549.437,2551.223,Which kind of poison would I ingest?
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.223,2552.606,"Exactly, exactly."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2552.606,2555.008,"Well, I'd reject them both, Your Honor, and that's--"
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.008,2555.458,I know.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2555.458,2556.61,--the only fair answer I could give you.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.593,2558.277,I know.
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2569.2,2572.569,"Yes, I'd prefer the slower-acting poison to that quick fix."
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.569,2573.921,"Exactly, exactly, exactly."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2573.921,2579.992,"And, Your Honor, I think much of that, although said somewhat in jest, is true."
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.992,2587.746,"Functional, but... I... I take it that you... you don't think there's room for much hearsay at all in a criminal trial."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2587.746,2605.691,"No, I think the firmly rooted historically acceptable exceptions ought to stay with us because they deal with discrete instances of reliability, not the testimony of a basically unreliable child... and, by the way, the younger the child, the more the child needs to be protected."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.691,2612.546,"Well, those... those... those instances of historical exceptions to the hearsay rule didn't devolve all at one time."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2623.604,2627.056,"Well, I'm afraid of experimental justice, and--"
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.056,2633.46,"Well, the hearsay... the hearsay rule in its evolution over the centuries was experimental."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2633.46,2635.662,--At... at a great cost to innocent people.
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.662,2640.447,"Well, but are you saying that the entire rules of evidence should be frozen as of 1787?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2640.447,2642.166,"Oh, not at all."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.908,2673.018,"Well, but your... your... your position is that these kind of crimes that are involved here simply in many cases will not be prosecuted because the rules of evidence will be too strict to ever allow the witnesses who know most about the thing to tell their version to the jury."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2673.018,2684.893,"On the other hand, many cases will not be prosecuted because the prospect of testifying face to face falsely against an accused will be too much for a child witness or an adult to bear."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.325,2736.61,But you think Thomas Jefferson was an expert on trial procedure?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2736.61,2738.027,"Well, let me pick a better one."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2779.287,2792.781,"Mr. Murphy, it sounds to me like you don't defend the judgment of the Maryland court, that you would never permit under any finding the procedure that Maryland has devised for youths?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2792.781,2794.347,"Your Honor, you're right."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2794.347,2796.733,So you're not defending the judgment below?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2796.733,2800.451,I am defending three-quarters of the judgment below.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.931,2822.633,"Well, the Maryland court would prevent... would permit a new trial?"
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2822.633,2823.25,Yes.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.685,2834.024,Well... but would permit... would permit a... would permit a trial with these witnesses if the procedure that the court specified was followed?
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2834.024,2835.124,I do not support that.
1989.89-478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.124,2841.444,"I know you don't, but the... but, of course, you didn't cross... you didn't cross there."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2841.444,2842.344,"That... that... that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2913.124,2915.54,You argued that--
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2919.528,2921.261,--Only that part of the judgment which we--
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.261,2926.348,"Well, you... you have to cross-appeal to... to obtain that result."
1989.89-478,1,45540,william_h_murphy_jr,,2929.05,2932.169,"--That is correct, Judge."
1989.89-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.989,2938.072,"Thank you, Mr. Murphy."
1989.89-478,2,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,2943.393,2946.261,"I would like to respond, if I might, to Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-478,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2965.907,2966.925,Was that the same day?
