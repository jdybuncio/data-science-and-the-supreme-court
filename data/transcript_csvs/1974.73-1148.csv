1974.73-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.262,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1148, DeCoteau against the District Court."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,51.035,54.194,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.761,204.121,"Mr. Hirsch enlighten me, why is that particularly relevant?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,212.398,215.545,"Well, this case never reached the point of adoption."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.944,241.423,"I would still ask, why is the place where the acts took place pertinent?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,241.423,256.478,"Well, it's pertinent in terms of whether we are talking here about state jurisdiction over the Indian mother and her two children or whether we are talking about exclusive tribal jurisdiction."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,256.478,259.987,"Incidentally, does the record show where she was domiciled?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,259.987,263.557,The record does not show where she was domiciled.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.792,363.252,"Mr. Hirsch, isn't the district court, the court of general jurisdiction in the South Dakota state court system?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,363.252,369.482,The district court is the court of jurisdiction in family matters.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.487,378.159,And was there an appeal from the district court to the circuit court?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,378.159,388.6,"I believe that it is possible to appeal from the district court to the circuit court, but the statutes also allow in some instances for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court."
1974.73-1148,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,649.859,652.497,"That's a pretty strong language, isn't it?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,652.497,665.099,"It is, Your Honor, but I think that we have to understand what the rest of that section says and read that in context and I'm going to do that in a second."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.09,764.695,"Well, where are you reading from?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,767.696,768.313,I'm reading form the Mattz decision--
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,768.313,769.87,In the beginning--
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,769.87,771.331,--at page 496.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.331,772.369,"Oh, you're reading from the --"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,772.369,776.581,From the actual decision of the court.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.651,779.97,"Well, in Mattz?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,779.97,782.195,I'm reading the Mattz decision of this court--
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.195,782.668,I see.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,782.668,783.619,--a quote from the Mattz decision.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.619,785.641,I thought you're reading from a part of page 26.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,785.641,786.844,"No, I'm not."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.844,790.054,Okay.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,790.054,797.608,"The court said that when all the lands had been alloted and the trust expired, the reservation could then be abolished."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.679,910.919,"Mr. Hirsch, does the record indicate the number of square miles that are involved in this claim reservation?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,910.919,921.142,"The record of the case itself, I don't believe does unless Exhibit number 1 might refer to it."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.506,952.27,Same as this or not?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,952.27,952.315,"No, it's not."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.315,960.182,"This was given to us on a different case, but it is United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian land areas general."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,960.182,962.811,"Right, that map is a map of the United States."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.811,963.531,Right.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,963.531,966.919,And imprinted on the map are the Indian land areas.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.919,967.052,Correct.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,967.052,979.743,"The Exhibit number 1 is a map only of the triangular section, known as the Lake Traverse Reservation and that's a map that the BIA uses today."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.743,985.75,Does the record indicate the number of the Indians living in the area now or the number of non-Indians living in the area now?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,985.75,987.112,"No, it doesn't."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.449,989.619,"We will find, would you, would you--"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,989.619,997.087,"Yeah, the reservation contains 918,000 acres approximately, it's 918,300."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.087,998.974,"It's 918,300, isn't it?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,998.974,1000.871,"That's right, that's right."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.023,1006.056,Was that roughly a 150 sq. miles?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1006.056,1017.551,"It's a 120 miles from north to south and it's from -- at the widest point from east to west, it's about 40 miles, I believe."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.336,1029.092,In the total population?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1029.092,1035.756,"Of the reservation area, Indian and non-Indian, it's approximately 30,000."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1035.756,1036.569,Or would be--
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1036.569,1038.116,-- a little less.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.116,1045.31,"Would the 27,000 a difference, if you prevail here be subject to tribal jurisdiction?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1045.31,1046.949,"No, not at all."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.804,1056.978,Only enrolled ones --
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1056.978,1057.227,That's correct.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.227,1060.711,"That must be, that must follow from the 1891 Act."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1065.481,1068.78,That's right.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.78,1078.015,"If the reservation hasn't been disturbed in any way, the tribe's authority would extend everybody in this direction."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1078.015,1080.845,The tribe's authority would extend to all the Indians --
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.845,1082.952,--and everybody else.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1082.952,1085.254,If the reservation had not been disturbed in anyway.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.254,1089.622,Yes.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1089.622,1091.075,Well--
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.075,1093.569,Or wouldn't it?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1093.569,1098.971,The issue of whether or not the tribe has jurisdiction over non-Indians on--
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.971,1099.677,On reservation.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1099.677,1108.554,"Let's say, generally, an Indian country, is an issue that is presently being litigated in several courts and is not really clear."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.812,1114.791,I'll ask this way.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1128.448,1130.063,What we are maintaining here is that --
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.063,1147.198,"I know what you're maintaining, I know you're maintaining, if you've had authority over Indians, did the 1891 Act changed the tribe's authority in anyway over the land and those living on it within the area of the reservation that you claim to be--"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1147.198,1150.575,"I don't believe it did, I don't believe it did."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.845,1171.07,"Well then, under Williams against Lee, certainly, the Indian authorities would have a great deal of authority over non-Indians within the reservation area, wouldn't they?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1171.07,1184.021,"Williams against Lee was a case, as I recall, where a non-Indian was suing an Indian for recovery of money that was owed for purchases at a store on the Navajo Reservation."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.021,1185.966,And they said he couldn't sue in the state court.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1185.966,1192.662,They said he couldn't sue in the state court -- because there was an Indian defendant in the case.
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.662,1201.412,"Well, would this be true here too that from now on, a non-Indian couldn't sue in the South Dakota district court if he lived within this reservation area?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1201.412,1218.734,"If non-Indians live within the reservation and they have a civil action of the nature as was dealt with by this court in Williams against Lee yes, and they would have to sue in the Tribal Court and there is a Tribal Court that has been exercising that jurisdiction since August of 1972."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.734,1222.987,"And this reservation, it covers parts of five different counties in South Dakota."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1222.987,1225.104,That's correct.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.217,1256.27,You concede or suppose you call it the section of -- but you think the fact is that here the tribe on this land would have no authority over non-Indian?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1256.27,1259.147,"No, I am not saying that at all, I am saying that it's --"
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.147,1260.123,On the ceded land?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1260.123,1271.639,"That on the ceded lands, it's definitely clear, in terms of our position here today, it's definitely clear, that the tribe has complete civil jurisdiction over non-Indians."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.318,1291.527,"Your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question upon though was that yes, this case does involve all those people, all those non-Indians for the said reservation."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1291.527,1310.133,"But not necessarily to the all inclusive extent to what Mr. Justice Blackmun was perhaps getting to, and that is that where the action is between two non-Indians then the tribe's jurisdiction --"
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.133,1324.293,"What's the authority of the state over a non-Indian, living on a ceded land, what about that state's criminal law?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1324.293,1325.686,The state's--
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.686,1331.451,Or it's Civil Law or Child Neglect law with respect to a non-Indian in a ceded country.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.451,1335.914,"Let's take this case if these have been non-Indians, in other words."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1335.914,1340.145,If he is a non-Indian the State Law applies to him on the reservation.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.145,1348.964,Why if this is reservation?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1348.964,1370.074,The only way in which the tribe holds the reservation is to have jurisdiction over its own membership on the reservation and to have jurisdiction over non-Indians where the actions of non-Indians affect essential tribal relations.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.621,1373.231,Beg your pardon.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1373.231,1378.56,I said that's what this court said in Williams against Lee.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1378.56,1394.328,"Williams against Lee said the -- if I have the case in mind, promptly said that the State Courts did not have jurisdiction and that was the case where non-Indian plaintiff was suing an Indian defendant, right?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1394.328,1397.262,"A non-Indian plaintiff was suing an Indian defendant, that's correct."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1397.262,1399.061,"So, the State Courts does not have jurisdiction?"
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1399.061,1403.189,"That's right, they had to go to Tribal Court."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1403.189,1405.294,But there's a--
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1405.294,1411.507,"And I maintain the same situation would exist here, if that situation occurred on this reservation, on the ceded land."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.507,1424.476,"And the question is, as put by my brother White, what if in this very case, these people had been non-Indians but this mother had been a non-Indian and the children would have been non-Indians and the acts had occurred just as they did occur."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.873,1434.661,This isn't a 280 law state?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1434.661,1435.327,"No, it's not."
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.327,1435.595,"No, it's not."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1435.595,1436.227,No it's not.
1974.73-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.453,1451.016,They have it if it's in the reservation.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1451.016,1463.761,"The treaty that established this reservation, specifically says in Article X, that the Chiefs and the headman of the tribe can make rules and regulations for the governance of its own membership, within the boundaries of the reservation."
1974.73-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.152,1473.333,Was that any difference than the Williams against Lee.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1483.774,1506.157,"No, the situation there is that there was an Indian defendant and the law as it's come down, Federal Indian Law does not give a tribe jurisdiction in a case where both parties are non-Indians, but where one of the parties is an Indian, then you have a different situation."
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1508.966,1511.906,But what case particularly says that?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1511.906,1513.514,"Well, you have --"
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.514,1514.722,For any case?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1514.722,1515.285,Okay.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1519.038,1520.734,Which held that the State did not have jurisdiction?
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1520.734,1523.863,That the State does not have jurisdiction because there was an Indian defendant.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.863,1543.102,"Yes, now I am interested in any case or cases, do you know -- let’s say that the State does have jurisdiction over people living on an Indian Reservation."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1543.102,1569.977,"In the cases of Draper and McBratney, there were criminal cases where non-Indians were involved and the area of criminal jurisdiction is defined by 18 U.S.C. 1151 and that's the case that you have next in feather, where the Major Crimes Act applies to --"
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1569.977,1570.947,That's federal criminal jurisdiction.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1570.947,1571.721,That's right.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.721,1575.737,Where I am talking about the State.
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1589.938,1597.384,"For a State to get jurisdiction, be it civil or criminal, over Indians on an Indian Reservation --"
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.384,1598.097,"No, no."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1616.855,1628.737,I think that the answer is that a state has jurisdiction over all the people within the state except as Congress otherwise states.
1974.73-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1648.183,1663.117,"I think the questions from the Bench indicate that the significance of this case may go much further, that's the point of the question, as I understood."
1974.73-1148,0,17713,bertram_e_hirsch,,1663.117,1674.975,"Well, to be honest, I am not -- this is a very developing area of law and I am not exactly sure in what direction it’s going to go in the next few years."
1974.73-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.414,1892.413,"Very well, Mr. Hirsch."
1974.73-1148,1,44425,william_f_day_jr,,1894.571,1901.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.067,1958.783,"It has been ceded Mr. Day, wouldn't you have an extraordinarily difficult problem of administering a law civil or criminal, if it would be on a patchwork basis of everything that's quite there being under the jurisdiction of South Dakota and everything that's read being under the jurisdiction of the tribe?"
1974.73-1148,1,44425,william_f_day_jr,,1958.783,1961.263,"No sir, not that difficult."
1974.73-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.364,1968.556,I would be in interested in knowing some time when the court argument is going on --
1974.73-1148,1,44425,william_f_day_jr,,1968.556,1969.259,Truly.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4237.219,4239.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4314.349,4315.918,Is that civil as well as criminal?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4315.918,4317.544,Civil as well as criminal.
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4317.544,4319.513,Cake and Eagen?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4319.513,4321.846,Irrespective of where they live within the --
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4321.846,4324.99,But if the transaction is within the Indians they are going to --
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4324.99,4340.852,"Correct, if the transaction is with an Indian or it affects the vital interest of the tribe, they are going to be subject to Federal Law the exact extent of that is the kind of thing that's still debated and it was before even in a case such as the Mazurie case, that's under advisement."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4340.852,4342.968,And maybe debated eventually in this case.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4342.968,4346.089,And may eventually be debated here.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4461.084,4463.998,"Yes, but we do have the language obsession."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4463.998,4474.274,"You do have language obsession that is correct, but there is no specific area ceded, what ceded is what is not allotted."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4474.274,4480.412,"As a matter of fact, ceded is the public domain."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4480.412,4482.0,I don't know what you mean by that.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4482.0,4486.556,Well what happened that after they ceded the property?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4486.556,4490.685,After the property was ceded the government sold that land under the--
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4490.685,4493.085,Was it in public domain?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4493.085,4495.603,"Well, only in the exact same sense that in--"
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4495.603,4502.626,It was handled as a part of a public domain by the same system there is a public domain which--
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4502.626,4515.321,"But that -- what I was going to say and I will try to get this, I think I want to do better to bring it down in historical perspective, but the Indians were paid for the land, how were they paid for it?"
1974.73-1148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4586.885,4599.124,Would it be fair to say that the United States in those transactions was acting as the broker for the Indians to announce publicly that settlers could come in and buy it for $2.50 half an acre?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4599.124,4614.879,"It's exactly so and we quote in our brief, where one of the senators objected to the session idea, to the fact that the government would pay the money immediately, and one of the other senators explained to him says, “This doesn't mean anything, because this is just a bookkeeping transaction in the treasury."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4701.68,4711.301,Whether it impacted anything that the session had followed by the sale for homesteading or the settlement for homesteading?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4716.997,4717.104,Of the State?
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4717.104,4717.954,"The state things, yeah."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4717.954,4720.206,"None, none."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4738.923,4747.433,"Yes, but you would apparently think the State has civil and criminal jurisdiction over Non-Indians?"
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4747.433,4748.122,Clearly.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4748.122,4755.578,How about the state's Trespass Law?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4755.578,4763.269,"The States Trespass Law would clearly apply to Non-Indians, but that would be, that the extent that it's applied --"
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4763.269,4776.581,"How about the owner of the deeded land, the ceded land, he now has a fee simple title to it, and he wants to keep people off of his land, and he does it in the name of the State's Trespass Law."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4781.525,4785.861,I don't think he could keep an Indian from --
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4785.861,4788.888,Really?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4788.888,4791.375,It seems to me that inside an Indian reservation --
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4791.375,4798.568,"Well, let me talk to you about a Non-Indian, can you keep a Non-Indian off in the name of the State's Trespass Law."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4798.568,4799.774,Clearly yes.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4799.774,4803.514,So the State's Law does apply there.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4803.514,4806.82,"What I am saying is, that in a transaction between an Indian and a non-Indian --"
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4806.82,4820.114,"I didn't ask you about transaction Mr. Sachse, I asked you about the States Trespass law -- does the State Trespass Law apply to that land?"
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4820.114,4824.877,"It applies to that land as to non-Indians, but not as to Indians."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4832.902,4839.785,"So the State Sovereignty just doesn't apply to that land, no matter whom it is owned by as far as keeping an Indian off of this."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4841.432,4855.864,"I think that's correct, that would be under Federal Law or under Tribal Law if it's a matter of effecting an Indian inside Indian reservation."
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4987.676,4990.076,That's been the situation for good many years.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4990.076,4991.742,That's right.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4991.742,4994.172,Hasn't been a great deal for a couple of others.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4994.594,4995.861,"Well, I think there has."
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5010.182,5011.402,What is the State's job?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5017.951,5025.959,The State's responsibility in an Indian reservation is as to non-Indians to maintain law and order in matters between non-Indians.
1974.73-1148,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5047.297,5049.987,Does the non-Indians ever get in conflict with an Indian?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5049.987,5057.407,"Yes, and when that happens, that's federal jurisdiction under 18 USC 1151 and it makes a good deal of sense that federal--"
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5057.407,5060.834,Is that generally or that's true if it's on a reservation?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5060.834,5062.777,If it's on a reservation.
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5062.777,5064.243,But not otherwise?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5064.243,5071.176,If it's off reservation it would not -- that's right the State jurisdiction.
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5071.176,5072.246,In a civil dispute?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5072.246,5074.214,"No, excuse me that's inaccurate."
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5080.467,5086.143,"Yes, if any of patented land is Indian country, by statutory definition, is that correct?"
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5086.143,5086.585,That's right.
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5086.585,5090.232,"In a civil dispute under Williams against Lee, isn't a federal question?"
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5093.355,5106.098,"That's correct, that within an Indian reservation, in a matter affecting Indians, the original jurisdiction, the root of the jurisdiction was tribal jurisdiction."
1974.73-1148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5126.052,5144.034,"Laying aside the major crimes question, and you had a very simple statement that I understood throughly, for a moment or two there, when you said it doesn't depend on geography or plats, it depends on the racial origin."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5151.585,5179.914,"That is true in Indian country but if you -- Indian country's any land inside the reservation, if this court were to hold that this reservation had been abolished by the 1891 Act, which I think would be a very restrictive and artificial interpretation of what Court has done and that's in Seymour versus Superintendent, and I think would also undercut 18 USC 1151 seriously at least for this reservation."
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5179.914,5181.651,So we had -- if the court should hold that?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5181.651,5193.616,"If the Court should hold that, then each one of these red spots is a little island of federal and tribal jurisdiction, and we are not in a time now, when these --"
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5193.616,5195.391,Isn't it as my brother White suggested?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5195.391,5204.942,"The way it's been is that everyone has ignored both the Indian, and Federal rights there, and I don't want to testify."
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5216.158,5240.597,"On the other hand, if the court should decide that statute, the session statute didn't amount to a conveyance, then the result would be, that the State would no longer have any power to enforce its laws in any of these several counties, if any Indian was involved."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5240.597,5255.954,"That's correct, it would be a federal question or as in any other Indian reservation, and that wherever it occurred, and this is something that Congress has decided as a proper way for the federal government to exercise its--"
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5255.954,5257.112,If this is an Indian reservation.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5257.112,5266.009,"Yes and whether this one is or not it will be the same situation you are describing in other reservations of the state, clearly are reservations."
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5278.049,5292.644,"Well, I suppose the vast proportion of the -- this is something like what 27,000 non-Indians and few 3,000 plus Indians tracked in this Lake Traverse area."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5292.644,5305.336,"That's correct, but we are not trying to subject to the non-Indians to Federal or Indian jurisdiction except to extent needed to fulfill the trust response --"
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5305.336,5310.898,Which means that whenever they are involved with an Indian the state does not have any Jurisdiction.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5310.898,5311.824,That's correct.
1974.73-1148,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5311.824,5316.462,"With respect to its civil, criminal, or family, or status law."
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5316.462,5317.712,That's right.
1974.73-1148,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5317.712,5327.921,If it has to be tried --
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5327.921,5330.722,"I haven't seen it, I have heard that, that's so."
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5340.121,5344.794,How do we know that the tribe doesn't have authority to reach non-Indians?
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5344.794,5349.521,"Well, the McBratney case and the Draper case and criminal matters."
1974.73-1148,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5349.521,5356.312,McBratney says is that the State has a right to try a White man for a crime that took place on an Indian reservation.
1974.73-1148,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,5362.111,5384.599,"Well, I suppose I just have to answer that this has been at least tacit holding of this court and our assumption of the court in number of cases, I refer you to Cake and Eagen where Justice Frankfurter tried to lay out the limits on tribal jurisdiction."
1974.73-1148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5404.358,5407.501,You are on our time for a minute or a two here.
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5418.687,5423.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the court please."
1974.73-1148,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5445.832,5447.818,The question was there is --
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5447.818,5459.327,"Yes, I don't think there is any part or any confusion even by the State that there is a reservation on part of this land."
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5470.428,5472.074,They are conceding it is Indian country.
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5472.074,5473.878,"It is Indian country, it is--"
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5473.878,5475.656,But not a reservation.
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5475.656,5488.479,"But, that the federal law does apply, that the law for the tribe applies on minor crimes, and let's come back to 1151 that we adhere on that thing."
1974.73-1148,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5528.889,5533.148,You are anxious to have your clients sentenced under the Major Crimes Act?
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5533.148,5534.519,That is true Your Honor.
1974.73-1148,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5558.514,5564.106,Was there anything in the record in this case that would indicate that the State proceeded unfairly against --
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5564.106,5570.033,"No, and I am not trying to allege that the State did proceed unfairly."
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5620.59,5623.764,"Now, how did you do that under the Eight Circuit opinion?"
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5623.764,5624.96,"Yes, under the Feather case."
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5626.396,5627.654,After the Feather case was decided --
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5627.654,5631.37,After the Feather case came out via the State Circuit Court --
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5631.37,5632.487,Then reservation --
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5632.487,5636.475,Right and our State Circuit Court out there is a court of trial court.
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5668.651,5671.762,Most people don't like to be tried in a criminal court?
1974.73-1148,3,34501,larry_r_gustafson,,5671.762,5678.16,"Well, they seemingly don't have any other objection and they think that they get more justice in the federal court."
1974.73-1148,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5818.443,5823.385,"I missed a little bit what your argument is, that happened in 1901 and 1903."
