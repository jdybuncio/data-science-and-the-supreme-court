1980.79-1252,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.919,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,57.663,59.368,Mr. Walston.
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.531,97.884,Is that really --
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,97.884,98.223,Pardon me.
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,98.223,102.531,"-- logically, isn't the second issue that you mentioned really logically the first issue?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,102.531,103.163,It is indeed.
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,108.409,109.033,I see.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,109.033,112.085,-- because we did not raise the second issue in our briefs.
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.819,113.952,Okay.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,113.952,116.996,-- in -- in behalf of the petitioners.
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.311,179.938,"Well, the Central Valley Project was authorized before the Federal -- the Federal Government made any contribution to it all, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,179.938,180.599,That's correct.
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.689,339.096,"When you talk about federal common law, do you mean something different than a construction of Section 10 just to overrule Erie against Tompkins?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,339.096,339.736,No.
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.912,582.87,"When you say the Delta, does that go up as far as Stockton?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,582.87,585.339,"Yes it does, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.616,654.668,May I interrupt you there for a moment?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,654.668,655.554,Yes sir.
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.554,666.832,"It could not properly do so because its only interest in the allocation would be in protecting the navigable, the interest in free -- free navigation."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,666.832,677.738,"That would be our position, Justice Stevens, but the Court of Appeals held that the Corps of Engineers could go beyond that situation and could control water allocations even where there is no effect upon federal navigation."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,677.738,681.199,Control only to the extent that you have to get a permit before you go forward?
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.199,682.241,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.241,691.922,"And if they review the facts and say, “Well, the only thing that is at stake here is an inch's change in the water table,” or something like that, wouldn't we expect them to grant the current system?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,697.443,702.33,"Well, it's difficult to say exactly what the Corps -- the Corps of Engineers would do with that kind of situation."
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.841,734.875,"If the Corps of Engineers say they are going to build a bridge across the river and somebody says they have got to have a permit, do you think they could deny the permit if they found that there would be no interference with navigation but they just didn't think it was in the public interest to build a bridge?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,734.875,737.281,"That is what the Court of Appeals said, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.281,747.127,"Well, do you think the Corps of Engineers could override the provisions of the Reclamation Act of 1902?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,747.127,748.068,"No, we don't believe that."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,748.068,750.133,Do you think the Court of Appeals thought it could?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,750.133,758.322,"Yes, I think the Court of Appeals assumed that the Corps of Engineers is not governed by Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.272,852.387,Did this -- did this lawsuit originate as a suit by the Corps of Engineers against the State of California or was it a privately instituted lawsuit?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,852.387,854.139,It was a privately instituted lawsuit.
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.865,884.956,"Well, so the federal Corps -- Corps of Engineers acting under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 was not complaining about what California was doing by way of diversion of truth -- the Tracy Plant and so forth?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,884.956,887.274,"No, the Corps of Engineers was not complaining at all."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,934.041,951.933,"How -- how much of this is speculation, as long as the Corps, with this broad body of regulations, was simply leaving you alone until a -- a private cause of action was asserted?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,951.933,962.784,"It was difficult to say what the -- what position the United States and the Corps of Engineers would now take with respect to the state water diversions in this case, (Voice Overlap) the Court of Appeals decision -- sorry?"
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.784,964.55,"File on this case, don't you?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,964.55,965.294,I beg your pardon?
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,965.294,967.917,You know their position from their brief filed in this case.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,967.917,970.999,That's precisely the -- the -- that's -- that's the point.
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.429,979.604,And now you know that they --
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,979.604,979.628,But now we know exactly --
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.628,984.194,-- the Corps of Engineers believes that the -- the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was correct.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,984.194,986.257,"That's exactly correct, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,994.433,995.13,How could we?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,995.13,996.332,-- have a point of (Inaudible)
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,996.332,996.804,How could we?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,999.692,1003.217,"Well, perhaps you could not, Justice Stewart, but we would -- we would hope that the Court might actually form something in the way of --"
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.217,1004.932,"Naturally, you hope so."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1008.33,1009.028,Yes.
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.381,1012.343,"But if we don't, how can we possibly reach the merits?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1012.343,1015.145,"Well, the Court has, on occasion, made alternative holdings."
1980.79-1252,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.161,1024.684,"But we have to get over the threshold first before we can get to alternative holdings, don't we?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1024.684,1025.807,"That is perhaps correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.807,1032.387,"Well, wouldn't -- if we said there was no private cause of action, I suppose you would set aside all the opinions and the judgments in the case."
1980.79-1252,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1032.387,1034.383,"Yes, yes."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.383,1036.799,And wouldn't that -- wouldn't you win then or not?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1036.799,1046.133,"Well, we wouldn't really win, Justice White, because we have to go back to California and then we wouldn't know whether we are subject to Corps -- the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction or not."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.09,1050.824,And the --
1980.79-1252,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.824,1051.229,What case?
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.229,1057.278,-- the Corps of Engineers might tend to say -- might -- might say to you I might bring an action to join you.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1057.278,1057.754,Yes.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.44,1062.285,As now?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1062.285,1062.533,As now.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.533,1065.531,And that the Delta plant is in -- needs a permit?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1065.531,1071.893,"Right, and then we would obviously take the same position that we take now to the effect that the -- that the pumping plants do not need a permit."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.893,1081.125,Well why do you think the Corps of Engineers did not take the position that the Delta plant required a permit before this lawsuit was brought?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1081.125,1082.731,"I simply have no idea, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1252,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.153,1087.069,"You didn't ask for it either, didn't you?"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1087.069,1088.099,"No, that's correct."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.739,1104.442,How did the -- how did the (Inaudible) got to be a party in this case?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1104.442,1116.214,The federal defendants were sued because the Sierra Club claimed that the federal Central Valley Project also needed permits approved by the Corps of Engineers under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.337,1141.978,"I suppose -- I suppose that technically, in the District Court, the United States might have -- might have counterclaimed or cross-claimed against one of the defendants against you to employ the Delta Plant."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1141.978,1144.158,I -- it might have done that and in light of its presence --
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.158,1146.155,And it hasn't -- it hasn't done that until now?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1146.155,1146.515,No.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.884,1174.152,"Well, what if -- what if it filed a -- what if it filed -- that's said in this brief here, “We would like the case remanded so we can file a crossclaim,” or, “Please accept this as a crossclaim.”"
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1174.152,1175.531,We would have no objection to that.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.616,1189.012,Because your -- your fear at the moment is here.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1189.012,1189.565,That's right.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.188,1232.347,"But we may never -- if it's a hot political issue, we may never have to reach it."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1232.347,1232.352,"Well, it's always a possibility."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.352,1247.681,"To say -- to say disposing of it on procedural grounds, I mean if the person who initiated the lawsuit was not authorized by Congress to initiate the lawsuit, that's scarcely procedural grounds, or call it what you will."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1247.681,1262.293,"Well, perhaps your point is correct but whatever the grounds, the approach to your suggestion would be one way for the Court to not reach the merits of the lawsuit which we define as the meaning of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.67,1299.719,You can always wait for the Tenth Circuit to speak again.
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.719,1304.265,May I ask about the status of the permit application?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1311.472,1313.057,No.
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.967,1317.791,I was just wondering why.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1321.497,1322.433,"Yes, it is operating."
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.184,1335.575,I see.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1335.575,1336.769,So the injunction and the fact --
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.769,1340.59,The application was made for the Peripheral Canal?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1340.59,1342.831,"No, that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.989,1350.553,-- (Voice Overlap) possibly no application necessary for the Delta Pumping Plant?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1350.553,1351.309,That's correct.
1980.79-1252,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.718,1378.138,"So then that's all the more reason to go ahead with the permit application, we've got plenty of time to see what the Army Corps of Engineers thinks about this."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1378.138,1382.788,"That's one way to proceed, but if we're not required to obtain a permit, then obviously, perhaps we should not."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.979,1394.263,That -- conceded in the case that there is an Article III jurisdiction in the sense of the case of controversy between these plaintiffs and defendants?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1394.263,1398.906,We have made no allegation that there is no case or controversy and I -- I don't see --
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.906,1404.7,I know that you -- you want it decided.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1404.7,1407.915,"Right, but I also believe that there is a case or controversy."
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.441,1421.588,"Well, the plaintiffs are the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Hank Schramm, a fisherman, and Dixon, a landowner."
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1421.588,1421.844,That's correct.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.844,1425.281,What stakes in this controversy do any of those people?
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1425.281,1430.858,"Well, you'll have to really ask the Sierra Club, the petition -- the respondents more what their interest is, but I think their --"
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.858,1431.794,I don't want to waste your time.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1431.794,1431.825,Okay.
1980.79-1252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.825,1433.653,You can go ahead.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1433.653,1441.997,"The approach which we're suggesting to this Court, again, I emphasize, focuses on the existence of federal navigation interests and concerns."
1980.79-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.612,1582.473,But that was because the State was a party.
1980.79-1252,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1591.457,1592.27,"Yes, well, that's correct."
1980.79-1252,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.449,1635.672,Very well.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1637.587,1640.489,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.953,1690.384,Why -- and your -- your position here as a respondent is supporting the judgment below?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1690.384,1696.372,"We -- we are here supporting petitioners on one issue and private respondents on one issue, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1696.372,1711.748,But your primary -- your primary argument is that the Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that there was a private cause of action and you asked us to remand a case with directions to dismiss it.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1711.748,1712.407,That's correct.
1980.79-1252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.983,1715.017,But you say that if we disagree with you on that --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1715.017,1715.909,That's correct.
1980.79-1252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.005,1717.539,Right.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1717.539,1718.695,"That's correct, yes."
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.695,1724.186,Did the Government take this position with respect to the Delta Plant in the lower court?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1724.186,1729.06,The Government took not much of any position with respect to the Delta Plant in the -- in the lower courts.
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.06,1731.387,"So your answer is no, it didn't?"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1731.387,1734.318,"No, but it didn't take a con -- well, it --"
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.318,1737.001,"Well, it did not press this argument about the Delta Plant."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1737.001,1737.017,Correct.
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.017,1738.295,And neither did the District Court.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1738.295,1751.241,"That's correct, that's correct, that's correct, Your Honor, but it certainly never, at any time, took a position that the State is exempt from the Act or that state water allocation systems are exempt for the Act with the types of arguments that the State is pressing here."
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.241,1754.015,But at least you didn't -- you didn't crossclaim against the --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1754.015,1755.871,"No, no, we did not, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.519,1758.709,"Which you could have done, I suppose."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1758.709,1761.027,We could have brought our own action.
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.027,1769.771,Why didn't the Corps bring its own action if it wants this case affirmed on the merits if it's determined that that there is a private cause of action?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1769.771,1778.615,"You Honor, what we -- the factual situation in the Delta is that there's some change in water levels."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.683,1982.936,"Do you say that this -- this very expert body let this mischief, if it be a mischief under the Court of Appeals' decision, go on for -- unchecked for a long period of time until its attention was called to it by a private litigants."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1982.936,1985.545,I'm -- I'm not sure how long it went on.
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.184,2005.821,You're even with speaking on matters of faith and morals.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2005.821,2009.567,Only when speaking on matters of navigability.
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.303,2223.233,Could you -- could you suggest that injunctive proceedings under 17 might be brought only by the Department of Justice.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2224.835,2230.599,The Corp of Engineers requests the Department of Justice to bring with receipt as their -- their lawyers may suit their --
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.599,2233.342,"Well, a request, but can justice turn on them?"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2234.934,2235.197,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.926,2242.598,And some are really with interior?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2242.598,2243.872,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.872,2263.138,"We'll that's, always been a highly contested matter within the executive branch as it not, whether or not the Department of Justice show control with the litigation of federal claims or whether other agencies within the executive branch shall have right to their own -- records."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2263.138,2272.599,"That's correct, Your Honor, but in this case, it says in Section 17, the Department of Justice shall control all proceedings to enforce the provisions of this Act."
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2274.89,2285.782,"So if somebody knows more with -- with the diversion without a permit, the only thing that -- the only thing the Court can do about it is to ask the justice to bring the suit."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2285.782,2286.045,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2286.045,2290.174,"And if the Justice Department says, “Sorry no permit is required,” that's the end of it."
1980.79-1252,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2290.174,2292.906,"However, Huntley contested the Department of Justice."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2296.584,2297.657,Yes I would think so.
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2437.678,2442.665,Does it make it -- would it make that decision reviewable at all?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2442.665,2444.101,You mean the decision of the Court?
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2444.101,2445.352,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2445.352,2452.424,"I think the situation now with the Administrative Procedure Act, that it probably would be reviewable."
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2456.349,2458.489,"Well, it is today?"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2458.489,2459.621,"Probably now, yes."
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2462.825,2463.447,"Well, I'm not."
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.903,2468.45,Probably so.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2468.45,2470.52,"Its agency action, I suspect, it would."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.371,2488.071,"Now, suppose the -- suppose the diversion from a navigable river is made by a person who asked for a permit from the Corps of Engineers and they say, “Well, you don't need a permit."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2519.3,2519.831,"Well, if he really --"
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.831,2521.169,Is your argument still --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2521.169,2525.573,"-- if he really wants damages, he can sue in a state court."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.893,2532.534,"Well, I'm talking about -- I'm talking about -- why would I ask you?"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2538.951,2539.927,"Yes, I think it does."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.19,2543.392,But not because it has been under controlled in the Department of Justice.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2543.392,2547.16,We think this Act creates no private right of action.
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.711,2587.077,"Well, is it your position as I have it clear in the case that Justice White proposes that the proper procedure that Congress intended was sued in the state court."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2593.334,2596.676,I don't think it would be a question of this Rivers and Harbors Act in the state court.
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.265,2605.478,"So, you're not just saying that no (Inaudible) because there is just no remedy under the --"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2605.478,2607.843,"Under the Rivers and Harbors Act, that's right, but they --"
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.843,2609.599,Even if there's a private violation.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2609.599,2610.382,That's right.
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.412,2617.79,(Voice Overlap) they could prevent them and could they go into --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2617.79,2622.323,It's not -- we're not saying it's preemptive of State nuisance actions.
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.323,2628.318,"What would prevent a state court from saying, “Well, we -- we think if you violate the federal statute, we are to give a remedy.”"
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2630.408,2630.88,The State --
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.88,2637.338,"Well, if you find they're in violation of federal law that you said there's no federal remedy, why can't the State provide it?"
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.338,2643.608,"All judge, State judges were -- not all to federal law."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2643.608,2652.296,"Well, if -- if the question of whether a private remedy is included in -- in a federal statute, it's a question of congressional intent."
1980.79-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.296,2655.6,Even -- even as in respects -- an action in a state court?
1980.79-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.6,2657.468,Sure.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2657.468,2658.075,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2668.414,2672.96,"This is not to say that a California Court, state court couldn't say."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2677.673,2679.864,"Certainly, if they wanted to say that as a matter state law."
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2684.059,2700.362,The historical argument -- let me just -- (Inaudible) then the historical argument is that there had been private action to try and prevent bridges and (Inaudible) and then that this was -- this statute was enacted to make something unlawful that the Court did not rule in the holding --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2700.362,2700.67,"Well, we --"
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2700.67,2703.25,-- but not to change the remedial setup at all.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2703.25,2706.592,"Well, we think it did change the remedial setup because of the way the statute was instructed -- yes."
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2706.592,2708.685,By the way of remedy that the --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2708.685,2709.263,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2717.934,2722.648,Did he say go ahead and -- sure he wanted it but there could be nothing else too?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2722.648,2731.705,"He did not specifically say there can be nothing else, but there certainly no -- no statement by anyone that were here by creating a private right of action."
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2732.671,2735.311,Are you in preserving one?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2735.311,2744.298,We don't think there was any federal cause of action before this and this statute.
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.298,2745.682,"Well, there were federal judgment (Voice Overlap) --"
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.682,2749.368,"1890, Act of 1899 -- Act."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2749.368,2753.226,In either -- neither one did -- did create one.
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.9,2807.86,What if -- what if one -- one were to find a conflict between the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2807.86,2816.701,"Your Honor, I can't see any conflict in here because in -- in Section 8 of the 1902 Act, they said they preserved the existing state authority to control their water acts."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.792,2833.455,But how about Section 1 saying that the project should be constructed and conformed there with state law and -- I don't remember the language.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2833.455,2844.347,"But, Your Honor, as I read your opinion in California versus United States, you say that where a state law is inconsistent with congressional objectives -- directives that it doesn't prevail."
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2844.347,2844.64,But --
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2844.64,2844.828,And --
1980.79-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2844.828,2849.278,-- don't -- don't you at least have to look at the two together?
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2849.278,2859.998,"Well, yes, but it seems to me that if you -- that if -- again, as I read California against United States, it says if there's a congressional directive that's inconsistent with the state law, it prevails."
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2913.8,2916.346,"Now, the Court of Appeals told them what they should do."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2916.346,2916.904,Yes.
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2931.609,2941.496,"But if it's an -- if the environmental standard or some other standards, some standard other than navigational, the Court of Appeals told them that that's okay."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2941.496,2942.11,"Yes, although, strictly --"
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2942.11,2943.717,-- to apply the public interest generally or any aspect of it.
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2943.717,2949.083,"Strictly speaking -- strictly speaking, I think that question is not here on review."
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2971.623,2972.925,"Thank you, Ms.Stillman."
1980.79-1252,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2972.925,2974.294,Thank you.
1980.79-1252,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2974.294,2982.818,Mr. Clark.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,2982.818,2985.876,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.74,3122.205,"He didn't need to add libel, did he?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3122.205,3129.389,"He did, I believe, You Honor, in that case because he was suing in a federal court and he sought a federal relief."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3130.84,3133.073,But you said it was a nuisance.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3133.073,3135.444,"But, Your Honor, it's only a basis of federal jurisdiction."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.444,3138.678,It is a nuisance because it was obstructing navigation.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3138.678,3142.476,"Yes, Your Honor, but it was between the citizens of the same State."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.603,3253.652,He wouldn't have had to show that the navigability of the navigable stream was obstructed.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3253.652,3254.991,"He would have, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.766,3280.537,"But as I read the 1890 Act, it's based in terms of the federal interest being obstructions to navigation."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3280.537,3283.476,"Yes, I -- I think that's true."
1980.79-1252,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3321.42,3326.923,Would you think that kind of a -- excuse me.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3335.087,3338.402,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3338.402,3343.881,"Well, all that you're saying, it's a cause of action for nuisance."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3343.881,3344.786,"Your Honor, I'm --"
1980.79-1252,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3344.786,3359.067,You only -- have the -- you -- you aren't saying -- I guess what you're arguing is that this isn't a -- that's kind of a case that wouldn't be a private cause of action under the Rivers and Harbors Act at all -- federal jurisdiction --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3359.067,3378.341,"Your Honor, that is largely -- that is largely to -- it arise at -- what Congress intended to do and I think quite clearly intended to do was provide a federal statute so that this kind of action would, in fact, arise under federal law."
1980.79-1252,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3387.162,3389.4,What if they -- what if they brought it at the state court?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3389.4,3390.969,"That is the alternative, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3390.969,3397.142,"Well then, would it -- would it be controlled by federal law or state law as to what a nuisance is?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3397.142,3403.956,I think it would be controlled by federal law if it were -- if the nuisance actions could be brought in state courts.
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.933,3435.035,"Well, it sounds to me like you're reading the arising under jurisdiction much like the savings to suitors in admiralty clause in the Constitution as if it were preserving a particular right rather than simply allowing Congress to create rise."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3435.035,3437.45,"Your Honor, I -- that may be."
1980.79-1252,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3461.53,3464.015,The Court of Appeals didn't agree with you on that point of view.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3464.015,3466.233,"The -- the Court of Appeals did agree, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1252,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3466.233,3468.513,The Court of Appeals said it would need more --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3468.513,3471.134,"No, they held that there is a private right of action."
1980.79-1252,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3471.134,3474.948,"Yeah, but I mean that they didn't say that the Congress didn't help out."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3474.948,3476.686,They said it was not clear.
1980.79-1252,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3478.692,3480.951,But you said it is clear.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3480.951,3483.083,I think it is.
1980.79-1252,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3557.982,3561.657,"On private action, do you want to move us back to the 19th century?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3561.657,3568.862,"No, I think we have to go back there because of this Court's pronouncements that we look to congressional intent."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3617.318,3618.223,"Mr. Clark, may I interrupt?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3618.223,3619.172,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3619.172,3629.384,"Putting the case back in the 1890 context, which you asked us to do, as I understand your argument, the private plaintiff would have had alleged something that can't be a private nuisance."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3630.155,3630.539,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3630.539,3633.244,-- a very direct entry to himself as on that --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3633.244,3633.966,Right.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3633.966,3637.582,"Now, do your clients qualify that --?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3637.582,3638.804,"Yes, they do."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3638.804,3644.56,"Which is the one that best qualifies in the said -- assuming that you don't have the obstruction to navigation, as I understand?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3644.56,3648.731,"Well, I think we do, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3660.467,3665.022,You allege that their use of the waters for navigation would be impaired?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3665.022,3666.247,"Yes, we do."
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3666.247,3669.845,"Well, that's the Sierra Club and the Schramm, the fisherman?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3669.845,3670.966,"Hank Schramm, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3670.966,3672.499,"Schramm, he was in San Francisco Bay."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3672.499,3672.817,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3711.018,3712.454,But his navigability is --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3712.454,3717.44,"His navigability is not affected, but there are members of the plaintiffs --"
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3717.44,3726.476,"And yet, you're -- you're relying on the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 as granting a private cause of action."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3726.476,3727.187,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3727.187,3729.658,And that was concerned --
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3729.658,3730.362,Exclusively with navigation.
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3730.362,3733.372,-- exclusively with navigation.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3733.372,3734.801,But I think not.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3793.067,3794.507,It seems to me there is a difference.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3804.472,3806.032,That -- that may well be --
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3806.032,3815.129,"Is there anything on the record that indicates that any of your clients, by reason of what your adversaries are doing, cannot navigate in the way they like to navigate?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3815.129,3815.916,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3825.75,3828.531,Unless you can't go because of the --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3828.531,3829.14,I'm sorry?
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3829.14,3830.841,"Well, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have interrupted."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3831.872,3842.064,We'd -- we'd simply allege that navigability has been affected and there has been minimal proof on that issue through the first phase of the bifurcated trial.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3842.064,3847.679,It doesn't seem to me that lowering the water cable a few inches would satisfy the requirement.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3850.474,3851.795,"Well, it might be, impudent."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3858.059,3865.725,"Well, we've heard this morning that a lowering of six inches affected trade on the great lakes by 300 million tons or dollars."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3941.777,3971.723,"Is there a -- if -- if you want to take us back to the 1890s as you have on for some purposes, wasn't it true in the 1890s and for many decades thereafter that no private claimant would have had any -- any right to challenge the action of the Corps of Engineers in refusing or in granting a permit?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3971.723,3972.948,I don't know.
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3985.594,3988.232,"Certainly, nothing like the administrative procedure."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,3988.232,3988.623,No.
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4045.559,4048.041,None of those are from this Court.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4048.041,4052.532,"That's true I think, You Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4123.412,4129.067,Can I -- can I ask you about the elevation of the Tracy Plant or the Delta Plant is?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4129.067,4131.667,"Above sea level, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4136.754,4141.319,"Well then, I suppose you diverted entirely the Sacramento River --"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4141.319,4141.89,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4141.89,4144.584,-- above the Delta Plant.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4150.584,4151.571,That's right.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4151.571,4155.823,"So, that wouldn't affect navigation."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4155.823,4159.667,"Your Honor, it would in this sense."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4159.667,4165.372,But you'll be still -- if the water level would be set substantially the same level.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4165.372,4169.537,"Well, I disagree with your premise with all due respect."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4169.537,4172.751,I asked you how high it was instead of substantially sea level.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4172.751,4174.08,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.402,4202.668,Goes down until it's replaced by --
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4202.668,4202.672,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4202.672,4203.186,-- seawater.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4203.186,4205.266,It -- it comes back in some time --
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4205.266,4208.741,Pacific Ocean is a pretty adequate supply.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4208.741,4212.217,"Yes, the quantity is adequate, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4215.123,4218.553,"Yes, but we were talking about navigation."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4218.553,4222.048,"If we're talking navigation, we can talk navigation."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4224.124,4228.722,"It certainly changes the character of the river from breakwater to seawater, which is a substantial change."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4228.722,4230.377,It does more than that.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4230.377,4232.642,Is that a Rivers and Harbors Act concern?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4232.642,4234.782,"Yes, Justice White."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4263.967,4268.665,You're trying to say you think you can't show it.Shouldn't you have shown that from the first day of trial?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4268.665,4269.756,"I think not, Your Honor."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4269.756,4271.777,-- accepted the premise.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4271.777,4287.293,We don't accept the premise but we also are under an order that defers until the second phase of a bifurcated trial all proof of the damage caused by -- to these plaintiffs by these particular diversions.
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4287.293,4291.035,"If -- if you're looking at the remedy, that's certainly a normal way to bifurcate a trial."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4295.902,4303.183,"Well, Your Honor, that is simply the way this case has -- has gotten up to this particular Court."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4304.892,4312.038,"Well, if it's a jurisdictional question just bifurcating that trial, it doesn't give this Court some jurisdiction it doesn't have."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4312.038,4313.702,"No, but I -- I --"
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4313.702,4318.394,The first issue addressed by both Judge Renfrew in the Court of Appeals was private cause of action.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4318.394,4328.467,"That's right and that -- and he found, and the Court of Appeals found that we had satisfied those tests on the record -- on the record before those courts."
1980.79-1252,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4331.735,4338.436,It isn't sufficient if you're saying unless we can prove it if you let us go back and do it in the second stage of the trial.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4342.665,4342.932,No.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4360.086,4363.286,Well -- I disagree with Renfrew in the Court of Appeals.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4363.286,4367.286,"Yes, of course."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4367.286,4368.804,We could just disagree with him.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4368.804,4369.381,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4369.381,4385.763,"That there was -- on the grounds that there was no private point, or I suppose we could say that disagree with them that the threshold showing of any injury to these people, showing --"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4385.763,4394.746,"Well, I think that in examination, the record will show that there is ample proof in the record of an actual injury to navigation."
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4404.963,4412.623,"In contention of the substitution of salt water, Pacific Ocean water, for fresh water is itself an obstruction of navigation?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4412.623,4414.428,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4415.872,4417.878,"I mean, salt water is more buoyant."
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4417.878,4418.855,It may be.
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4427.696,4428.995,(Inaudible)
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4428.995,4430.004,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4454.639,4456.117,Down to the lower part of the State.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4456.117,4456.531,Yes.
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4459.073,4460.238,Correct me if I'm wrong.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4471.402,4472.321,"No, I -- I --"
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4472.321,4473.04,Am I wrong at that?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4473.04,4476.013,"I think you're wrong, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1252,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4476.013,4488.034,"What is it in the record just so I can pinpoint something on which if you had to rely on the present records, what could you point to, to say that there is anything showing any interference with any of your client's present ability to navigate?"
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4488.034,4499.809,"Just the proof, Your Honor, that water levels have been reduced and that the plaintiffs used the -- the waters of the Delta for boating and other purposes."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4500.814,4509.268,Is there some place they can't go or couldn't go when this thing were -- were built -- was built that they can go now?
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4509.268,4518.213,"I -- I think that is the fact, Mr. Justice, but I don't believe that's the state of proof at this stage of the trial down below."
1980.79-1252,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4595.659,4598.138,Let's assume that you have a private cause of action.
1980.79-1252,2,29522,john_b_clark,,4598.138,4605.074,Assuming we have a private cause of action.
1980.79-1252,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4606.195,4611.371,Mr. Walston.
