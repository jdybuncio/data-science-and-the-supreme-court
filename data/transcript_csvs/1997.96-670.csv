1997.96-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.717,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-670, Murphy Foster v. Scott Love."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,50.674,54.698,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,111.595,117.258,"General Ieyoub, does any other State, to your knowledge, have this system?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,117.258,118.199,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.814,133.26,"And they each provide, as Louisiana does, for an open primary and no general election if a candidate gets a majority?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,133.26,134.322,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.322,145.848,"Now, California has a system, I believe, of allowing crossover voting in primary elections, is that right?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,145.848,147.698,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.86,152.443,And some States allow crossover voting.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,163.923,164.251,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.251,164.862,--in the party primary.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,164.862,165.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.523,174.808,But in effect Louisiana and you say several other States don't treat the primary election as a party primary.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,174.808,176.739,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.843,183.995,Mm-hmm.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,183.995,193.232,"And all candidates run in the primary regardless of the party affiliation, so that if there is not a majority vote, then the two top vote-getters go into--"
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.232,197.143,And why is it that Louisiana made that change?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,201.656,202.836,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.37,236.311,"Well, you... do you concede that Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact laws affecting the timing of election of Members of the Congress?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,236.311,236.902,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.147,276.098,"Well, I guess the question, really, is whether the statutes that Congress did pass are contrary to Louisiana's scheme, as was held in the court below."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,276.098,279.8,"--No, Your Honor, I would argue that it is not."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.409,319.376,"Well, do you say that Louisiana's system creates a vacancy, so the vacancy statute applies?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,319.376,329.591,"Louisiana's system certainly allows for the election of a candidate in October, as opposed to actually electing on Federal Election Day."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.591,340.97,"Well, except the Federal statute fixes the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November as the day for election for the Members of Congress."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,340.97,350.916,"That's correct, Your Honor, and Louisiana's statutory scheme does, in fact, set a date on the first Tuesday after the first Monday."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.989,359.241,"But the election, if there's a majority vote in the primary, does not occur on that date."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,359.241,385.159,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and I submit that what we have here is an old statute and new circumstances, in which case I think that we have to look to the legislative purpose and the legislative history, as Chief Justice Taney said, looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which the statute was passed, and Justice Holmes saying you can look to the respective minds of Congress."
1997.96-670,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.159,394.794,So you accept the proposition that Louisiana law de jure authorizes elections before the Federal election date?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,394.794,410.295,"That is correct, Your Honor, a person can be elected de jure under Louisiana's scheme, but what we're saying here is that Thurman and Butler wanted to protect the right to choose, and that is protected by Louisiana's statutory scheme."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.333,433.069,"But the question is when it's allowed, and I know that it's called an open primary, but would you explain to me why that isn't a misnomer?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,460.438,466.003,"--Well, Your Honor, there is an election on October... in October."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.003,468.925,So then that is the Election Day.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,468.925,483.604,"That is the election primary date, Your Honor, and if a person receives a majority of the vote, and only in that instance, they are declared elected, and there would be no determinative election on Federal Election Day."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.604,492.15,"Yes, but my question to you is, why don't we just call it what it is, that is, an election, since everybody votes, and everybody who wants to be in the running is there?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,502.776,505.317,"Well, Your Honor, it is an election."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.246,528.923,"But you could do that consistent with the Federal day by having, if there are two people, then you have a run-off, as can happen in some States."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,528.923,530.194,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.194,531.173,"Later on, before January."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,531.173,548.336,"That's correct, and that is possible, but the State legislature of Louisiana, which we contend has the primary authority to set the manner of elections, has acted in such a way as to hold this scheme, the open primary scheme, as the law of our State."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.409,564.257,"But what interest of Louisiana would be affected if Louisiana said, we're going to do our same thing, except we're going to do it on Federal Election Day and, if need be, in the 20 percent of the cases, we'll have a run-off."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,569.79,581.939,"--Louisiana could do that, Your Honor, but what we're saying here is that Louisiana's open primary scheme in no way really clashes or conflicts with the Federal Election Day statute."
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,581.939,588.864,"Well, it does conflict, because it has an election on a day other than the day specified by the Federal statute."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,591.285,600.061,"No, Your Honor, because I believe that you can't necessarily give a literal interpretation in this particular--"
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,600.061,600.772,Why not?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,600.772,601.223,--Well--
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,601.223,601.952,The statute's clear.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,601.952,604.423,--simply because I think that it might... it would lead to unreasonable--
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,604.423,605.875,What's unreasonable about it?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,615.452,616.23,"--We have that, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.031,617.702,"--No, you don't have that."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,622.575,636.325,"--Well, Your Honor, we submit that under the sovereignty of the State we have a right at least to set the manner in which our representatives to Congress will be elected, and it does not conflict in the sense that it's closely--"
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,636.325,642.791,"There is no constitutional authority on the part of Congress to determine the time, uniformly throughout the country?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,642.791,657.828,"--There is, Your Honor, but as was pointed out by Mr. Madison in his answer to Mr. Monroe's question about the Times, Places, and Manner Clause, the States should have the primary responsibility."
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.438,681.293,Is it us... is it up to this Court to decide whether Louisiana has acted appropriately in determining whether a pretty clear Federal statute is going to be applied or not?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,682.966,683.777,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,695.714,698.425,Do you think that this is a justiciable controversy?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,698.425,707.151,"--No, Your Honor, I do not think it's a justiciable controversy, because I fail to see the injury that the respondents have really suffered."
1997.96-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,711.413,712.044,So that--
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,728.875,731.416,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is my position."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.97,814.3,"Then your view is that no voter, as long as they could vote in something they called a primary, would have standing to object to Louisiana's deviating from most of the country in having what is the election a month before everyone else does."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,814.3,833.143,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that certainly there would... in our situation, where there is an open primary and an October election, when one fails to vote they have not really suffered an injury to the extent that this Court, or to the extent it would create a justiciable controversy in which this Court--"
1997.96-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.143,849.415,"If you... General Ieyoub, that's how you... if you fail to vote you have no standing, and if you vote you haven't been injured, I suppose, so the result would be that no individual voter could ever challenge the violation, or claim violation of the congressional statute."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,849.415,860.24,"--Your Honor, when it comes to the manner of voting, I think that's correct, when it comes to a State being able to set forth the manner of voting, as Louisiana has done in the open primary."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.24,873.048,"Yes, but of course, you can have someone who became 21, or whatever your voting age is, on November 1, couldn't have voted in October, but had the Federal statutory right to vote in November but you say, well, that's tough luck."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,873.048,877.832,"Your Honor, they do have a statutory right to vote in November."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.832,880.033,But there's no election in November under your system.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,880.033,882.114,"At times there are, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,887.119,891.932,"Indeed, most of the time it's resolved in the primary, as I understand it."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,891.932,921.872,"The history has been, Your Honor, that in the past most of the time they have been elected during the primary, and I will point out that under Article I, section 5, the Congress has the authority to challenge the seating of any individual elected to Congress and after 20 years Congress has never moved to remove the credentials of any Louisiana Senator or Congressman because they were elected in October as opposed to November."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.783,957.434,Under that argument you could maybe have your primary in September and then if you need a run-off have that in October.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,959.285,960.527,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.527,963.018,You don't... they could... you could just ignore the November date.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,963.018,965.702,"Well, we could, but we did not, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.702,966.231,You didn't.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,966.661,967.472,"We did not, and in fact--"
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.472,970.854,"But as a matter of law, if we're trying to figure out what the law requires, you could."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,978.891,980.323,"--Well, Your Honor, I submit that the--"
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.323,986.077,"Maybe it isn't necessary, and maybe it doesn't make any sense, but under your view it seems to me it really just isn't even on the statute books."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,986.077,997.614,"--Well, I think that Louisiana's scheme really does not in any way offer an abuse to its constitutional authority to set the manner, the primary authority to set the manner of elections."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.24,1007.441,"Yes, but you don't have to, if the statute means what you says it does."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1014.885,1017.266,"Under our reading of the statute, Your Honor, you're correct."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.005,1054.232,"General Ieyoub, you are making an argument here today, at least in part, that the voters don't have standing and this is not a justiciable controversy."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1062.577,1065.211,"--Your Honor, we have in our brief--"
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.211,1084.082,"As I read the question presented, you said the specific question presented is whether the election system employed by the State of Louisiana to elect its Members to Congress conflicts with Federal laws governing the time for holding congressional elections."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1084.082,1085.164,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1085.164,1088.216,And I thought that was the question we were going to decide.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1088.216,1088.887,That... that--
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1088.887,1092.77,Although you seem to be arguing something different today.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1092.77,1098.566,"--Your Honor, we raised subject matter jurisdiction in our brief."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1098.566,1100.707,"Not in the question presented, however."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1100.707,1101.097,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.136,1102.767,No.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1102.767,1106.621,"Your Honor, we have a very--"
1997.96-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.621,1108.351,Did you raise it in your brief?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1117.738,1122.342,"--Your Honor, it's either in the appendix, the joint appendix, or in the brief."
1997.96-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.908,1128.776,--The joint appendix?
1997.96-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.776,1130.188,Why would it be in the appendix?
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1130.188,1135.002,--It's certain particular motions that we had filed.
1997.96-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1135.002,1137.763,Not in this Court.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1137.763,1138.344,No.
1997.96-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.344,1139.135,This is all new stuff to me.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1140.054,1144.047,"But Your Honor, I would submit that this Court alone can raise the--"
1997.96-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.047,1145.018,"Well now, just a minute."
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1148.24,1150.241,"--I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.562,1171.415,It would have been nice to say something in your brief if you were going to make a big deal about it in your oral argument--
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1171.415,1181.381,"Well, Your Honor, I made a big deal about it in response to a question by Justice Souter, and I think it's a big deal when you really come down to it."
1997.96-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.751,1233.125,--But you conceded that you could harmonize also if you just shifted the day that you have this election from October till November.
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1246.485,1252.838,"Your Honor, that is within the purview of the State legislature to do exactly what you say."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.404,1320.201,"Is it not a fact that at least in presidential election years the percentage of voter turnout at the primary is only around 30 percent or so, whereas the percentage of turnout at the November election is in the fifties and sixties percent?"
1997.96-670,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1320.201,1322.194,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.194,1328.977,So it does make a... perhaps make a difference to the outcome of the election if you have a very low turnout in one time and a very high turnout in the other.

1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,1793.322,1794.334,That's correct.

1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,1924.7,1925.361,--That's correct.
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.361,1926.67,So you have no problem.

1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.473,1929.983,You can go home.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,1931.683,1937.329,"--Your Honor, the statute doesn't say you can have an election for Federal office only 20 percent of the time."
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.81,1942.662,So you demand more than a possibility of an election on Election Day.

1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.482,1945.424,An election on Election Day.

1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.997,2230.775,"Well, but then you're... then you have trouble dealing with the question whether... where both parties nominate the same candidate, and there is only one candidate on the November ballot."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2230.775,2237.089,"But that satisfies Federal law because those primaries, Chief Justice Rehnquist, were not conclusive."
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.748,2266.319,Then you're back to the Chief Justice's earlier question.

1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.285,2343.998,Then you've got to tell me why that's any different from the two-party primary that puts one name on the ballot in November.

1997.96-670,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2358.069,2359.51,But you're saying one thing more.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2401.888,2403.146,"--Absolutely, Justice Souter."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.146,2405.44,"All right, and do we have to get into this other issue?"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2434.539,2436.31,"It's not necessary, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.284,2463.357,"In other words, the court of appeals just dealt with this language, so if they decide to fix it up through this... saying, okay, they changed the words, so a candidate who receives the majority of the votes cast for office in a primary election will have his name placed on the ballot in November and no one else will, and there are no write-ins."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2467.03,2467.879,"--Absolutely, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.879,2472.804,We'll also have to deal with the writing of an opinion in this case.
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.549,2483.631,Sometimes.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2483.631,2485.142,"I wouldn't object to that, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.142,2487.954,"Well, what reasons would you suggest we give for affirming?"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2490.004,2500.42,The reasons that I would provide is that the State statute is in hopeless conflict with Federal law.
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.269,2541.778,"Mr. Baker, did I understand you to agree with me... I think General Ieyoub did... that when you have the two things, one is everybody votes in this, call it what you will, in this thing, and to be in the running you must run in this thing, that whatever label you put on it, that is an election, unlike a primary, where only Democrats can vote in one, Republicans can vote in the... they're not specific."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2555.198,2562.443,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, which leads me to respond to a point made by my colleague, the Attorney General."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.163,2597.416,But let me just... are you--
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2597.416,2598.555,Yes.
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.555,2622.16,"--If you are, let me go back to the Chief Justice's question, because I was asking seriously whether we have to reach it, and to force you to focus on it, I'll say, now we are writing the opinion in your favor, hypothetically, and we come to the section where... remember the alternative I gave you you said we didn't have to reach, they change it, all right, to say only this name appears on the ballot and no write-ins?"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2622.16,2622.791,Correct.
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.791,2623.172,All right.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2649.529,2664.869,"The argument is unconvincing because the election that selected the Member for office was held in October, and there was no election in November, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2664.869,2683.32,"Mr. Baker, maybe I misunderstood you, but I think the premise of Justice Breyer's question is that it would be okay to comply just by saying that the one who gets the most votes in October is on the ballot, and nobody else, and nobody else qualifies."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2689.183,2692.176,That's... maybe I misunderstood Justice Breyer's question.
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2692.176,2692.847,So--
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2692.847,2695.398,That would not comply with the Federal--
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.398,2698.81,--But it would if you said the two top runners.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2698.81,2706.236,"--That's... there are numerous correct, Justice Ginsburg... there are numerous possibilities for fixing this system so that it--"
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2706.236,2707.446,I see two.
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.642,2717.123,Or maybe the first and the last.
1997.96-670,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.258,2750.886,"What if you had a scheme in which the Louisiana statute said, whoever gets a majority in October will be on the November ballot and will be the only name on the November ballot, and there will be no write-ins, but unless in November that person gets at least one vote, that person will not or cannot be elected, would that satisfy the Federal law?"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2785.868,2802.391,"--It would be... well, under your hypothetical it would be legally possible to be elected or not be elected if a candidate did receive a vote, as I understand your hypothetical."
1997.96-670,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2802.391,2802.762,That's right.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2810.015,2842.165,"Which is distinguished from most... all right, under that... if State law were as you posited it, Justice Souter, and it would only take one vote to elect this person, this person was on the ballot, there would be an election on Federal Election Day, but it would not... there would be serious, profound questions raised whether or not this election satisfied this Court's First and Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence--"
1997.96-670,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.165,2843.297,What is the reason for that?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2849.452,2853.042,"--An election, by definition, presupposes a choice."
1997.96-670,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2853.512,2857.436,Or at least an opportunity so far as State law is concerned for a choice.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2857.436,2859.096,"--Correct, Justice Souter."
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.096,2861.44,"Now, wait a minute, there is a choice."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2871.233,2879.061,But what has happened... two separate primaries that have elected the same nominee--
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.061,2879.829,Yes.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2880.55,2885.423,"--The State law has not prevented that choice, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2891.768,2909.308,"Why should it make any difference that in one hypothesis the reason you have only one name is on the ballot is there were two separate primaries and in both of those the same person, and in the Louisiana case there were a number of people on the ballot and only one person survived."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2909.308,2921.397,"The difference, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist is that the... that those primaries, neither primary elected as a matter of right the person to office."
1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.803,2932.166,And why does that make a difference?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2932.166,2940.841,Because the State law has provided for its conclusive election in November.
1997.96-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.841,2945.953,May I ask a question... we're talking about a lot of hypotheticals here.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2960.613,2965.265,"Yes, Justice Stevens, they looked at this in the most recent legislative session."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.585,2985.888,"Do you know... have you looked up, or do you know how many States other than Louisiana do not allow write-ins on the November election?"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2985.888,2989.882,"I don't know the answer to that, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2989.882,2990.783,Do we know if there are any others?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2992.093,2994.366,I know that Hawaii doesn't allow--
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.366,2995.125,Does not?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2995.125,2996.307,--Does not allow write-in--
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.307,2997.218,So there are other States.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,2997.218,2997.706,--That's--
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2997.706,3001.97,There are other States that don't allow write-ins in the primaries?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3001.97,3002.821,"--Correct, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3002.821,3004.151,"Well then, we may have to reach the--"
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3004.151,3012.666,Section 8--
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.666,3014.699,--Would you be happy if there were a write-in provision?
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3016.26,3017.451,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.362,3020.073,There would be a real election.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3020.073,3020.563,There'd be an election.
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.815,3028.737,"So I guess you'd be satisfied if we allowed the... you know, the first and the last in the primary to be put on the ballot."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3030.079,3030.848,--If--
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.848,3031.579,Anything.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3033.56,3037.433,"--There... well, not anything, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.977,3042.366,--Right--
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.366,3044.129,--That's the problem.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3095.3,3113.533,"--Well, Justice Breyer, if a State's ballot access selection device is not conclusive as a matter of law, that ballot access selection device in the form of a primary would pass muster under the Federal statutes."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.533,3124.659,"In other words, you're saying that if Hawaii or other States that don't have write-ins in November do end up with the Democratic and Republican parties selecting the same candidate, that their election will be invalid."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3126.732,3127.441,"That's not my position, Justice--"
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.441,3127.751,All right.
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3129.974,3131.604,"--Well, Justice Breyer, that--"
1997.96-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.604,3136.617,"It ought to be, if I understand the rest of your argument, or if it isn't, then the rest of your argument has to be different."
1997.96-670,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3138.09,3146.824,"--I think if people had focused on this we'd have a few briefs here from other States that would be concerned about it, and so I'm a little uncertain what to do."
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3148.815,3157.631,"Mr. Baker, I thought that you had answered my question that this is an election when everybody votes."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3189.571,3201.239,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and for the added reason that those party primaries don't as a matter of law select the congressional officer."
1997.96-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3223.826,3235.823,"And Louisiana has been candid in describing its system, because it says, if you have somebody who comes out of this race, whatever it is, with a majority vote, that person is elected."
1997.96-670,1,35553,m_miller_baker,,3235.823,3236.444,Correct.
1997.96-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.075,3299.053,"Thank you, Mr. Baker."
1997.96-670,2,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3301.725,3310.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have no rebuttal."
1997.96-670,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.062,3311.905,Thank you.
