1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.538,"We will hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 86-836, Hazelwood School District v. Cathy Kuhlmeier."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,13.26,15.791,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,48.323,52.547,"No Court ever decided that question you just posed, did they?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,52.547,57.178,"--I believe the Eighth Circuit, Your Honor."
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,57.178,60.041,I thought that they said that it was not part of the curriculum.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,60.041,62.281,They said that it was not part of the curriculum.
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,62.281,69.336,But your question was whether a journalism as part of a curriculum is a public forum.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,69.336,73.79,The trial court found that it was found that it was a part of the curriculum and was not a public forum.
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,73.79,74.149,I know.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,74.149,83.616,The Eighth Circuit then found that because of the numerous ideas expounded in the paper that it was not a part of the curriculum.
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,111.815,117.298,Do you think that just the issue of whether something is part of the curriculum or not is really a question for us?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,117.298,127.414,"--I think, Your Honor, whether or not the matter is a public forum is a matter for you, because this then--"
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.414,135.201,"But I do not think that the Eighth Circuit would have held that yes, this is a part of the curriculum but it is still a public forum."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,135.201,138.272,--The Eighth Circuit found--
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,138.272,139.502,That was not a part of the curriculum.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,139.502,148.176,"--There was a finding of fact on the part of the trial court, and the Eighth Circuit never really did find that the findings of the trial court were clearly erroneous."
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,162.436,173.305,"Well, Mr. Baine, was is it a regulation or something at the beginning of the school year that said that the publication shall be consistent with the First Amendment or something?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,173.305,176.557,"No, Mr. Justice, it was not that."
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,200.443,201.712,"Excuse me, that appeared where?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,201.712,203.814,That appeared in the paper itself.
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,203.814,204.465,In the paper itself?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,204.465,205.256,In the paper itself.
1987.86-836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,216.192,223.508,"But it obviously was by the teacher, the journalism class teacher, or it would not have been in the paper, I take it."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,223.508,223.929,Right.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.13,246.512,Did it not appear in the editorial section of the paper?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,246.512,247.183,It did.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.183,254.718,Did not the editorial section of the paper say that the editorials did not represent necessarily the views of the school or the school administration?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,254.718,256.23,It did that.
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.916,301.959,"Mr. Baine, let me ask you one more question."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,301.959,302.339,Sure.
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.339,324.862,"Do you think that the Eighth Circuit saw this case as kind of an estoppel case where the school board had in effect told the students you are going to have complete First Amendment rights, or do you think that they saw it as a case that it did not make any difference what the school board said, that once you some students over loose on a newspaper that they have got those First Amendment rights whether the school board wants to have it or not?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,324.862,344.677,The concern that I saw in the Eighth Circuit's opinion which was not supported by the findings of the trial court in this case was the many and diverse articles that appeared in the paper that the Eighth Circuit seemed to find in the record were student initiated or student sponsored.
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.214,357.814,Lost all of its power.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,357.814,358.935,--Lost control over the paper.
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.215,746.44,"Mr. Baine, we have not analyzed First Amendment issues in the school context in public forum terms, have we, have we not usually tested the First Amendment issue by the Tinker test?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,746.44,757.556,"I think, Mr. Justice, that in looking at Fraser, which decided on the same day, that Fraser had a curricula aspect to it."
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.556,763.9,"But the opinion in Fraser did not turn, did it, on a public forum analysis?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,763.9,766.301,But it did not turn on the Tinker analysis either.
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.669,800.042,But did not Fraser analyze the situation as whether or not the speech had been disruptive?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,800.042,806.757,I think that it analyzed it a little bit differently than that.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.433,871.95,"Even if the school would not appear as condoning it, the school was certainly providing the paper and the ink and the money to write the story, right, which was not the case in Tinker?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,871.95,873.78,"--Well, that is true."
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.78,877.433,"It was their own arm bands in Tinker, they brought them from home, the school did not provide them?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,877.433,877.934,Right.
1987.86-836,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1097.308,1112.509,"And you would fix the limits at that point I take it, the limits of what the school and its principal can do, what I am trying to find out is what your standard is?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1112.509,1135.753,"I think that it is similar to the standard, Mr. Justice, as you said in Pico that while there may be some things that cannot be removed from a library, a school can make a decision whether or not those articles or books are suitable for different age groups."
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.165,1190.338,"Well, you would go further than that, would you not, you would say that the school could censor the paper if it had a lot of misspelling in it, would you not?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1190.338,1196.653,"--Well, that, of course, is the Reinke case, Judge, which the Eighth Circuit rested quite a bit on it."
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.581,1211.311,"No, I am asking what you would say."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1211.311,1214.144,I would say that defeats the issue of journalism.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.237,1222.1,What if the journalism professor just thought that this article is in bad taste?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1222.1,1236.86,"--Well, in the scheme of things, as the journalistic courses are set up at the secondary level, the teacher has a lot of control over good taste."
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.361,1256.324,"You would say that good journalists have good taste, and that you can teach that in a journalism class?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1256.324,1272.523,"Well, I think that you can teach not good taste, but I think that you can teach an acceptable standard which does not suppress viewpoint, all right, and then allow the student and everybody else to grow as their time and maturity grows."
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.523,1300.883,"Mr. Baine, supposing in this particular journalism class the faculty and the school board said we are going to let you put out a student newspaper and it is a little bit devoted to journalism, but one thing that we want you to understand above everything else is that the faculty advisor has the absolute authority to censor anything if he is a man or she if she is a woman wants to, it may be arbitrary but if you come into the class that is what you are going to come up with."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1300.883,1302.443,"Well, as a matter of fact--"
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.443,1310.658,"Do you think that would violate the First Amendment if the faculty advisor goes ahead and says look, I just do not think much of this article, it does not suit me?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1310.658,1313.61,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that--"
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.61,1314.401,Can you answer the question?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1314.401,1316.414,"--I think that they could do that, yes."
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.218,1341.869,"Well, it is really kind of a fine point of language."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1355.918,1370.737,"Well, the only distinction that I have between censorship and editing is that censorship in my opinion is somebody who is outside of the process who comes in and says for some reason or other you have violated whatever you have violated and I want to stop that publication."
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.737,1373.248,You are saying here that the teacher was part of the process.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1373.248,1379.864,"Part of the process and defined by the curriculum to be so and encouraged to be so, and found by the trial court to be active."
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.8,1396.635,"Mr. Baine, what that really adds up to is no First Amendment protection then in that circumstance, none for the students."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1396.635,1403.299,"Mr. Justice, I do not believe that there never is no First Amendment protection."
1987.86-836,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.299,1405.22,"Well, where, in light of what you answered?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1405.22,1434.639,"But I believe that in assigning a classroom exercise that the overriding interests of academic freedom, you know, in order to teach, that there is a First Amendment right inherent in teaching I think that was indicated in the Ewing opinion that said that somewhere there is a conflict between the academy's right to teach and the person's right to speak."
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.822,1484.822,"Mr. Baine, may I just interrupt."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1506.657,1511.549,"Well, first of all again, I would beg that the word censorship in the classroom be eliminated."
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.549,1514.771,"Well, forget the label, could they do that, could you give the authority to the teacher?"
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1514.771,1519.356,I would say that that is not the facts that we have in this case.
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.356,1520.486,I understand that it is not the facts.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1520.486,1522.899,And that is a tough hypothetical.
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.899,1525.481,But what is your answer to it?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1528.812,1537.976,The answer is if you can establish clearly on the part of the school a viewpoint of discrimination that that would abridge fundamental First Amendment rights.
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.976,1544.05,So then the school could not give total power to the teacher to exclude anything that he wanted to?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1547.533,1554.358,I mean there is no evidence in this case that that is a fact.
1987.86-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.358,1555.369,That does not help us much.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.369,1560.362,Let us talk about viewpoint discrimination.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1607.215,1624.496,"I guess the answer is if it is reasonable in light of the circumstance, reasonable in light of the age of the people, reasonable in light of the audience that they are trying to reach, you know--"
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.496,1628.957,"Well, he says we are trying to form some moral attitudes in the kids in this school."
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1636.363,1643.367,--I think that what we have in this case is an article that says that if we are going to talk about it that we are not going to involve individuals.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.367,1643.858,I understand this case.
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1659.637,1661.228,I am saying that he can.
1987.86-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.228,1662.14,He can?
1987.86-836,0,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,1662.14,1662.811,Yes.
1987.86-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.345,1672.435,"Thank you, Mr. Baine."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1674.949,1684.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.275,1751.248,Did the school pay for this newspaper that you are talking about?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1751.248,1752.898,Three-quarters of the way.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.898,1753.569,Pardon.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1753.569,1754.79,Three-quarters of the way.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.083,1765.027,But the school funded the printing and whatnot?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1765.027,1768.069,Three-quarters of it in terms of dollar amounts.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.069,1769.611,What school was it?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1769.611,1771.592,Hazelwood East High School.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.592,1772.901,"No, no, I am not talking about this one."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1774.733,1775.224,"Oh, I am sorry."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.224,1776.643,I know this one.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1776.643,1777.885,Let us start all over.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.857,1783.779,Do you not think that makes a difference?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1783.779,1785.069,I assume because--
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.069,1788.862,"Do you not think that makes a difference... what was the school, what was the school?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1788.862,1790.593,--He sold it for a piece of paper.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.593,1792.295,What was the name of the school in 1777?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1792.295,1793.714,"Oh, I am sorry, Public Latin School."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.71,1835.332,"When you say local control, Ms. Edwards, does that mean student control?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1835.332,1835.822,"No, sir."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.719,1849.551,And how does that help you in this case?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1849.551,1860.399,"Well, I think that when you balance or confront the First Amendment with that interest that it is very dangerous because it assumes ideas and viewpoint control."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.901,1867.274,Than if what were otherwise?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1867.274,1880.102,"Than if you had a situation of an Army facility where the Army's interest is in security, order, and maintaining a certain discipline."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.83,1895.621,Let me ask you one other question.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1916.767,1919.148,I certainly think that it does depend.
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.998,1948.566,"Supposing they set them a little bit differently, and said that this is going to be printed the way that ordinary newspapers are, it does not come out during class, you are going to work on it as an extracurricular activity, but here are the rules."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1968.619,1973.133,"I think that they can do that, but I think that there would be trouble doing it with an extracurricular activity."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.133,1973.582,Why?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1973.582,1980.316,"Well, because I assume that extracurricular means that they are only putting in the money and do not have a journalism instructor there."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.316,1981.988,"Well, supposing that there is an instructor."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,1981.988,1988.073,Then I think that it sort of falls similarly where we do in the middle.
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.057,2002.122,"But what does that distinction contribute to the First Amendment argument, the difference between the curricular and extracurricular?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2002.122,2003.194,Access.
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.906,2044.689,"Supposing it said the students are to write these pieces and we are not going to write anything ourselves, but the faculty advisor reserves the right to say no to anything that involves taking a position that is morally undesirable for high school students."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2044.689,2057.117,"I think that the school board, the principal and superintendent, superiors, can delegate the editorial function to an advisor, and he can exercise that in whichever way he thinks as long as it is not viewpoint based."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.42,2072.388,"So the advisor cannot say I reject this article which encourages what I think is immorality in the part of high school students, but I will accept this article which I think encourages morality?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2072.388,2075.77,It does not serve an editorial function and it does not serve an educational interest.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.241,2088.589,"So you either have to have no school paper or you have to have a school paper that carries articles like smoking pot is fun, that is the constitutional choice?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2088.589,2089.601,I do not think so.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.845,2100.597,I do not understand.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2100.597,2103.83,I do not think that it only has to be one or the other.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.321,2115.677,"I could set up a newspaper then and say you are not going to have any articles in it that encourage the smoking of pot, I can do that?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2115.677,2118.7,"--If it is viewpoint based, I do not think that they can."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.7,2119.758,They cannot.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2125.712,2127.963,"Along with other viewpoints, yes."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.156,2130.995,I understand your position now.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2130.995,2136.381,I mean I think that the viewpoint discrimination is sort of a key to what they did in this case.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.003,2198.81,"What about teaching in the school, I presume that you could try to teach the students that smoking pot is no good or could you, would you have to have a teacher come up and give the other side and say on the other hand maybe smoking pot is good?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2198.81,2202.392,I do not think that you can pair a newspaper with what they teach in social studies.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.392,2210.677,Why can the school enforce a point of view in the one case and not in the other?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2210.677,2217.442,Because student expression as opposed to the teacher's control of content of a classroom is a difference.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.998,2254.956,"So the only way to avoid all of the good stuff that you are doing in the classroom teaching them that smoking pot is no good is not to have a student newspaper, that is the only way that you could avoid the school formally subsidizing that opposing value judgment."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2254.956,2259.851,"Not to pay for it, not to have an advisor."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.851,2260.552,Right.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2260.552,2264.403,And not to allow the other viewpoint to be presented.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.316,2281.974,So I take it on your theory that the school could not even require that the students include in the newspaper the idea that smoking pot is bad.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2281.974,2282.935,"Oh, sure."
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.976,2286.688,"That is not First Amendment law, that is not First Amendment law."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2286.688,2289.901,"Oh, I am sorry, did you say that the school could require them to put that in?"
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.901,2296.784,"If they are going to have a story that says smoking pot is great, you have to have a story that says smoking pot it bad."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2296.784,2297.435,No.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.435,2298.116,No what?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2298.116,2300.387,I do not believe that is required at all.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.37,2302.937,What is required?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2302.937,2304.289,That they would have to put in a story.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.52,2307.001,I know.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2318.679,2319.24,No.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.66,2321.822,All right.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2333.79,2340.515,"If that is all the students wanted to say, and it is open to the discussion of student ideas at this level."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.515,2342.735,Unless red line applies.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2354.814,2361.699,"Well, we did not require a newspaper to with a political candidate."
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.699,2362.28,"No, your position is the school could not do that."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2362.28,2365.282,So I do not think that a school newspaper could either.
1987.86-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.282,2372.936,Do you think that the school newspaper can impose any journalistic standards whatever?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2372.936,2375.477,"Yes, through the advisor and through accuracy."
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.563,2411.431,"But that advisor could not say look, if you are going to say smoking pot is good, in fairness have a story that gives the other side, you would say that the school advisor could not do that."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2413.034,2415.315,"Yes, my sort of knee-jerk response I am afraid."
1987.86-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.74,2443.492,You do not think that you could have a class in which you are teaching students journalism and teaching them how to produce a newspaper and maintain school control over all aspects of that publication including content?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2443.492,2457.552,"Not if the content is placed and delegated to the students or jointly with the students' advisor, and not if it is discussion or an expressive vehicle as they admit this paper was for student expression."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.924,2465.888,May I ask you this question about this case.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2496.516,2498.879,If he--
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.879,2510.988,"If he ended up after all of the deliberations had gone into whether these articles ought to go in or not, and he comes to the conclusion that these are not very good articles for this school, I think that I will cut them."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2512.929,2516.932,"--Frankly, I think that it is not very strong, no."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.968,2527.278,So you would say that is a different case?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2527.278,2527.758,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.758,2532.461,So what you are really complaining about is the fact that this principal did not use very good judgment?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2532.461,2544.999,"That they reached up and got someone who was not part of the editorial function who was not skilled in journalism or experienced, and did it for a reason other than journalistic standards or editorial discretion."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.999,2558.589,"Well, say he decided journalistic standards, this article does not show the degree of maturity that we think that it ought to show to have the school name on it and all of the rest, there is some misspelling in it and some bad grammar, a mixture of reasons, that is not enough?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2558.589,2560.5,"The advisor, that he could do that?"
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.5,2563.973,"If the advisor can do it, I do not understand why the principal cannot."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2563.973,2573.858,Because the advisor is part of what has been delegated by the school to be the training and practicing of student expression.
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.858,2577.1,It seems to me what you are saying is if you are going to have censors that they have to be good censors.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2577.1,2582.863,"No, I think that they have to be journalistically involved, so the motivation of the school is good journalism and not a viewpoint."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.863,2591.279,It is a constitutional line whether you are violating the Constitution depends on whether you have a good journalist involved or not in the censorship?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2591.279,2597.193,The constitutional line comes with whether student expression is protected or not.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.967,2633.898,"Well, I would think that you would say that the principal not being acquainted with journalism could not order this piece deleted even it had inflammatory matters in it."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2633.898,2636.489,I think that is because of Tinker.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.002,2648.958,"Here is this principal who is not the advisor, and he is telling them to take it out."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2648.958,2651.269,I think that he could do that.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.442,2668.409,"But he could not say well, I think this article ought to be taken out because it involves some parents who really ought to have a chance to say their piece before anything is published like that, he could not say that?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2668.409,2669.05,No.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.05,2684.931,"Does not any newspaper have somebody who makes a judgment as to whether what is published in the newspaper will offend the community, I assume that any newspaper does not try to publish stuff that is offensive?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2684.931,2685.921,Sure.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.921,2688.415,Now who does that when you have a school newspaper.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2713.168,2721.163,"When the government is the publisher, I do not think that we can equate it to one person with the same rights as the private press."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.449,2736.885,"Once again, you leave us with a terrible choice, either no newspapers at all or newspapers that have to be offensive as no private newspapers need be."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2736.885,2740.628,"Well, why would a student newspaper need to be either."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.409,2742.348,Because nobody can stop them.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2750.503,2756.887,--I think that private newspapers print offensive things all of the time to some portions of the population.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.887,2759.228,"They do not try to, I do not think."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2759.228,2763.843,"Well, you have this advisor, this instructor supposing monitoring it a little."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.767,2789.959,You let him do it?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2789.959,2792.32,"Yes, I think he could."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.32,2794.961,He could exclude it because I think this will offend the community?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2794.961,2800.555,"As long as it is not only because of a viewpoint discrimination, yes."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.555,2801.987,"Well, but it is."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2804.278,2809.431,It seems to me that offending the community would not have--
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.431,2813.324,The students want to print something Hitler was right.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2831.756,2836.048,"--Well, I think that the advisor can exercise editorial control."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.048,2839.751,But the principal?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2839.751,2841.294,Not viewpoint.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.391,2856.384,"Well, so can the principal then?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2856.384,2863.286,"Yes, if it is inflammatory, libel, obscenity, and disrupting school, and invading rights of privacy of others."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.286,2884.551,I am puzzled by the fact that the First Amendment implication seems to turn on how far up in the educational hierarchy that the decision is made.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2894.708,2906.566,"Well, I think that in attempting to analogize to the private press which has a reporter, editor, publisher and an owner, that we have gotten a little bit away from the First Amendment application."
1987.86-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.766,2928.99,I must say that I did not get that impression of your case from the answers that you have given to the questions.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,2935.826,2943.44,"Well, I do not think that it is as important as where the decision is made and the manner."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.151,3040.112,"Given your different examples, is it of any significance in this case that the school had no objection to the distribution of xerox copies of the material that was excluded from the newspaper itself, they just did not want to associate the school officially with the material?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3040.112,3041.714,That did not happen.
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.714,3043.324,"Oh, did it not, I misunderstood."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3043.324,3047.858,"It is in finding of fact No. 21 from the District Court, it is in a footnote of the Eighth Circuit."
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.844,3059.506,Maybe it was in oral argument.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3059.506,3061.727,I probably said it.
1987.86-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.727,3064.288,"Oh, you were there?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3064.288,3065.72,No.
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.975,3074.576,"Well, I certainly do not question your representation."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3081.181,3084.283,"I do not think that it makes a difference, but that is just my--"
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.283,3100.074,"Ms. Edwards, if I recall your response, you said that it would be okay if the school said this is a house organ, we are not going to allow everything to be published, we are going to have the last word, that would be okay."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3120.658,3121.299,--Yes.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.299,3131.513,"Why should that be, I mean it is sort of a violation of the First Amendment that depends on breach of contract or estoppel or what."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3147.395,3149.706,"Well, I might qualify my answer a little."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.211,3169.637,"This was done too informally, so this First Amendment violation consists exclusively of the fact that the principal did not publish a regulation or something to change whatever course there was, that is the First Amendment violation?"
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3169.637,3171.43,--No.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.43,3176.213,"It is a pretty frail protection, if that is all that we are talking about."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3176.213,3181.256,"Well, I do not think whether they write a regulation or not depends upon whether the First Amendment applies."
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3189.182,3189.872,"Well, the principal limited it."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3189.872,3192.125,He did not limit the program.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.608,3196.286,"I see, I see."
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3196.286,3199.258,Now I think that he can limit the whole thing.
1987.86-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3201.78,3204.781,It is the ad hoc nature of it that you are objecting to here?
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3204.781,3210.414,"Well, there is some distinction between practice and policy I think, so I did not know if you were asking about that."
1987.86-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.268,3229.718,I wonder if you are saying that your students had a First Amendment right to have a teacher as good as Mr. Stergos.
1987.86-836,1,34398,leslie_d_edwards,,3229.718,3235.542,I suspect that things would have been different had we not had this change.

1987.86-836,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.674,3316.085,"But the court said that it was something more, too."
1987.86-836,2,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,3316.085,3318.937,You are correct there.
1987.86-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.452,3357.873,"Is there not also some other inconsistency, is there not a footnote in the Court of Appeals opinion that says that there was no active involvement brought by the instructor in the production, and a flat finding by the District Court that there was active involvement by the instructor?"
1987.86-836,2,38869,robert_p_baine_jr,,3357.873,3361.135,"If you read the 21 findings of fact, there is a lot of activity."
