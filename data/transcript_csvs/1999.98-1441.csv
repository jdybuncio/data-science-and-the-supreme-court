1999.98-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.797,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1441, Ernest Roe v. Lucio Flores-Ortega."
1999.98-1441,0,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,52.236,55.649,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.109,67.436,I can't hear you.
1999.98-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.436,69.139,Could you maybe speak up or put the...
1999.98-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.139,71.37,Maybe raise the lectern a little.
1999.98-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.37,72.792,Crank up the thing.
1999.98-1441,0,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,74.134,77.898,Okay.
1999.98-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,78.936,79.848,Yes.
1999.98-1441,0,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,79.848,81.778,Mr. Chief Justice...
1999.98-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,81.778,83.761,Only if you want me to know what you were saying earlier.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1004.197,1024.143,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1078.416,1084.149,"Well, Strickland...  Strickland says we're going to approach it on a case-by-case basis."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1086.813,1087.402,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.402,1096.799,"And there's an objectively reasonableness component of the lawyer's performance, and a prejudice component."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1096.799,1097.089,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1097.089,1101.751,"Now, the Ninth Circuit seems to have applied some kind of a per se rule."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1101.751,1112.999,"Well, what the Ninth Circuit has done really is to, in this context, revert to what we would characterize as a knowing waiver or a deliberate bypass standard, and we think that's right, it's completely inconsistent with Strickland."
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1121.936,1143.669,"Well, if we were to agree that the Ninth Circuit's per se rule is invalid, would this case still have to be remanded to have the court below consider the circumstances here, where the magistrate said that Ortega wanted to appeal and thought the attorney was going to file an appeal?"
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1143.669,1148.443,"Well, all the magistrate said...  the magistrate's findings are very ambiguous, and a..."
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1148.443,1151.954,there's enough that you could characterize them that way.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1151.954,1154.965,A remand would not be necessarily inappropriate once the Court articulates the rule.
1999.98-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.296,1186.809,May I ask just one sort of basic question on that point?
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1196.703,1213.286,"We think the rule...  the test is the same, but the result may very well be different in many of the cases, and that's because it's a facts and circumstances test, and the circumstance of a guilty plea is tremendously important, and that's for two reasons, really."
1999.98-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.725,1262.327,Let me just interrupt with one quick...  why don't you make the same presumption after a trial?
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1264.74,1265.649,That's absolutely right.
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.717,1294.688,This is why there is no sentencing issue.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1294.688,1294.878,Right.
1999.98-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.878,1295.329,Yes.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1295.329,1304.405,"If you look through the record here...  well, on the issue of the 3-1/2 years, that is an allegation that's made in some of the earlier habeas filings in the State system."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1368.816,1374.599,"Is that in fact what he got, as a practical matter, in his sentence, what he was describing in the transcript as you read it?"
1999.98-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.599,1375.09,Is...
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1375.09,1394.755,"My...  my understanding...  I can't represent that firmly, but my understanding from my colleagues from California is that that is realistic, that from a 15-year minimum, under the statutory indeterminate sentencing scheme, with good time you could be eligible for release by the Board of Prison Terms as early as 7-1/2 years."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1394.755,1413.175,"Is it clear from the transcript, and it may be that I wasn't listening carefully when you first started it, but is it clear from the transcript that he was saying that she advised him that he would get a 15-year term which would be subject to the good time credits, or that she was advising him that if he got a 15-year term it would be subject to the good time credits?"
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1414.346,1421.56,"Well, if there was any kind of competent advice at all, the advice would have had to be, the term will be 15 years to life, because that is the only term authorized by statute."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1424.753,1432.279,"So your argument, I take it, is we're not clear, the transcript is not clear on that, but on the assumption that counsel was competent, that's what she would have said?"
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1432.279,1435.412,"Well, and that there wouldn't be anything to appeal anyway..."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1435.412,1435.702,Okay.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1435.702,1436.102,because there's no other possible result.
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.102,1443.239,"But I mean, it seems to me that that reconstruction of what presumably went on is perhaps what he would like to test out on appeal."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1443.239,1446.371,"Well, I think...  if you look through the record...  this is what I was starting to say before."
1999.98-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.01,1461.471,Okay.
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1461.471,1462.9,But let's assume that's...  that part is waived.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1491.251,1501.105,"All the Anders cases, enhancements on all the Anders cases are cases where we are already passed the filing of the notice of appeal, or we are into the appeal process, and so there's a supposition..."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.105,1501.415,Okay...
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1501.415,1502.577,wanted to go forward.
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1502.577,1513.403,"but we make an Anders lawyer do what Anders says the lawyer must do, it would be strange if there were somehow a short-circuit to the process as you are arguing."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1514.885,1520.589,We agree that there is a constitutional duty to provide adequate representation about the question of whether or not to appeal.
1999.98-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.149,1536.878,Mr. DuMont...
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1536.878,1550.329,"Instead, what you should look at is whether there is any reason to think that counsel was incompetent, which there is not here, and whether there was any reason to think that a competently counseled defendant would have gone ahead and lodged an appeal, and the answer here is no, because on the sentencing issue there is no..."
1999.98-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.329,1562.786,So you're saying in effect you can't have a rule that says as a matter of law competent counsel must instruct on the appeal issue and get a...  an affirmative or a negative response one way or the other.
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1566.958,1569.011,It is an improper gloss because it...
1999.98-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.011,1570.03,To require...
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1570.03,1578.195,"would lead to inappropriate results that do not sufficiently respect the State's interest in finality, given the situation in which this will come up, where you will always..."
1999.98-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.195,1588.754,"But in your opening statement you built into it, and now I'm wondering whether you're taking out of it, you said, in a case where defendant was notified of the right to appeal."
1999.98-1441,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1609.627,1619.922,"Yes to the following extent, that it is always a facts and circumstances test, and if the defendant doesn't have an independent source of advice...  this is really what Pigaro said."
1999.98-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.295,1624.377,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1627.018,1631.611,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1645.44,1646.479,"26 of what, Mr...."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1646.479,1646.649,I'm sorry.
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.052,1650.552,Those aren't in the...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1650.552,1652.114,They are not in the joint appendix.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.884,1670.996,I thought it was 7-1/2 that he said before.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1671.887,1672.898,"7-1/2, I'm sorry."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.413,1748.167,"How likely would that be on your familiarity with California law, that he pleads guilty to second degree murder?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1750.968,1754.1,"It certainly is not common, but it's certainly possible, and..."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.1,1756.481,"Yes, but I...  my question, is it likely?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1756.481,1758.614,"Your Honor, I couldn't say it's likely."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.084,1761.826,"He was not promised probation though, we know that."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1761.826,1763.907,He was not promised probation; he was not promised 15 years.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.907,1773.544,"Is there any chance...  is there any chance on earth that he could have successfully appealed, claiming that it was error not to give him probation?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1773.544,1778.197,"Your Honor, the statement has been made over and over again that there were no arguable issues in this appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.998,1780.017,Just answer that arguable issue.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1780.017,1780.287,Yes.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.287,1798.689,"Do you think it was conceivable that for a conviction of second degree murder, where he got the minimum term, 15 years, he could have taken an appeal and said, you know, it was error not to let me go walking off on probation for a second degree murder that I have confessed to?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1798.689,1799.02,I do.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.683,1838.895,What were the facts justifying the plea to second degree murder?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1838.895,1840.848,"I'm sorry, what were the facts..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.848,1845.379,What were the facts justifying the plea to second degree murder?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1845.379,1852.475,"The factual basis was that there was testimony that he had stabbed the victim, who had died as a result of it, and..."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.475,1853.304,"What are the facts, though...  what..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.304,1856.347,"And on those facts...  and had intentionally done so, I assume."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1856.347,1857.598,I assume that's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.598,1872.267,"And on those facts you think it was conceivable that when the trial court decided not to give him probation, that trial judge would be reversed on appeal for not having given probation?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1872.267,1875.61,"Your Honor, it was available under California law, and..."
1999.98-1441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.61,1876.001,That's not my question.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.001,1877.901,Is it conceivable...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1877.901,1879.003,It is conceivable.
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.003,1879.771,To find reversed...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1901.528,1904.089,"Well, the factors that could have been affected by this argument of the district..."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.089,1912.885,"So what are the factors...  my question is, what are the factors that could have made this aas listed, I guess, in this Rule of Court?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1912.885,1931.048,"Your Honor, the rule provides that you can get probation if the facts or circumstances giving rise to the limitation on probation is, in this case, substantially less serious than the circumstances typically present, and the defendant has no recent record of committing similar crimes or crimes of violence."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.048,1934.908,"Fine, so my question is, what are the circumstances that might have justified it?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,1934.908,1941.534,"The provocation, the question of the drawing of the gun by the other person, the fact there was a general melee."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.683,2004.446,"Was this an Alford plea, Mr. Denvir?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2004.446,2020.094,"This was an Alford plea, Your Honor, and the second part is, the Court said in Alford that this kind of plea should not be taken until the judge taking the plea has inquired into and sought to resolve the conflict between the waiver of trial and the claim of innocence."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.862,2065.322,Okay.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2072.94,2080.804,The decision below was made on the basis that there was not a decision by the client to forego the filing of a notice of appeal.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.804,2081.866,Whether or not there were arguable grounds of appeal.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2081.866,2081.876,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.918,2083.889,They did not address the arguable grounds...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2083.889,2091.473,And we do not believe that there should be a requirement that a defendant in this position have arguable grounds.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.473,2095.025,"Let's hear you justify that, instead of talking about the arguable grounds..."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2095.025,2112.677,"Well, what I...  the reason we don't is because basically what was said by...  in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Pigaro last year, that it really puts an unfair burden on a pro se petitioner in the first initial habeas to be able to develop arguable issues without the assistance of..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.677,2116.39,What difference does it make...  what difference does it make if there are no arguable grounds of appeal?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2116.39,2117.39,"Well, Your Honor..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.39,2120.962,"In retrospect, looking back, were there any arguable grounds of appeal?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2126.196,2128.719,"Your Honor, the question is, how will that be determined?"
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.533,2171.788,"What worries me is that there are 85 percent of all of these cases settle, I mean, guilty pleas."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2171.788,2173.339,that's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.339,2179.222,And suddenly we're proliferating vast numbers of appeals in the case where there is no ground.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2188.299,2189.21,Your Honor...
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.21,2191.331,in a case where there is no ground is what's worrying me.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.331,2193.541,Why would he say no to an appeal?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2201.748,2202.66,"Well, in this case..."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2202.66,2202.98,say no?
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.98,2203.899,No...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2203.899,2204.329,In this case...
1999.98-1441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.329,2204.84,it's too much trouble.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2204.84,2210.504,"In this case he would have certainly appealed, because he said he wanted to keep on fighting the case."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.656,2215.837,I'm talking about the rule that you're proposing.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2219.781,2221.143,Because some defendants...
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.143,2223.122,and Alford briefs endlessly?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2223.122,2238.122,"When...  because some clients, some large number of clients, when they are told that there is nothing there, when they realize that the sentence is pretty much what they received, they're not unhappy with the representation that led up to the plea agreement, will decide not to appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.042,2241.856,"Hope does not spring eternal, even when the appeal is free, huh?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2241.856,2246.187,"Well, Your Honor, there are many plea agreements that have a waiver of appeal as part of them, and the client agrees to it."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.069,2251.09,That's because there's a quid pro quo.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2253.801,2254.362,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.362,2255.163,you forego the appeal.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2255.163,2255.463,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.463,2257.184,But I'm talking about a client who hasn't done that.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2257.184,2257.635,And...
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.635,2258.937,Why wouldn't he take the appeal?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2258.937,2261.328,He may very well have received exactly what he expected to get.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.328,2263.267,"The lawyer tells him, there's no basis for appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.267,2263.918,Do you want to appeal?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2263.918,2285.453,"He may very well do that, and then, and other people...  the other reason he may not is because there may be adverse consequences that could flow from filing an appeal, as we pointed out, you can actually be...  win on appeal and receive a more severe sentence, and in California you can actually have your...  you can lose on appeal and have your sentence increased in a substantial amount, so there..."
1999.98-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2285.453,2293.778,"Mr. Denvir, in this case it does seem that the Ninth Circuit just didn't apply the Strickland standard in judging this..."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2293.778,2295.088,Your Honor...
1999.98-1441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.088,2295.529,issue.
1999.98-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.529,2302.926,It seemed to craft some kind of a per se rule here of absolute consent or something.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2302.926,2333.276,"I think that the circuit, as the State would view it, did not focus and develop the advice of counsel question, and went merely to the question of whether there was a decision not to appeal, and in terms of the question of prejudice, we believe that the circuit's decision that all you have to show is that...  is the loss of a direct appeal of right with counsel, that is prejudice."
1999.98-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2334.705,2337.066,"Well, I'm not sure it is."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2345.53,2349.224,"Your Honor, I...  in the cases that the Court has decided..."
1999.98-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.224,2352.066,It wouldn't even mesh with Anders.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2353.498,2371.51,"Well, Your Honor, the problem is that if trial counsel usurps the decision on whether to appeal that is not trial counsel's to make, they will force the client to forfeit the right to an appeal where counsel will address these issues on a full appellate record and determine whether there's an Anders problem or a meritorious..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.51,2374.021,We're assuming...  you've got to take the hypothesis we're giving you.
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.654,2379.826,Why spin our wheels?
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.826,2380.306,You still...  right.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2385.959,2386.647,"Well, Your Honor..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.647,2389.281,"Yes, he was deprived of an appeal, but it was worthless."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2390.351,2395.553,"I think the problem is, how will the court determine whether or not there were no issues on appeal?"
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.626,2399.357,The way we're doing it now.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2399.357,2399.958,assistance of counsel.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.958,2401.18,The way we're doing it now.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2406.964,2407.434,We...
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.434,2422.822,"and those judges determined there was no reasonable basis for appeal, but you say, even though, you know, the best judges in the land look at it and say there's no reasonable basis for an appeal, nonetheless it was incompetent counsel for not taking this useless appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2422.822,2440.915,"Your Honor, I believe it's Penson, but in one of the Court's appeals decisions, even though the State court had found no meritorious issues, the Court reinstated the appeal because they...  the Court believed that the defendant had a right to counsel with the advocate's view of the case, and that..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.915,2441.896,Penson was...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2441.896,2442.447,should be substituted.
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.447,2449.77,"Penson was a direct appeal, and here you're on habeas, trying to reconstruct something that happened in the past."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2460.806,2470.454,"Well, Your Honor, I think the difficulty here is, the reason we're on collateral attack is because there was a loss of the right to appeal because of the ineffective assistance of counsel."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.454,2472.614,"Well, because the guy didn't file a notice of appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2472.614,2473.936,That's correct.
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.936,2476.067,That's what was lost.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2476.067,2509.72,"And as a result, the client lost the ability to pursue these issues on direct appeal with counsel, and this counsel never claimed to provide Mr. Flores-Ortega, with his third grade education and his Spanish-speaking ability, any information about the appeal, didn't say that this is your decision, you have a right to appeal, these are the kinds of issues you can raise, you may need to get a certificate of probable cause if you want to attack the guilty plea, all that...  all the information that a client needs to make the personal decision whether to file a notice of appeal or not."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2509.72,2534.617,"But I think you also have, if I understood what you were saying earlier, you have a separate answer to that, and that is, if you don't in effect require or impose kind of a per se obligation on counsel, at least to give counsel and to get a decision, then, in fact, the only way the meritorious claim is ever going to come to light is on habeas."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2542.26,2543.661,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2543.661,2548.846,"So if you don't do it this way, in effect the meritorious cases are probably not going to come to light."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2548.846,2578.774,"And I believe that's why the Court has never required that in a comparable situation, and I think that's the reason for the concurring opinion in Pigaro which said that really it's unfair and impractical to expect a counsel-less petitioner to be able to do the legal work to show the court whether there are or not meritorious issues, and instead, if counsel does his or her duty, gives some advice to the client, finds out what the client wants to do, and files a notice of appeal, then things will develop as they should with counsel and an appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.774,2579.945,But why is that so?
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.696,2598.227,Why is it the end of the world?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2598.227,2599.528,"I think it's twofold, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.462,2604.903,"Yes, indeed."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2604.903,2608.055,"And secondly, there is no right to counsel..."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.055,2609.264,All that for...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2609.264,2624.404,"on collateral attack, so how is this person...  this person has to go out, develop an appellate record on their own, do the legal research on their own, find the legal issues, file the habeas petition, and hope that at that point perhaps they will have counsel appointed to them as a matter of discretion."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.342,2641.555,"So you have to file frivolous notices of appeal, and then appellant counsel has to file Anders briefs in these frivolous cases."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2641.555,2642.076,"Well, Your Honor..."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.076,2643.756,It's a wonderful system.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2643.756,2655.494,"my understanding is that the parties both agree that if there is a request by the client for the filing of a notice of appeal, that in its...  and there is no filing, that in itself meets any requirements under Strickland."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.512,2686.025,"Counsel can do that, even though counsel believes that there's no basis for it?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2686.025,2689.016,"Counsel may be very wrong, as Ms. Kops was in this case, and..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.016,2691.678,"So is this called a...  what, an Anders notice of appeal?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2691.678,2692.299,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.69,2714.532,What does an attorney commit herself to in this case if she files a notice of appeal?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2720.827,2722.76,Not under California law.
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2744.191,2755.781,"What would your position be in a case in which, number 1, as here, there is a guilty plea, and number 2, there was a plea agreement definite as to sentence and that agreement was honored?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2762.013,2763.195,"Yes, Your Honor, because..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.195,2763.916,Why?
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.916,2764.795,Why?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2764.795,2767.998,Because I think what you'd have to do...  and this is not unusual.
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2785.461,2795.817,"But in a case like that, I presume the hypo is such that as a matter of law there could be no relief...  there could be no prejudice because there could be no relief."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2795.817,2813.869,"I think in a hypo like that, in most cases, if you have a proper relationship between the client and counsel they will abide by the decision, that they will have received what they thought they were going to receive, that they were told by counsel they would receive, that there were no appellate issues, and they will not request the filing of a notice of appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2813.869,2827.666,"Oh, I'm sure that's so, but you...  despite the fact that on the hypo there is, I guess we could say as a matter of law there would be no relief, you would still require the affirmative act of counsel."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2827.666,2836.012,"I think, Your Honor, that since it is the client's decision under both the Federal rules, under Jones v. Barnes, counsel has to file the notice of appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.012,2836.894,That goes beyond...
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2836.894,2837.965,That would be the Anders procedure I...
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2837.965,2839.835,But that's taking you beyond Strickland.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2873.047,2875.018,"Your Honor, I don't think it is."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.072,2881.082,"Well, but we're talking about the Constitution here..."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2881.082,2882.023,I understand.
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.023,2894.382,"not about the ABA standard or...  and certainly California isn't bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which you're quite right make it as you say, but why should we incorporate those into the Constitution?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2894.382,2907.499,"Your Honor...  Your Honor, the reason I believe is that in Strickland the Court stated that one of the basic duties of counsel is to provide consultation to the client about important decisions."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.835,2931.987,With decisions within the realm of the possible.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2936.507,2937.7,No.
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.67,2948.316,"If appeal is not available, if there's nothing to be gained from it, counsel doesn't have to advise about that utterly impractical, never-will-happen..."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2948.316,2949.458,"Well, Your Honor, I..."
1999.98-1441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.458,2949.618,it seems to me.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2949.618,2960.765,"If appeal is available, then it is not talking about something that's a will-of-the wisp, and the client has a right to pursue that appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.765,2962.187,The issue isn't whether appeal is available.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2967.24,2976.726,"Well, Your Honor, the Court has said, though, that it s not counsel to decide that, and the defendant may, in that situation, want a second opinion."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.406,2979.818,"It could well be, and we're looking back."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,2988.053,2998.819,"I think in this case, Your Honor, because of incompetence of counsel, he lost his direct appeal of right with new counsel and two arguable issues, and an opportunity perhaps..."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.819,3002.372,"Leave that out of the case, because that's not the rule that you're asking us to adopt."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3005.635,3015.251,"That's correct, Your Honor, but I...  I'm not...  I'm asking the Court...  the Court could have a more limited rule, and I believe that Mr. Flores-Ortega comes within that more limited rule."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3015.251,3016.44,But your rule goes beyond Strickland.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3017.352,3018.333,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3018.333,3023.076,"How does it...  why does it not go beyond Strickland, at least on the prejudice prong?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3023.076,3038.526,"Your Honor, because I don't think the Court has at any point in any of its decisions, Rodriquez, or Penson, or Evitts, any of those, required that an unrepresented defendant prove that there were meritorious issues."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3056.147,3064.122,I can understand your argument in a case in which at least it is conceivable...  strike the word conceivable.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3115.116,3125.524,"Well, Your Honor, if there could be a reliable determination based on whatever would be before the Court that there is no possibility of relief, then I would agree."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3131.465,3134.438,Why isn't it sound to determine it on the basis of the hypothesis?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3150.799,3152.069,"That may be that it should be, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.714,3184.86,"Is it immaterial that the court told the defendant in this case, you have a right to appeal, so many days, we'll appoint a counsel if you can't pay for one?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3187.902,3197.138,"Well, there was a statement which was not required by State law that...  and it was, you can file an appeal 60 days from today in this court."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.029,3212.328,He doesn't speak English?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3212.328,3213.38,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3214.131,3214.789,Or he does speak Spanish?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3214.789,3219.554,"He speaks Spanish, and certified interpreters were used in all the proceedings."
1999.98-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.415,3226.199,"He doesn't speak any, but the court's statement to him was translated to him, you said?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3226.199,3226.678,There was...  absolutely.
1999.98-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3227.219,3236.144,"But you say, as a...  you're favoring the Ninth Circuit per se rule, so that it would be immaterial that the court in fact notified the defendant had a right to appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3236.144,3260.701,"Your Honor, because I think that what caused the loss of the right to direct appeal was the ineffective assistance of defense counsel, that regardless of any advisement that was given by the court, there was a factual finding that Mr. Flores-Ortega did not understand what an appeal was, therefore there was no movement to exercise the decision to have an appeal."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.517,3281.345,"In your experience of the, say, 80 to 90 percent of the cases that are settled by a guilty plea, of that, what percentage in your experience appeal?"
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3281.345,3288.528,"Your Honor, if it is settled by a guilty plea with a predetermined sentence, almost nobody appeals."
1999.98-1441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.075,3304.358,Do you have any...  can you give me any ball park...  because you defend...  you're aware of it.
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3305.75,3318.989,"I don't think I could give any reliable, but if there is truly a predetermined sentence, then there's almost never an appeal, and if there is not a predetermined sentence, therefore there usually are arguable issues, then there is an appeal and it's pursued."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.621,3327.745,Does California have sentencing guidelines the same way the United States does?
1999.98-1441,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3327.745,3331.106,"Your Honor, it has a determined sentencing law, which is very complex."
1999.98-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.462,3355.283,"Thank you, Mr. Denvir."
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3357.276,3379.148,"First, with regard to the Harvey issue, Harvey is a California case which states that a sentencing court cannot rely on facts which are related solely to accounts dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain."
1999.98-1441,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3514.729,3531.299,"Mr. O'Connor, do you agree on the basic proposition that a trial counsel or, in this case, plea and sentencing counsel, does have an obligation to explain to the defendant what an appeal is and what his rights are?"
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3539.013,3542.265,"Well, Your Honor, there's an obligation under only two circumstances."
1999.98-1441,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3550.541,3555.596,"So if he doesn't...  defendant in this case, the magistrate found the defendant didn't know anything about an appeal."
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3558.497,3559.216,No.
1999.98-1441,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3559.216,3561.179,"and if he doesn't have the knowledge to inquire, it's too bad?"
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3561.179,3562.08,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1441,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3581.532,3584.804,And what authority...
1999.98-1441,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3584.804,3585.936,Has that been determined...
1999.98-1441,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3585.936,3587.527,What authority do you have for that?
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3587.527,3587.877,"Well, yes, that's..."
1999.98-1441,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3587.877,3588.278,by anybody?
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3588.278,3595.183,"Well, in part we're relying on a Ninth Circuit case called Marrow, which we cited in our briefs, and a number of other..."
1999.98-1441,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3595.183,3600.366,But in this case I had assumed there's been no determination whether there were arguable grounds.
1999.98-1441,3,38199,paul_e_oconnor,,3600.366,3603.827,"Well, that's simply the Warden's position, that there are no arguable grounds."
1999.98-1441,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3603.827,3605.778,"Thank you, Mr. O'Connor."
