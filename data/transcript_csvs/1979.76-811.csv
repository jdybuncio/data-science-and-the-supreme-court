1979.76-811,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.595,"First case on today's calendar is number 76-811, Regents of University of California against Bakke."
1979.76-811,0,15704,archibald_cox,,13.514,17.889,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.76-811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,388.179,395.302,"Mr. Cox, is there something in the record indicating who -- who proposed or adopted the Task Force Program?"
1979.76-811,0,15704,archibald_cox,,395.302,400.248,It's indicated then it was adopted by the faculty in the school.
1979.76-811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,406.05,409.396,"But he wasn't -- he wasn't there then, was he?"
1979.76-811,0,15704,archibald_cox,,409.396,409.653,No.
1979.76-811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,424.815,429.536,Is there anything in the record indicating the approval of the Regents other than the fact they're defendant â€“ they are defendant --
1979.76-811,0,15704,archibald_cox,,429.536,437.181,"No, because the Regents had delegated to each faculty of each school, the responsibility for admissions."
1979.76-811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,437.181,437.762,Thank you.
1979.76-811,0,15704,archibald_cox,,437.762,447.871,"So, this was left to the different colleges and very wisely, I think because autonomous institutions, each trying to solve this problem in their own way."
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2667.994,2672.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2942.394,2956.831,"Mr. Solicitor General, is there any evidence in this record that this University its medical school at Davis has ever engaged in any exclusion or discrimination on the basis of race?"
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2956.831,2967.073,"There is no evidence in the record that this University has and indeed, I would be surprised to have found it in according to the state of this record."
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.203,3036.984,Including -- do you include in that conduct outside the State of California?
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3036.984,3043.529,I would include conduct throughout the nation because we are the nation without barriers to travel.
1979.76-811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.002,3178.779,"General McCree does the United States really care whether the decisions made by the faculty, by the President or the Board of Regents?"
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3178.779,3182.76,The United States should not care about that.
1979.76-811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.417,3201.74,Do you think it would be any different if it have been made by the Board of Regents rather than by the faculty or by the legislature?
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3201.74,3205.478,"I would think the result should be the same, Your Honor."
1979.76-811,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3205.478,3217.597,"Mr. Solicitor General, you suggest on this question of invidiousness that there should be a remand to take further evidence to find out among other things why the Asian-Americans were included in the program."
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3232.13,3239.005,"Well, we submit that a remedy is intended to right or wrong."
1979.76-811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.592,3344.047,What does this record lack with respect to Asian-Americans that it has with respect to the other minorities who are included in the program?
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3344.047,3389.158,"Well among other things, this record -- well, it isn't so much the record, let me correct that answer, is it is available data in the form of statistics, census data which will show for example and that black physicians comprise something like 2.4 that's an approximation of all the physicians that the native American figure, I believe, is less than 1% that the Hispanic or Chicano figure is approximately 2%, and we just don't know the impact of that within the Asian-American community."
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.976,3406.549,"Does the record show the number of the doctors, lawyers, engineers who are of Asian ancestry and partial Asian ancestry in California?"
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3406.549,3438.222,"There is a reference, I believe its page 42 of my brief that has a census figure that has a grow statement of the number of professional of the number of professional persons within -- may correct that, its page 42 and it is the footnote and there's a reference."
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.648,3468.415,29% is substantially higher than their proportion of the total population is that so?
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3468.415,3474.077,This would appear to be so but it would be significant only if it were monolithic community.
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3494.747,3510.405,"But on its face, the 29% hardly would support any ready conclusion that there's pervasive discrimination against people of Asian ancestry, is that so?"
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3510.405,3515.693,"On this record, this is possible but we know how sparse this record is."
1979.76-811,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3570.841,3579.646,"May I ask Mr. Solicitor General, do you agree with Mr. Cox that the we ought not to address the Title VI question?"
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3579.646,3592.953,"I believe that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1969 states no principle, no substantive principle different from the Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.76-811,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3592.953,3595.135,"Well, that goes to the merits."
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3597.403,3600.326,"Well, I disagree with him in one respect."
1979.76-811,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3635.216,3640.185,Of course he may -- he may still urge it.
1979.76-811,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3640.185,3644.128,He may and unfortunately he follows that.
1979.76-811,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.481,3716.74,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,3717.833,3737.44,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, I think that the Honorable Wade McCree's last remark was something of a prediction that I might not disappoint him and I will try not to."
1979.76-811,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3871.652,3877.566,You spoke Mr. Colvin of the right to admission; you don't seriously submit that he had a right to be --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,3877.566,3883.487,I wanted to get to that and I quite agree and let me say it now so that it's out of the way.
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4084.12,4086.857,"But no one is charging you with laches here, Mr. Colvin."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4086.857,4100.327,No but I -- I'm relieved to hear but that wasn't exactly my point if I may just continue for the moment.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4138.818,4142.499,Am I correct that Dr. Lowrey was not dean when this --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4142.499,4143.148,No.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4143.148,4146.274,"He was not dean when all this occurred, was he?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4146.274,4149.158,"No, that is not -- it's true and it's not true."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4149.801,4153.532,But was he dean when this regulation was put into effect.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4153.532,4156.264,The answer to that is no but the answer to the question --
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4156.264,4161.988,"Well, my point is -- if I may finish point."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4166.107,4167.421,"No, we accepted --"
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4167.421,4169.524,All you had was hearsay.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4169.524,4206.253,"Well, it was hearsay by the Dean of Admissions who was administering a program and if I may just say this I will not attempt to get into a discussion of what is hearsay and what is not hearsay but the fact of the matter is that it was Dr. Lowrey who was administering the program by both in 1973 and in 1974 and more than that, it was Dr. Lowrey himself who had reviewed and interviewed Mr. Bakke in 1974."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4237.17,4241.164,Did you take a deposition of anybody who knew what happened.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4241.164,4245.933,What we think and was quite clear.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4247.716,4250.532,"Well, you couldn't answer that simply by yes or no."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4250.532,4251.902,My answer is yes.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4271.727,4278.195,"Well, what was the decision of the committee of the faculty?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4278.195,4282.928,The doctor -- Mr. Bakke was turned down for admission --
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4282.928,4283.45,"No, no."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4286.808,4293.739,The rules were simply that 8% -- that 16% of the entering class.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4293.739,4295.052,But what about the 8% --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4295.052,4296.908,"No, no 8% is the number."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4297.191,4300.324,"Well, 8% was before and now it's 16."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4300.324,4301.743,May I start over again?
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4304.059,4305.737,"No, no 16 people."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4306.919,4312.112,"No, in the early years of the school there were just 50 admitted in the entering class."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4312.112,4314.154,"Well, does the rule say 16%?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4314.154,4315.551,The rule says 16%.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4315.551,4316.713,"Oh, 16."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4316.713,4318.095,16%
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4318.095,4320.516,Where is the rule in the record?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4320.516,4322.171,"Well, I --"
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4322.171,4322.672,It's in Dr. Lowrey's --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4322.672,4324.413,In Dr. Lowrey's deposition.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4324.413,4327.04,But there's no other thing there except that?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4327.04,4328.55,That's where we find it yes.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4328.55,4331.642,And that's hearsay.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4331.642,4346.707,"In my judgment -- in my judgment, it would only be hearsay in the sense that it relates to the historical origin of the rule but it is not hearsay as it relates to the way the rule was imposed in the two years that Dr. -- that Mr. --"
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4346.707,4350.785,My only point I say is that we don't know how the rule came about.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4350.785,4353.658,"Well, we do know that it came about by faculty vote."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4353.901,4355.438,Right.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4355.438,4356.514,That is in the record.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4356.514,4358.577,And what else do we know?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4358.577,4366.356,"Well, we also -- we also know that statistics were kept and they are in the record for each of the --"
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4366.356,4371.464,Now what criteria was set down for disadvantaged?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4371.464,4374.023,That question was asked of Dr. Lowrey.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4397.024,4400.067,He's talking about the present time when he was testifying.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4400.067,4401.036,"Yes, yes."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4401.036,4403.463,"Well, I'm trying to find out what happened when it was adopted."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4408.739,4410.965,I don't believe -- I don't believe there was.
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4452.038,4461.42,"There's no -- no controversy between counsel as to the existence of the plan or as kind to those or what it provided, is there?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4461.42,4473.867,"Well, we believe -- yes, we believe that there is a very important kind of controversy which is involved here and that is precisely the controversy over the concept of quota."
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4473.867,4476.303,But is it a factual controversy or --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4476.303,4478.909,"Well, we think -- we think in general, yes."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4510.181,4514.51,"Mr. Colvin, to follow up a minute Justice Powell's question."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4532.018,4552.215,Although the factual question if I may respond to that just briefly arises in somehow in a different way and let me illustrate it this way because it is a factual -- there is a factual circumstance involved and let me try to spell out what I believe that factual circumstance to be.
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4649.521,4655.745,"Yes, but Mr. Colvin, you do not dispute the basic finding that everybody admitted under the special program was qualified."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4655.745,4657.002,I certainly do.
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4679.891,4682.205,"Mr. Colvin, don't get too far away from the microphone if you want to stay on the record."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4682.205,4685.87,"I'm sorry, sir."
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4721.142,4731.753,But there's nothing in the record to indicate that they chose the 2.5 figure because they felt that anyone with a lesser score would not be qualified either to do the academic work or to practice medicine.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4731.753,4734.119,"No, but that was their rule."
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4744.391,4746.207,"Yes, it was an administrative basis."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4746.207,4749.858,"It was an administrative basis but at least, it was their basis."
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4749.858,4761.695,"Well then, but how does that go -- why do you disagree with the proposition that there's nothing in this record to show that any of the special people were qualified to study and to practice."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4761.695,4771.053,"We simply say that we do not agree, we do not agree that there is a showing that they were qualified."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4887.978,4905.259,"Well, for purposes of this argument though, you don't -- do you need to go any farther than to assert and convince somebody that he was deprived of an opportunity to compete for one of the six teams seats because of his race."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4906.687,4907.098,"Well, yes."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4910.914,4914.175,"If you don't need to go any farther, you simply are taking up a lot of your time."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4914.175,4940.114,"Well, I don't want to take up my time except to say that there is within this record the stipulation of the Regents of the University of California that Mr. Bakke was deprived of the opportunity to attend the University of California Medical School at Davis because of the use of the 16 places by the special admissions program."
1979.76-811,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4940.114,4945.872,"Mr. Colvin, may I follow up on Justice White's observation."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,4968.419,4986.862,"Yes, I would like to address the problems that arise with quota and the problems that arise with race, and I would like also to address the alternative which the University suggests."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5056.192,5073.046,"Well, what's your response to the assertion of the University that it was entitled to have a special program and take race into account and that under the Fourteenth Amendment there was no barrier to it doing that because of the interest that were involved."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5075.296,5087.608,Our response to that is fundamentally that race an improper classification in this situation.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5092.735,5109.889,"Well, do you disagree with the California Supreme Court when it said that -- when it identified the interest that it understood the University was taking into account in this special program and agreed with the University's submission that these were compelling interests."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5109.889,5114.196,The California Court made those assumptions arguendo.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5114.196,5116.017,"Well, do you agree with them or not?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5116.017,5123.747,"Well, we think -- we think that we need not disagree with them that they are fair -- that they are fair assumptions but if went much further."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5123.747,5131.833,Well then you -- you agree that -- you don't disagree then that these interests they're asserting are compelling interests?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5131.833,5139.751,"We assume as the Court did that those specific interests, not all of them but that those specific interests are compelling interests."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5140.998,5156.416,"But do you agree then -- then you also agree that if they are compelling, and if there were no alternatives, if there were no alternatives that the fact that -- would you agree that the racial classification could be upheld?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5156.416,5158.553,We might someday come to that.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5162.93,5171.486,"So you -- part of your submission is even if things are compelling interests, even if there is no alternative, use of the racial classification is unconstitutional."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5171.486,5174.034,"We believe that it's unconstitutional, we do."
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5174.034,5177.298,It's not because it's limited rigidly to 16?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5177.298,5192.229,"No, not because it's limited to 16 but because the concept of race itself as a classification becomes in our history and in our understanding an unjust and improper basis upon which to judge people."
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5206.015,5216.938,"Well, do you mean by that as to the 16 places, the allocation was dominantly by race?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5216.938,5217.091,Oh!
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5295.143,5305.806,"Well, I take it then that if we disagreed with you that that racial classification is invalid even if there are compelling interests and even if there's no alternative."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5313.645,5321.122,"Well, we do support the conclusion that there were alternatives and I would like to comment on that face of the case."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5385.401,5390.962,"Mr. Colvin, what if the University says, â€œWe don't want to just aim at the disadvantaged."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5400.111,5420.072,"To the extent that the judgment is made on whether those doctors are disadvantaged, it is a legitimate means to the extent and the univer -- and the Supreme Court of California says this to the extent that the preference is on the basis of the race, we believe that it's an unconstitutional advantage."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5420.072,5428.137,But do you say then that it is not a permissible goal on the part of the University to increase the number of black doctors practicing?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5428.137,5433.256,We say it is a permissible goal and if --
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5433.256,5438.438,"If it's a permissible goal, why on earth beat around the bush?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5441.8,5448.824,"Because the University -- because the Supreme Court says to the University, you cannot lead to the quota system."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5456.251,5461.66,"But the University comes back and says we're not interested in disadvantaged as such, we're interested in blacks."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5461.66,5468.134,"Yes, but the Supreme Court comes back to the University and says what you are doing is skipping one step."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5594.057,5598.344,"Your client did compete for the 84 seats, didn't he?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5598.344,5599.009,"Yes, he did."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5599.009,5599.875,And he lost.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5599.875,5600.981,"Yes, he did."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5600.981,5610.507,Now would your argument be the same if one instead of 16 seats were left open?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5610.507,5615.453,"Most respectfully, the argument does not turn on the numbers."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5615.453,5617.628,Would -- my question is would you make the same --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5617.628,5621.414,"Yes, I would make."
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5629.849,5640.503,"I didn't say, anything about him being, I said that the regulation said that one seat would be left open for an underprivileged minority person?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5640.503,5641.302,Yes.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5641.302,5642.245,You would argue that?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5642.245,5645.622,We don't think we would -- we'd ever get to that point within any --
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5645.622,5647.608,So numbers are just not important.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5647.608,5649.906,The numbers are not important.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5655.969,5661.179,You're arguing about keeping somebody out and the other side is arguing by getting somebody in?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5661.179,5661.898,That's right.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5661.898,5664.03,"So it depends on which way you look at it, doesn't it?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5664.03,5666.093,It depends on which way you look at the problem.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5666.093,5667.022,It does?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5667.022,5667.382,The problem --
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5667.382,5669.456,It does?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5669.456,5669.91,If I may finish.
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5669.91,5670.826,It does?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5670.826,5672.266,The problem is --
1979.76-811,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5672.266,5677.039,"You're talking about your client's rights, don't these underprivileged people have some rights?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5677.039,5684.242,"They certainly have the rights to compete to -- they have the right to compete, they have the right to equal competition."
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5729.297,5732.189,May I ask you a question that I think is relevant to your last statement.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5732.189,5733.332,Yes.
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5733.332,5740.935,The case before us involves essentially a two-track admission system with separate committees.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5792.108,5803.976,Our argument would be the same to the extent -- to the extent that race itself was the crucial matter in the admission situation.
1979.76-811,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5803.976,5819.056,My hypothetical listed race as one of eight or ten factors or elements that a committee might fairly waive in the interest of diversity of the student body for example.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5822.068,5840.089,"In our opinion -- in our opinion, at this point in the California situation, with the rule of the Supreme Court before it, Supreme Court of California that race itself is an improper ground for selection or rejection for the medical school."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5908.577,5924.311,"Well, I take it if we -- if we didn't agree with the California Supreme Court on the federal issue, and reverse them, I take it you would pursue the other grounds that you had in the California Supreme Court, the state grounds and the federal statute ground."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5924.311,5927.511,May I just say a word about the record on that.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5983.544,5984.541,On all those grounds.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5984.541,5985.64,On all of those grounds.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5985.64,5988.494,"Now, where those grounds all taken to the Supreme Court of California?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,5988.494,6002.496,"There were all -- there were all probably attention to the Supreme Court of California, it is true that by that time, the University had written a brief basically under the Fourteenth Amendment and it is true that the California Court ignored and elected not to."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6002.496,6012.542,"Well, they ignored it but if we reverse the California Supreme Court on the federal -- on the ground that it did decide, what would be the upshot in the California Supreme Court?"
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6022.65,6064.542,"My own judgment if I may be so bold is that that becomes almost an idle act because if the basis of reversal is telling the California Court, look at this from the point of view of 2000 (d) or look at this from the point of view of the privileges and immunities clause of the California Constitution then and I say this respectfully and without having the stature to make this statement, I say respectfully that as I read the Fourteenth Amendment and I read 2000 (d), it seems to me that 2000 (d) is even stronger than any --"
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6064.542,6081.55,"I think it's certainly possible that the Fourteenth Amendment wouldn't -- might permit or wouldn't forbid what Congress could forbid in the statute and Congress has often done that and it -- technically, it could be that that the Civil Rights Act forbids things that the Fourteenth Amendment itself wouldn't."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6081.55,6082.123,Yes.
1979.76-811,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6082.123,6088.03,Are you asking us then Mr. Colvin to decide the federal statutory grounds?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6088.03,6089.893,I'm asking this Court to decide.
1979.76-811,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6089.893,6093.615,"Well we can't -- obviously, we can't pass on the state constitution."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6093.615,6094.353,I understand that.
1979.76-811,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6094.353,6096.478,"Well, I'm asking you then yes or no."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6099.08,6108.656,We believe that this case is right and ready for decision on the constitutional ground and on the statutory ground.
1979.76-811,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6110.529,6122.213,"Well, ordinarily, we don't decide constitutional questions if we can affirm which is what you ask us to do on a federal statutory ground."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6122.213,6133.878,I understand that Justice Brennan and I am -- I am not at any point in this argument attempting to place myself where I do not belong and that is at the decision making.
1979.76-811,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6133.878,6135.044,But all you're asking us --
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6135.044,6165.999,"I am asking this Court to affirm the California Supreme Court on both grounds and I am suggesting to the Court, I am suggesting to the Court, I am suggesting to the Court that the California Supreme Court had before it as have been indicated by Mr. Cox a very difficult sensitive issue that it handled it in a very pragmatic and a very practical and valuable sense."
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6170.982,6181.63,Do you think it's arguable that the California Supreme Court should have decided the statutory question for reaching the constitutional question?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6181.63,6184.082,I've heard that argument made.
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6184.939,6189.784,And you think it's been pressed today except that our inquiries are aimed at it.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6189.784,6192.429,"Yes, I've heard that argument made."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6208.872,6210.312,Can I ask you one more question?
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6232.619,6234.924,I suppose that there were new case that that would come up.
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6257.888,6258.724,Thank you.
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6258.724,6272.414,"Mr. Colvin, my brother Powell a moment ago asked you a question suggesting that a university's admission policy took into effect, took into account a number of considerations, one of which was race."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6294.048,6307.083,"In my judgment, the use of race as a basis for admission to a medical school or the exercise of other rights is an improper measure, that is my answer to the question."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6307.083,6309.392,Whether crucial or not.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6309.392,6335.762,"Whether crucial or not except in this situation and that is to the extent, to the extent that the identification of race may give further inquiry to the admissions committee as to whether there has been actual disadvantaged economic educational persecution or whatever but then the decision is to be made on those factors and not the factor of race itself."
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6336.462,6345.104,"Well, if it increase -- if taking race into account increases a person's chance of getting in, it's inevitable whether it's going to be crucial at some point."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6345.104,6345.79,That was --
1979.76-811,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6345.79,6346.497,Or at any point.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6346.497,6348.393,I think that was the answer that I made.
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6374.132,6386.578,I think you had argued earlier that this record shows that race -- this was your argument at least that race was the dispositive factor here.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6386.578,6387.963,"Yes, that's our argument."
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6387.963,6392.144,"I think you said, I think the Regents agreed with that."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6396.493,6405.729,I don't think I said that because I know of no record that there was an explicit approval by the Regents of this system at the day it was --
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6405.729,6409.773,"Well, when I say the Regents, I mean, your adversary."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6409.773,6410.006,Oh!
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6410.25,6413.036,I'm identifying the regents as such.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6413.036,6433.948,"Yes, and what we are saying in that regard -- what we are saying in that regard that on the facts of this case, there was no non-minority person in any of the years covered by the statistics here that was ever admitted to the special admission program."
1979.76-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6529.992,6540.115,The University stipulated after the judgment of the Supreme Court of California didn't that it could not sustain the burden of proof and if he would have not been admitted under a different system.
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6540.115,6541.965,"Yes, that is true."
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6729.615,6731.308,"Your time is now expired, Mr. Colvin."
1979.76-811,2,38990,reynold_h_colvin,,6731.308,6733.023,Thank you very much.
1979.76-811,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6733.023,6734.509,"Mr. Cox, do you have something further?"
1979.76-811,3,15704,archibald_cox,,6734.509,6735.574,Chief Justice.
1979.76-811,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6735.574,6749.83,"Mr. Cox, before you commence your argument, may I inquire whether you agree with my understanding of the Solicitor General's position that it is -- the record is inadequate for the constitutional decision and should be remanded?"
1979.76-811,3,15704,archibald_cox,,6749.83,6751.169,I do not agree.
1979.76-811,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7017.275,7024.168,You wouldn't say that if the admissions committee suddenly decided that they wouldn't admit any black people.
1979.76-811,3,15704,archibald_cox,,7024.168,7041.837,"No, but I'm suggesting that the details to which I was addressing myself where of a different order of magnitude, you have to decide whether we are right in saying that race may be taken into account for proper purposes, of course you will."
1979.76-811,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7148.044,7148.907,Thank you gentlemen.
