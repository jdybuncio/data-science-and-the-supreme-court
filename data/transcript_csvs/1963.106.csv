1963.106,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,40.825,"Number 106, Compco Corporation, Petitioner, versus Day-Brite Lighting, Incorporated."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,41.885,47.114,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court.
1963.106,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,86.368,88.163,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,88.163,90.063,"Yes, sir, except for this."
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,643.433,649.308,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,649.308,649.963,No sir.
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,649.963,650.436,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,650.436,651.611,I -- I'd --
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,651.611,658.838,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,658.838,659.916,Yes.
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,682.961,691.462,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,691.462,691.723,"Yes, sir."
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,691.723,692.297,Is that right?
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,692.297,693.601,That's right.
1963.106,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,703.962,709.028,(Inaudible)
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,709.028,711.683,That's right.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.58,843.89,Mr. Fallon.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,843.89,844.026,Yes sir?
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,844.026,865.188,"Do I understand from what you've told us so far and particularly right now, that you're whole case depends upon the fact, and it is a fact, that the respondent had a design patent which protected it for some five years in this case?"
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,865.188,867.679,I would hate to argue the case without that.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,921.259,943.458,"Well, if the respondent in this case had never applied for a design patent and -- and nonetheless sued you in the District Court and let's assume, diversity jurisdiction for unfair competition and hadn't prevailed under the law of unfair competition of Illinois."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,943.458,944.299,"Yes, sir."
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.299,947.05,"You'd have quite a different case, wouldn't you?"
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,947.05,953.081,He'd been very hard put because there were no cases in Illinois that have anything to do with this.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.431,1002.475,"Well now the respondent did prevail, of course, in his unfair competition claim in this case."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1002.475,1003.379,"That's right, Your Honor."
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.379,1007.884,And then the court purport to be applying an Illinois law or a federal law --
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1007.884,1008.35,Illinois.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.35,1008.858,-- or just some federal law.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1008.858,1009.799,Illinois law.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1010.145,1010.925,Illinois law.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1010.925,1011.636,That's right.
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.636,1018.093,"So, when you say, he would've been hard put to prevail, that's contrary to what happened in this case, isn't it?"
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1031.608,1051.015,"Except that the telling testimony, I don't think, could have been adduced because, without a patent, if this had been the superior product that we admit that it was, a superior just to a certain extent, not enough to enjoy the patent status, he could not have kept others out of the field."
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.52,1078.09,"So -- so that brings us back, I suppose, to my original question."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1087.298,1087.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.707,1094.202,I see.
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1094.202,1097.016,Suppose there had been no patent.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1133.335,1135.894,"Let's see if I get your question, Mr. Justice Black, that --"
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1135.894,1139.111,But what I get is -- what's -- what I'm talking about is this.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1171.598,1174.585,That would be the law of unfair competition.
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1174.585,1178.954,"Well, unfair competition, what he was doing."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1181.522,1181.818,"Yes, aggravate --"
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1181.818,1188.015,It seems to me -- it seems to me that your petition for certiorari may be stated a little better than you have.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1201.312,1207.537,"But, in my presentation here I was relying upon the aggravated situation of the fact that the patent had been in effect."
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1207.537,1211.493,"Well, it shows -- it shows very clearly that they couldn't get a patent."
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1211.493,1211.663,But the --
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1211.663,1212.106,(Voice Overlap) it shows --
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1212.106,1212.494,But they --
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1212.494,1217.608,-- very clearly that they couldn't get the benefit of a monopoly through a patent.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1217.608,1218.595,Well --
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1218.595,1219.923,That -- it shows that.
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1219.923,1220.684,In -- in that respect --
1963.106,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1220.684,1227.716,"But it doesn't show -- that doesn't -- certainly it does, does it, whether they can get a monopoly under the states?"
1963.106,0,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,1242.392,1246.18,That to me is clearly improper as far as Illinois is concerned.
1963.106,1,37529,owne_j_ooms,,1526.506,1530.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices."
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3450.442,3455.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1963.106,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.511,3470.01,"Well, was that, a copyright or design patent?"
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3470.01,3470.877,Copyright.
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3473.453,3474.345,Was not a design patent?
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3474.345,3475.457,Not a design patent.
1963.106,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3594.878,3605.434,(Inaudible)
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3605.434,3609.82,But here we're talking -- let's get back to the Coke bottle in contrast to this.
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3637.494,3642.322,"Suppose I could sell eau de cologne in -- in Coke bottles, couldn't I?"
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3647.692,3656.86,That's a difficult question to ask in view of the holding in Illinois because certain states still say that there has to be direct competition.
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3670.489,3671.676,"Well, there is some relation."
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3671.676,3678.377,That -- may -- maybe yours is far enough away that we wouldn't do that.
1963.106,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3747.055,3749.652,"(Inaudible) case, there was confusion, you tell me."
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3749.652,3756.889,Because some workman decided that he should call up Day-Brite rather than Compco to come and repair these fixtures.
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3774.655,3776.287,"That evidence doesn't help you, does it?"
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3776.287,3776.908,"No, it doesn't."
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3776.908,3777.297,Yes.
1963.106,2,30229,jerome_f_fallon,,3777.297,3780.664,"But, on the other hand, that is the only instance of confusion."
1963.106,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3790.137,3801.714,"Who was -- who was then, presumably, a sophisticated expert in his -- in this limited area?"
1963.106,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3801.714,3803.584,Apparently not.
