2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 11-982, Already, LLC, d/b/a YUMS v. Nike."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,9.572,13.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,73.096,97.497,"If -- if I were to write an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here because distributors and retailers will see that there's been this suit against the -- your client and they will be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just make that up, or is there something I can read to find out -- find that out, or--"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,97.497,104.483,"Injury in fact is a question of fact, and injury in fact is based on evidence."
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,104.483,112.071,"--Well, the evidence here was that they did need investors, and investors were reluctant."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,112.071,112.906,That's correct.
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.906,116.041,"It wasn't specific evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,116.041,119.41,There are three forms of injury in this case.
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,137.122,137.555,Okay.
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,138.539,139.491,--It certainly is.
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.631,155.75,"When you said it's incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in the record?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,155.75,159.404,That specific statement is not in the record.
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.404,166.558,"I mean, it makes sense, but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice of the shoe business."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,167.041,177.699,"Your Honor, I'm glad you brought that up, because under the mootness doctrine, the burden of proof on that and every other fact relevant to mootness fell on the respondent."
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,193.641,195.093,"You're right, that's the standard."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,263.805,272.76,--Page 173A of the record of the Joint Appendix states that the petitioner is intending -- is regularly engaged in the design of new footwear.
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.76,274.177,"Yes, but that isn't the point."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,304.299,310.868,"Your Honor, in the real world, a business competitor--"
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,310.868,312.302,"No, I'm not interested in the real world."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,313.737,326.378,--The record does not show that the petitioner lacks any concrete interest in entering the line of commerce that--
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,326.378,342.757,And does it show anything at all in respect that would support the claim that you are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either resemble nor is a colorable imitation of anything that you have previously produced or is the subject of the case?
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,342.757,355.247,"--Your Honor, what the record shows, and it is what it is, is that the petitioner is actively engaged in designing and bringing out new footwear products--"
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.247,355.981,Period?
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,355.981,356.664,--Period.
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,356.664,357.183,Okay.
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,382.715,407.097,"We would respectfully submit that when you apply the mootness doctrine, since we're not talking about picking a fight here, we're talking about someone who was sued once -- once bitten, twice shy -- that when someone has been sued for alleged infringement has asked for a judgment that would eliminate any need to think about whether or not a new shoe will attract--"
2012.11-982,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.097,424.042,"Yes, and I assume that was your point, that you shouldn't be put through the trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or are not."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,425.244,425.894,--Exactly.
2012.11-982,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.894,426.261,--right?
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,426.261,426.794,Exactly.
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.794,449.109,"--And I would think that you would add this as well, that for a competitor to demand that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing, is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably quite injurious in and of itself."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,449.109,450.309,That would itself be--
2012.11-982,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.309,457.197,"But again, there's -- do I just know that because I'm a judge, or is there someplace I can look for that?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,457.197,487.734,"--The law is that as I stand here today, the government has registered a claim that the petitioner is duty bound not to bring out the shoe shown in the registration, number one, which according to the respondent is one of the best selling, most profitable shoe styles of all time; and also, as I stand here today, the law is that petitioner is at risk if it brings out a shoe that is going to be giving rise to a plausible claim--"
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.734,508.129,"But, Mr. Dabney, are you saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no good unless it says that you will never be sued for any shoe that you ever produce?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,514.634,523.823,--I'm saying that the respondent bore the burden of proving that the covenant completely and irrevocably eradicated all the facts.
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.823,545.987,"So -- if -- if you are uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate protection, it should be amended, and then say what you think you need to be adequately covered?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,545.987,555.961,"Because the petitioner asks for judgment in accordance with law, and it would prefer not to be the involuntary licensee of the respondent that sued it."
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,555.961,581.844,"Well, does that mean that if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-a-vis your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with respect to this design; would that be enough for you?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,581.844,583.946,"Your Honor, again--"
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.946,585.648,I know you want to help everybody else--
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,585.648,586.364,--Not -- no--
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.364,587.181,--but why wouldn't that be--
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,587.181,588.682,--That's -- that's not actually right.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,606.761,616.333,"You get a lot of what this extra stuff, you know, that you say, well, even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me for that, there's all the collateral damage."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,625.956,632.026,"--Your Honor, the covenant actually reasserts the allegation that these shoes infringe."
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.128,636.463,Where does it -- where does it do that?
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,636.463,651.59,"--It says it right on the -- on page, I believe it is 96 of the record where it says, in the second whereas,"
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,660.396,660.846,Okay.
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,665.183,671.253,--There would be one small little less bit of injury in this case.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,672.169,675.287,"Well, I guess maybe this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,691.214,693.598,--When someone seeks--
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.598,695.784,"No, no, that's kind of a yes or no answer."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,700.902,701.938,--No.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.938,702.538,No.
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.538,703.238,--So--
2012.11-982,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,703.238,703.904,But why?
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,703.904,704.487,--what you're saying is you--
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.487,714.926,"So you're saying that in this case there's no way -- I mean, I thought it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties to grant covenants of this sort."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,717.395,720.264,The practice in this case dates to 1995.
2012.11-982,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,730.888,732.605,"But that's not the question, Mr. Dabney."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,747.897,764.709,"--The reason is, Your Honor, that the registration causes informational injury, and what the respondent is trying to do is to hang on to government action that disadvantages its competitor while--"
2012.11-982,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.709,782.504,"--But I don't know why -- but my solution was that they would give you a covenant that I suggested as a possibility that would say, vis-a-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this design, only vis-a-vis you."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,795.58,814.126,"--The question the trademark practitioners get asked every day is whether something is available, and so long as that question is asked, a covenant that's in the file of a company is not going to prevent deception and confusion of people who look and say, oh, this is a protected design."
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.126,817.827,"Mr. Dabney, that's a different answer than the one you gave me when I asked the same question."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,824.664,829.301,"That is a second form of injury that we have now, as Justice Scalia pointed out."
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.991,845.311,"But can you -- can you just explain to me, you've given a name to this carte blanche that -- that Nike would give you."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,855.536,872.847,--What we've substituted is instead of getting a judgment in accordance with law that expunges the allegedly invalid government-registered claim of right to exclude competition and sale of goods in favor of the chance to litigate with our arch rival to see whether they will prove--
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,872.847,876.532,Then you're going back to saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,876.532,883.453,--A covenant that leaves the covenantor in possession of the unreviewed government benefit that it got--
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.453,895.328,"I mean, maybe you could suggest to me that we should change what the law has been or not follow it here, but where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,895.328,895.78,--Yes.
2012.11-982,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.78,910.02,"And in Friends of the Earth it says a defendant, namely Nike, claiming its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, moots the case, the covenant they gave."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,958.584,966.107,The claim the counterclaim seeks to extinguish is not simply the particular rights of action that they have covenanted not to exert.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,977.229,977.998,Mr. Dabney--
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,977.998,978.398,Yes.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.398,986.334,"--if you had the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're not talking about mootness, but we're talking about Article III standing."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,986.334,987.436,Yes.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.436,991.405,"I'm looking at what you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce particular shoes."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1005.063,1008.848,I would say we have very distinct and concrete and palpable injury in that--
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.848,1013.318,"Just because you plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can bring a lawsuit?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1013.318,1015.186,--No.
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1015.186,1015.72,No.
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1023.607,1035.582,"It is undeniable by law that the petitioner's cost of operation, the petitioner's risk of operation is increased because of--"
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.582,1037.834,"Well, that surely would not establish Article III standings."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1045.473,1052.46,"--Yes, but we're a direct competitor which we say is currently subject to an unlawful restraint on our freedom to operate."
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1052.46,1077.094,"Mr. Dabney, suppose there had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but you're in the shoe business and you're worried, could you have brought a declaratory action or an action for an injunction to have the trademark declared invalid?"
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1077.094,1086.367,"When our shoes were launched, it obviously never even occurred to the petitioner that they could be deemed an infringement of any rights of this respondent."
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.209,1109.982,So you say you could not have brought a suit to cancel?
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1109.982,1115.017,The three-part test of injury-in-fact is universally applicable.
2012.11-982,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.098,1147.321,"But if that's the case, if the difference is that you've been sued, then it should be adequate protection if you know that you won't be sued again, and that's why there's the question of what kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that you won't be sued again."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1147.321,1168.002,"If the, as I said before, if the only injury we were complaining about and trying to extinguish was the injury that flows from being sued again by this respondent, then I suppose you could -- you could conceive of a covenant that would extinguish that injury."
2012.11-982,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1187.732,1194.719,"But, Mr. Dabney, you told me you could not bring such an independent suit, you have to be stoned once."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1211.614,1212.248,"Well, let me clarify."
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1231.81,1232.81,"No, I suggest it might not."
2012.11-982,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1232.81,1233.744,"--Might not, that's right."
2012.11-982,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.825,1255.858,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1263.431,1265.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.783,1304.258,"Ms. Anders, what -- there is a question about why a competitor should have to produce to its competition its future plans of development."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1332.591,1346.851,"Well, once the -- once the defendant offers the covenant, then the question becomes whether there is anything that the plaintiff is intending to do, its current activities or its concrete plans for anticipated activities that would fall outside the covenant and potentially be infringing."
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1349.72,1350.853,"Well, then what did--"
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1350.853,1357.475,"Could we say there is just a presumption that if you're in the business that you probably are interested in future design, period?"
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1357.475,1361.677,--I don't think that -- I don't think that presumption would establish a concrete interest.
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.744,1363.596,Wouldn't establish a--
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1363.596,1366.248,--It would not establish that the plaintiff has a concrete interest.
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1375.437,1381.508,"--I read this affidavit as saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make new shoes regularly."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1409.008,1416.431,"--I think what they have to do is they have to state that they intend to make products that may be outside the covenant, and now--"
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1416.431,1418.883,But saying it is enough?
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1424.787,1428.322,--I think the -- the affidavit says that they intend to produce new shoes as a general matter.
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.993,1435.976,"Please, now go back to my question."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1454.889,1457.258,--I think that could depend on the breadth of the covenant.
2012.11-982,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1464.745,1465.595,I agree with you.
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1465.595,1479.671,"So I also think that it may depend -- the less far along a party's plans are to make its shoes, the easier it will be for the defendant to say it is speculative that your plans will actually mature into something that doesn't--"
2012.11-982,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1479.671,1485.491,"Well, Ms. Anders, take this case where Already says, you know, we're not really going to say anything particular."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1494.364,1495.597,--I think that's right.
2012.11-982,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1522.164,1526.418,"Given what Already has said in this case, why is it that you think that we should remand?"
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1534.424,1535.641,I think there are two reasons.
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1559.04,1570.931,"--But its future -- its future shoes are clearly, and I thought the counsel for the Petitioner might have added this in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future shoes are not covered by this."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1583.322,1589.476,--I think that would be one way for Nike to try to establish that the dispute is not reasonably likely to recur.
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1590.678,1595.813,So then the covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no other manufacturer has.
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1595.813,1597.499,--I don't think it does give the--
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.499,1606.037,"Do you mean any manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you thinking about?"
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1606.037,1612.424,"--Well, once Already produces -- once Already identifies what its future activities may be -- and, again--"
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.424,1614.626,But why should Already have to do that to anybody?
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1614.626,1631.838,"--Well, we think it makes sense for Already to have to -- have to at least identify here what activities it thinks may not be outside the covenant, and I don't think that hurts Already, and the reason is that if Already's evidence convinces the court that the case isn't moot, then Already gets its adjudication on the related--"
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1631.838,1635.79,So Nike has an advantage over Already that no other manufacturers had.
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1637.909,1645.912,"--Well, it will get -- the trademark will be adjudicated if Already convinces the Court the action isn't--"
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.912,1650.633,"Let me just ask one question on that, and it's a little bit off of what we've been talking about."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1691.376,1692.61,"--Well, a couple of points on that."
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.149,1702.934,That was a big part of your argument.
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1705.553,1726.966,"--What we're proposing here is that as a function of the Court's broader discussion under the Declaratory Judgment Act and United States v. W. T. Grant is that when the Court believes that it probably does have jurisdiction but it doesn't think that the likelihood of a dispute is -- is really that great, that in that situation it can discretionarily dismiss."
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.251,1742.659,"My -- my question is, is the Article III requirement that Already has the same in this case as it would be if they sought judicial review from an adverse order of the administrative agency?"
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1742.659,1749.047,"--The administrative agency's standing rules are broader than Article III, so it would -- it is easier to get--"
2012.11-982,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.047,1750.332,I'm talking about going to court.
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1750.332,1764.139,"--And so once it goes to court, there may be rare cases in which Already, as the party that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's decision itself, that it would not have the necessary Article III injury to seek judicial review."
2012.11-982,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.614,1787.522,"Ms. Anders, you did say, if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as the preferred form for cancellation proceedings."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1813.172,1827.432,"Well, I think Congress didn't set it up as an exhaustion requirement, so I don't think it's that Congress preferred for all of these claims to go to the TTAB, but the TTAB is the expert body that -- that adjudicates cancellation of validity issues all the time."
2012.11-982,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.578,1865.874,"I thought your answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you is an additional injury, in fact, that gives you Article III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the agency's decision is you don't have any injury."
2012.11-982,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1865.874,1874.996,"I think there could be some circumstances in which the TTAB's decision would create injury-in-fact if it said something about the scope of the trademark, something like that."
2012.11-982,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1880.134,1880.984,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1883.768,1886.553,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much."
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1936.269,1944.624,"How do you deal with the point that's been discussed with your adversary, they have to show you everything they intend to produce?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1948.092,1948.861,--Absolutely.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.977,2002.163,What if they simply said--
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2002.163,2002.679,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2002.679,2007.215,"--you have the trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your shoe?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2016.404,2016.923,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.923,2019.323,Would that be enough of a showing?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2034.8,2037.234,"The answer to your question is going to be yes, but it has two parts to it."
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.377,2084.817,"Mr. Goldstein, how the case came to us, how this case originated was a counterclaim."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2084.817,2085.483,--Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.483,2094.839,"And at the time the counterclaim was asserted there was certainly Article III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2094.839,2096.375,That's absolutely right.
2012.11-982,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2132.714,2136.333,Do you that this covenant covers an exact copy of your shoe?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2136.333,2137.216,It does not.
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2149.509,2156.329,"Is -- is -- is the petitioner -- do you anticipate that the petitioner will agree with you, that this covers future products?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2156.329,2166.518,"--Yes, because although the cert petition says that it doesn't, we have quite stridently pointed out in our briefing that that was completely inaccurate."
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2216.034,2224.389,The colorful imitations -- colorable imitations are colorable imitations of their shoe?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2224.389,2225.323,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.323,2231.127,You haven't promised to not sue them over colorable imitations of your shoe?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2231.127,2232.593,That are not colorable imitations--
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2232.593,2234.745,But you have two categories.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2242.518,2243.518,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.518,2248.172,"So it -- so it -- so it does cover some future designs, and they're correct about that and you're incorrect."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2248.172,2250.957,"Justice Kennedy, I -- I may have confused things."
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.599,2294.118,So it's -- so it's a question of -- of deficiency in their pleading.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2307.293,2307.827,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2334.477,2340.714,"But suppose in a different hypothetical case they had said, what we want to do is to copy Nike's shoes--"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2340.714,2341.164,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2341.164,2343.666,"--what then should have happened then, in your view?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2343.666,2344.15,Okay.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.783,2372.1,Why?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2387.612,2388.512,--That's correct.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2388.512,2398.318,So why would you abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount to abandonment of your mark?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2398.318,2398.685,Okay.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.37,2429.872,What is it -- I would like to know.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2439.212,2439.928,--Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.928,2450.869,"--or that might, which does not look at all like the present -- your present shoe, and isn't even colorably like your present shoe, do you have a plan to do such a thing, are you in the process, is it likely?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2455.506,2455.973,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.973,2459.475,"But if they were to say, you know, we make new shoes all the time--"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2459.475,2459.891,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.891,2468.247,"--and this is some kind of thing we might well consider, and we have people working on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not, it's well in the works -- they win."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2470.433,2473.218,Page 173 of the Joint Appendix.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2482.657,2485.543,I'm making this as simple as I can.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2485.543,2485.909,--Okay.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2485.909,2488.478,I'm a shoe manufacturer.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2493.881,2494.598,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2494.598,2496.75,If this mark isn't validated--
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2496.75,2497.183,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2497.183,2500.368,--I intend to copy as much of it as I can.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2500.368,2500.718,Sure.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2500.718,2505.404,I don't have any records of doing the planning because the trademark was there.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2505.404,2505.772,Sure.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2505.772,2511.058,"But for sure, given my current shoe--"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2511.058,2511.51,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2511.51,2515.128,--and the fact that they thought I imitated them--
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2515.128,2515.545,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2515.545,2517.914,--meaning you--
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2517.914,2518.264,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2518.264,2522.716,"--you invalidate the mark, I'm going to copy as much of it as I can."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2522.716,2523.032,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2523.032,2524.318,Would that be enough?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2524.318,2524.718,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2524.718,2525.451,In your mind you're saying--
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2525.451,2526.534,"Yes, that would be fine."
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2526.534,2527.534,--You could do discovery then?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2527.534,2527.851,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2528.903,2530.369,And the discovery is going to show what?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2530.369,2531.019,--Well--
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2531.019,2534.89,The president comes in and says exactly what I said.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2536.773,2537.259,--They're going to win.
2012.11-982,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.714,2550.882,"Counsel, could you go back to Justice Breyer's question and answer that?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2550.882,2551.399,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.817,2578.35,--Yes.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2579.419,2590.393,"--So these paragraphs do not say -- they do not suggest, they do not imply, even between the lines, an intention to make something that is outside the covenant."
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.259,2595.945,What they say is that they changed this at the rate of a mile a minute.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2626.149,2626.517,--Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.517,2635.088,"So you say, okay, this is the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this; you seem to have conducted this case without that standard quite in mind."
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2648.313,2650.515,I thought what they were arguing--
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.515,2651.098,--What about that?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2652.884,2653.2,Okay.
2012.11-982,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.1,2656.252,Answer Justice Breyer's question.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.252,2656.602,Excellent.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2656.602,2658.119,"--All right, Justice Breyer, so you've got a choice."
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2661.054,2663.623,"Well, that's your opinion, that you will win on remand."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2663.923,2666.058,Okay.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.367,2708.019,"I would ask Nike, I suppose, Nike could say, you know, I read the page 73 and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean and they're sort of like our shoe but we didn't think enough, but you did think enough, and are some of these changes that could happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to think, you know, that they won't look really colorably even like what you just did, but nonetheless is a pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our present trademark."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2708.019,2708.97,Justice Breyer--
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.97,2711.186,"That's a long question, I don't know if I'll get a good answer."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2711.186,2712.688,"--Well, I hope you'll get a good answer."
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.829,2789.237,"Mr. Goldstein, can you inform us of when this practice of the unilateral covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim, when -- how long has it been around?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2789.237,2794.206,--It is still -- it has been around for at least 20 years.
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2827.045,2828.63,That's because it usually sues.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2851.643,2854.309,"We -- Justice Kennedy, we do enforce our trademarks."
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.053,2896.922,"Well, but that's because you gave them the covenant after you sued them."

2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.265,3025.871,"And your response, I took it, to that was there are procedures that deal with that, they're called protective orders, and so is that -- have I got that right with your argument?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3025.871,3027.254,You could not -- you could not be more right.
2012.11-982,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.254,3028.906,"That's what your argument is, yes."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3028.906,3034.81,It's also the truth that -- that it is what happens in every single patent and trademark invalidity case.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.797,3046.367,"Mr. Goldstein, what about Federal Rule 41(a)(2)?"
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3076.637,3077.57,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.57,3102.287,"So on the face of it, it seems that that rule fits this case to a T; that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, defendant objects, and the question is can the counterclaim remain pending for independent adjudication."
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3102.287,3102.637,Yes.
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3141.579,3145.881,You -- you referred just in a fleeting way to the fact that they can go to the PTO and to the board.

2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3149.935,3150.618,"No, I understand--"
2012.11-982,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3150.618,3151.602,--I didn't quite understand the government's petition.
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3159.791,3162.41,--The Chief Justice suggested an argument that could be made.
2012.11-982,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.096,3221.781,May I interject just one thing that I would like you to clarify?
2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3236.391,3237.674,"That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-982,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3343.16,3350.833,"--You are saying that you've met -- if we decide you bear the burden of proof, you're saying, you -- you could live with that."

2012.11-982,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3354.551,3361.355,Our burden was met by our submission of the covenant which dealt with every product they're making and every colorable imitation in the future of it.
2012.11-982,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.996,3372.512,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3374.614,3418.06,"Your Honor, the covenant -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about five weeks after this completely unexpected development in the middle of a hard pressed litigation was made, and the position that the Petitioner made to the district court was there is obviously subject matter jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41 point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that raises these three issues, you could, say, enter a single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are waived because they've waived them, the trademark is invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and should be granted."
2012.11-982,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3475.614,3492.441,"His challenge, you said to have a chance in three different courts to say directly and unequivocally if the mark is invalid, we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to do that."
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3492.441,3501.797,"--Your Honor, the Petitioner has been trying now for two and a half years to establish its right to do that."
2012.11-982,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3516.324,3517.607,What's your commercial interest?
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3517.607,3525.33,--The commercial interest is to partake of this very large and lucrative business that the Respondent's evidence shows in this case.
2012.11-982,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3525.33,3528.449,So are you willing to make the statement he's asked you for?
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3537.054,3546.426,"I -- I think it is -- first of all, the Petitioner, up until now, has said what he said."
2012.11-982,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3560.503,3560.87,Okay.
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3590.855,3603.68,"The practical problem here is that in the procedural posture of this case, which is analogous to a summary judgment situation, all inferences, all reasonable inferences need to be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party."
2012.11-982,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3656.964,3657.63,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-982,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3658.713,3658.963,--Thank you.
