1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,46.656,50.111,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.93,128.463,And that's a one-shot proposition under Wisconsin law?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,128.463,129.275,One pay period.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,133.671,134.304,But that's all?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,135.628,135.783,That's right.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,135.783,137.529,Right under the same underlying claim?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,137.529,138.006,That's right.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.735,142.062,Yes.
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,142.062,144.288,After the termination of the principal action.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,144.288,146.691,"Well, the sum total is this $31.00 or $32.00."
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,146.691,147.796,That's correct.
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,147.796,152.61,You mean the employer is perfectly free to have paid them for the next pay period?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,152.61,159.663,"That's correct and indeed, the employer pays her a subsistence allowance which in this case, was also $31.59."
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.663,165.85,But if she goes on -- if the employee goes on working the next pay period --
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,165.85,167.005,She gets all $65.00.
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.005,171.837,She gets the whole and the creditor may not attach that also.
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,171.837,175.33,May not.
1968.130,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,258.822,269.447,"Does the Act of Congress last year affect, in any way, future cases of this kind?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,269.447,272.2,"Not on this issue, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1968.130,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,276.199,278.315,"I know it doesn't apply here, but I was thinking of --"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,278.315,288.474,You may not be discharged for one garnishment and it limits the amount of pay to be garnished to 25%.
1968.130,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,291.343,296.343,"But they wouldn't be, in the future, able to garnishee as much as they did here?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,296.343,296.775,That's correct.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.248,310.531,It's -- the new federal law is limited 25% of what?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,310.531,312.132,25% of --
1968.130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.132,315.484,"Weekly wages, isn't it?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,315.484,317.554,25% disposable income.
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.554,321.846,"That would be a great deal more than was the garnishee here, wouldn't it?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,324.233,327.579,"Yes, but they can only take 25% of the $65.00, assuming all 65."
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.579,331.802,If they can keep taking it so far as the new federal law does.
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,331.802,332.337,I think for the --
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.337,332.692,Yes.
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,332.692,332.874,Up to the amount --
1968.130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.874,334.289,"So, it should be a great deal more."
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.697,599.058,"Would your case reach getting jurisdiction by attachment or garnishment, quasi in rem equity?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,599.058,599.922,"Well, our position --"
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.922,602.104,"Suppose your position would have to, wouldn't it?"
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,602.104,608.056,Our position would go that far as to an entirely domestic situation.
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.761,622.263,Even though it's settled without notice as his deprived of equality?
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,622.263,628.429,"Well, I frankly would have some considerable -- Ownbey against Morgan never left me feeling very comfortable, Mr. Justice White."
1968.130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.72,638.491,I don't think the due process argument you make would be difficult to distinguish.
1968.130,0,30407,jack_greenber,,638.491,653.032,"I would say so, and -- but the justification given in Ownbey, that of the great antiquity of foreign attachment as giving some substance to -- that it's valid under the Due Process Clause, I think some weight has to be given to that."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1448.767,1454.997,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1540.769,1543.801,What are the interest terms?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1543.801,1543.917,As to --
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1543.917,1546.989,"As of June 18, she signed a note for how much?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1546.989,1548.47,"For $1,800.00, Mr. Justice."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1548.47,1551.504,And how much cash did she get?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1551.504,1555.021,"Her actual cash was in the neighborhood of $1,560.00."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1555.021,1558.353,"So, you had an immediate discount of $240.00."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1558.353,1560.107,"That is right, over a three-year period."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1560.107,1562.304,What were the interest terms?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1562.304,1564.769,Interest is set by statute.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1564.769,1564.902,What's that?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1564.902,1570.339,It averages out over the entire length of around 12% to 14%.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1570.339,1572.576,What was it precisely?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1572.576,1572.786,I don't --
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1572.786,1576.537,"What the statute said, 2% per month on unpaid increments?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1576.537,1577.967,"No,no."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1610.647,1617.552,"Well, now, if she paid -- there was a discount, or whatever you want to call it, immediately of $200.00, and what did you say, $240.00?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1617.552,1619.166,Around 240 or 250.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1619.166,1623.644,"And then, what you said was 12% over what period of time?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1623.644,1626.248,Over -- I believe this was a three-year loan.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1626.248,1628.997,"You mean, 12% per anum?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1628.997,1631.5,"No, for the entire length of the contract."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1631.5,1634.508,"And that was figured on the $1,800.00 principal?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1634.508,1635.26,That is correct.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1635.26,1640.299,And which did it amount to when figured it on which she actually got?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1640.299,1645.961,"She got somewhere around $1,500.00 to $1,550.00."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1645.961,1649.317,How much was the interest rate fee on which she actually got?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1649.317,1651.507,"Her interest rate was figured on the $1,500.00."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1651.507,1653.827,I know that -- on the what?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1653.827,1656.742,On the amount that she actually got.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1656.742,1664.405,"When you said 12%, was that -- is 12% on the $1,560.00 or on the $1,800.00?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1664.405,1666.493,"On the $1,560.00."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1666.493,1667.532,I see.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1675.314,1676.677,Paid back on monthly installments.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1676.677,1683.854,Is there any recalculation of the interest depending on the unpaid balances?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1683.854,1690.985,"If she prepays, she is given a rebate on the unearned interest."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1692.769,1694.844,This is not prepayment I'm talking about.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1706.638,1710.18,"The record does not show that, Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.452,1860.518,Do I understand you to say that it's common practice for a small-loan company in Wisconsin to let somebody go two years without paying and not being bothered?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1860.518,1868.744,"Justice Marshall, I can -- it isn't -- I said it was normally somewhere between six months and two years."
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.488,1872.29,"Well, you say it's usually six months?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1872.29,1876.746,"On the average, six months to two years before a garnishment is put in."
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.034,1890.144,"Well, when an investigation was going on in Congress last year, didn't they invite Wisconsin to testify to that?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1890.144,1891.16,I don't believe anybody --
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.16,1891.457,They should have.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1891.457,1892.663,From the finance industry.
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.663,1895.451,They should have because it's different from other testimonies.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1895.451,1896.276,I realize that.
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1907.384,1910.914,What I -- I'd like to ask a question just to get this straight on my mind.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1917.12,1918.079,That is correct.
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1918.079,1923.519,"Then, you told us that the actual amount of money that she got was $1,500.00 something --"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1923.519,1926.518,"The $1,500.00 and some odd cents."
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1926.518,1931.817,"Yes, and that she was paying interest on only $1,500.00 and something."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1931.817,1932.769,"That's right, with the interest --"
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1932.769,1934.646,"Now, tell me why."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1943.263,1947.745,She is -- the interest is added onto the amount that she got.
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.574,1982.574,For the whole period?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,1982.574,1984.426,For the whole period.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1997.568,2017.287,"Well, on the basis of what you have said, she pays 12% on $1,500.00 and something, plus a re-payment of the total $1,800.00, that is to say $300.00, additional to the interest."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2017.287,2018.856,"No, no."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2020.336,2021.457,It's bound to be.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2024.29,2034.563,"In the note itself, which is not in record, which showed a principal amount $1,500.00, interest $300.00."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2044.843,2051.148,"Her payments are setup on the $1,800.00 basis?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2051.148,2061.327,"On the $1,800.00, the principal amount that she received plus the pre-computed for the entire length of the loan."
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2062.351,2064.998,When was it due?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2066.523,2095.735,"The loan was due, I believe it was, in three years, and the loan was made on September 2, 1964."
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2101.447,2103.564,How much installment was that?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2103.564,2113.409,"The installment payments were -- this alone, in question, was 30 months at $60.00 a month."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.513,2116.653,That's the principal or interest?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2116.653,2118.229,The principal interest.
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.256,2189.702,Hold on.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2191.788,2194.127,"You don't put them aside, except for this."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.127,2198.424,If they go on without notice and I would suppose --
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2198.424,2201.775,"Well, may I clarify this for you, Justice White?"
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.122,2303.285,"When in a garnishment, you'd normally just foreshow that it's not intangible."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2303.285,2307.652,"Well, a garnishment would be on a wages --"
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.652,2308.897,Bank accounts?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2308.897,2309.683,"Bank accounts, except --"
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.683,2311.563,Debts due?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2311.563,2318.513,"Debts due, you could but normally you would attach -- there's micro-seizures are going to attach on a debt due."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.513,2320.749,Do you usually attach bank accounts?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2320.749,2322.131,Garnishee on a bank account.
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.131,2323.56,"Well, that's just a debt due."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2323.56,2332.838,"That's a debt due, but I prefer an attachment on a debt due, of course, depending upon the amount."
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.838,2338.701,"Well, of all of these, which is the easiest, garnishment, for you?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2338.701,2341.051,"Well, the easiest --"
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.051,2343.466,"Well, you don't have to put up a bond."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2343.466,2345.008,"You don't have to put up a bond, but --"
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.008,2347.036,You don't have to give notice.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2347.036,2347.532,"Justice Marshall, let's carry it --"
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.532,2352.61,You just pay $3.50 and ask your secretary to fill out a piece of paper.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2352.61,2355.119,It isn't $3.50.
1968.130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.67,2387.516,"You mean, you spent $15.20 to get this $30.00?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2387.516,2390.687,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.687,2393.089,"Then, why did you do that?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2393.089,2408.238,"Well, after two-and-a half -- after over two years of attempting to get the money with numerous letters, my client instructed me to proceed with the garnishment because, voluntarily, Mrs. Sniadach wouldn't even bother to call or come in."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.238,2415.529,"But the -- she just decided if she could put up with losing $30.00, why, you haven't been very effective, have you?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2415.529,2417.416,That is correct.
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.416,2421.592,Except that her employer might be upset?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2421.592,2426.181,"No, we're not too concerned with the employer, quite frankly."
1968.130,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2482.025,2486.675,Doesn't the new Federal Act ban discharged?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2486.675,2489.047,"Yes, it bans discharge."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.434,2495.269,"That's just for one debt, discharging for one debt."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2495.269,2539.452,"Discharge for one debt, but the problem here is that when, normally, you have to resort to a garnishment, you have deepened a path to the door, either personally, telephone calls, or letters in an attempt to get a payment or something on the account rather than garnishee and, it's been my experience that if you have been doing this, God only knows how many other creditors are attempting to obtain the money, too, because, practically, these people don't only owe you, they owe others."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.452,2544.55,I suppose the cost of garnishing is added to the indebtedness of the --
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2544.55,2550.628,The actual outweigh of cost is chargeable to the debtor or defendant.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2566.476,2568.009,How long would it take you?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2574.9,2579.31,"Taking this situation here, I can state this."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2600.979,2602.055,"No, I don't mean that."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2607.26,2608.735,On this indebtedness?
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2608.735,2610.554,"Yes, as a practical matter."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2617.202,2647.004,"This action was instituted on Sep -- on November 16, 1966, assuming that I follow the minimum of eight days -- service within eight days of the date of issuance, which would mean that this action, both the principal and garnishment, would be returnable in the County Court or the Small Claim Court on the 24th day of November."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2666.357,2669.708,"So -- no, I'm -- in theory, then, you --"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2669.708,2670.249,"In theory, within 30 days --"
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2670.249,2690.783,"That's your Court's work, and as your Court's work out there, if you had decided to proceed to judgment before garnishment, you say before attachment, and before trying to collect through the employer, you could've gotten a judgment in anywhere to 8 to 24 days, is that what you're telling me?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2690.783,2696.807,"Well, normally, if you're saying just to start the principal action and forget the garnishment?"
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2696.807,2697.475,That's right.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2697.475,2699.592,"Normally, around 30 days."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2699.592,2700.528,30 days?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2700.528,2712.083,"Yes, there are exceptions if the -- because of illness of one of the presiding judges where you have to transfer calendars but, normally, 30 days."
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2722.301,2728.438,Does your note provide for attorney's fees for collection?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2728.438,2731.153,"Mr. Chief Justice, they do not."
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.132,2954.849,Does Wisconsin have procedures available to a judgment of creditor similar to garnishment or attachment?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2960.204,2960.625,"Then, I could've proc --"
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2960.625,2962.889,"Then, what remedies would Wisconsin give you?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2962.889,2965.123,I could have proceeded with a garnishment.
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2965.123,2966.83,With the same limitation?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,2969.372,2969.934,Yes.
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.888,3033.433,"But my question is, after your judgment creditor, what are your remedies given by Wisconsin?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3033.433,3036.393,One garnishment.
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.393,3040.146,Can't you keep serving garnishments every pay period after judgment?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3040.146,3045.108,Only if you have disposed of the previous garnishment.
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.162,3085.607,"So even after judgment, after you've got a judgment to the amount of your promissory note and you're trying to collect?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3085.607,3087.765,"That's right, you can garnishee."
1968.130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.765,3090.577,"Well, you can garnishee, but do you still have those limitations?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3090.577,3094.327,Still have those limitations.
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3146.886,3165.363,Garnishment -- the garnishment procedure is really a procedure by which creditors ensure the cooperation of the employer and see to it that the employee pays his debts.
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3168.016,3171.768,"No, I don't believe it is, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.130,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3195.548,3200.638,"Well, the return to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, I'm not clear about it."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3225.921,3234.001,"No, it only affects the wages due as of the date of service of the garnishment papers."
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3239.868,3254.531,"Well, what if you get -- what if you get a judgment for $1,000.00 against some man who's an employee and who's making a $100.00 a week, what are your legal rights as a judgment creditor against that judgment debtor?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3254.531,3281.194,"I can only levy -- I can institute a garnishment either with an execution or without an execution in the case of a judgment of a $1,000.00 where your garnishment cost are not $1,520.00, but every time you would issue a garnishment, you would have $30.00 involved because you have a filing fee."
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3290.474,3292.668,And then there would be an examination of the judgment debtor?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3292.668,3295.131,An examination of the judgment debtor.
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3296.772,3300.712,"Under my question, he's making -- he's got wages of a $100.00 a week."
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3300.712,3300.895,His wages --
1968.130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.895,3303.608,Can there be a compulsory assignment of a fraction of his wages?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3303.608,3308.106,"No, there is no such thing as a compulsory wage assignment in Wisconsin."
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3372.576,3378.129,"If you get a judgment in Wisconsin, can you file it as lien?"
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3378.129,3378.461,As to --
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3378.461,3381.539,Could it stand as a lien on the property of the man?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3381.539,3399.257,"If you have a judgment over $200.00, the judgment can be docketed, as we term it, and it then automatically becomes a lien against a property, which is only good if the equity in the property exceeds the $10,000 maximum."
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3403.759,3405.718,Is this real estate?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3405.718,3406.699,On real estate.
1968.130,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3406.699,3407.307,Real estate?
1968.130,1,41334,sheldon_d_frank,,3409.519,3418.631,"Personal property, there is outside of his household goods and furnishings and the wages on his exemption."
1968.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3426.316,3426.997,Thank you.
1968.130,2,30407,jack_greenber,,3428.833,3430.74,May I'd like to add just a word or two.
