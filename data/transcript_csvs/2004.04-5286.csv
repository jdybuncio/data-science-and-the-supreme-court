2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.994,"We'll hear argument next in No. 04-5286, Michael Dodd v. United States."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,51.913,53.157,Good morning.
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,93.413,99.977,"When you say it's a nullity, what you really mean is it allows for very... very little relief."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,99.977,101.135,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.711,107.727,And why is that an argument in your favor?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,107.727,116.232,"The... it would... the argument is in my favor, Your Honor, because this Court should not read acts of Congress in a manner that would render them absurd."
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.232,124.819,"Well, to say that it doesn't grant as much relief as it might have doesn't render the statute absurd."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,124.819,129.15,"Well, in... in this case, Your Honor, it does in two ways."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.736,162.338,"Well, we've had very few instances in recent years I think where this Court has found some right to be retroactive."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,162.338,163.426,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.426,167.266,So it just doesn't happen very often to begin with.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,167.266,168.412,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.412,174.903,And it would be further limited if the Government's position is adopted here.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,174.903,175.703,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.818,178.349,But it doesn't happen anyway--
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,178.349,179.825,--It... it does not--
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.825,180.055,--very often.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,180.055,183.302,"--It does not happen very often, Your Honor, but there have been several instances."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.026,214.692,How... how do we read this statute concerning what court may find the retroactivity?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,224.384,225.156,"--That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.699,234.861,And it could be a court in another circuit presumably if you're in the Federal system.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,234.861,242.332,"--Well, Your Honor, I would argue that it would have to be a court in the... in the circuit in which the prisoner would be filing the 2255 motion because that--"
2004.04-5286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.332,242.476,Why?
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.476,243.004,Why?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,243.004,250.112,--Because that court would have jurisdiction over the proceedings in his case and it would be an adequate way of providing notice to that litigant.
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.326,257.211,"Well, I guess a litigant can read decisions from other courts, as a lawyer can."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,257.211,260.95,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but they would have no precedential effect in his case."
2004.04-5286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.95,264.619,Why... why shouldn't the litigant be put on notice by a district court decision?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,266.662,275.547,"Well, Your Honor, a district court decision would have no precedential value with respect to... would not bind other district courts in that district and therefore not bind other litigants."
2004.04-5286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.547,276.586,Well--
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.586,282.975,But there's... there's just nothing in the statute that says what level court it has to be.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,282.975,291.161,"Well, actually, Your Honor, the statute does say that the ruling would have to be made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.027,302.888,"Well, but that may be just a generic use of the term cases."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,302.888,307.171,"Well, it could be, Your Honor, but I... Congress included the language."
2004.04-5286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.746,321.709,"Of course, if... if you said a district court, one district judge could... could trigger the thing for the whole country."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,322.184,327.884,"It would be very complicated, Your Honor, given the fact that district courts often issue rulings in unpublished decisions as well."
2004.04-5286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.884,328.397,--Yes.
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,328.397,332.973,So look at the trouble we get into when we take your interpretation.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,365.99,371.477,"If there were only first habeas, Your Honor, and if the lower courts always made the correct retroactivity--"
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.477,371.732,No.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,383.303,384.003,--That's--
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.003,384.866,So... so that's a problem.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,385.911,390.951,"--Well, Your Honor, there is also a problem which the Government actually concedes--"
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.951,391.308,What?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,391.308,408.545,"--which is if you read the statutory language, the second clause as being stated in the past tense, and the initial... and the statute of limitations that begins to run with initial recognition, it... it doesn't respect Congress' intent to provide a 1-year limitation period."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.545,409.995,"Well, but that's... that's linguistic."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,423.622,424.635,With respect to first habeases.
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,424.635,424.768,All right.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,462.773,464.58,"Well, Your Honor--"
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.58,466.298,--given... given paragraph 8.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,466.298,485.188,"--The... the same would be true though, Your Honor, then for initial motions that there would be no right available unless a court at some point had held the right applied retroactively to collateral cases because under Teague v. Lane, there is no right to collateral relief simply based on the decision of this Court unless that decision has also been held retroactively applicable."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.188,491.219,"Well, it's all... the word right in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six words of the... of the sentence."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,496.461,496.579,"Yes, I understand that."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,496.579,498.22,--how do we get to that conclusion.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,511.485,534.989,"Well, Your Honor, I agree with... that... that this is not the best drafted statute that Congress has ever come up with, but I think that respecting Congress' use of verb tense and this Court's decision in Tyler v. Cain, to read paragraph 8(2) and paragraph 6(3) together, that... that it's important that all three of the prerequisites in the statute have been met before the limitation period begins to run."
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.476,542.182,"Why... why is that important, given what this petitioner did himself?"
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,556.09,557.177,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.177,572.841,"So perfectly... the... the prisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after the first cause is satisfied, the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,592.521,593.667,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.585,605.522,"So on your view of it, his complaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed as not ripe because he didn't have the final element--"
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,605.522,605.955,--That's--
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.955,607.357,"--that is, the retroactivity?"
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,607.357,608.077,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,626.583,670.7,"--Of course, if we're... if... if admittedly, as Justice Breyer said, we're trying to figure out some way to make this work in circumstances in which it's... it's never going to work smoothly, I suppose one answer would be to take the Government's position and say you've... your... your year runs from the moment the right is recognized, but to the... to the extent that there is a retroactivity question, a... a court should simply stay the proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether, particularly in... in second habeas where you have the... the second petition where you have the problem, to see whether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity or whether the... your circuit will recognize retroactivity."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,674.36,681.101,"Well, the problem with that, Your Honor, is that it... it encourages, as the Government's rule in general does... encourages numerous frivolous filings."
2004.04-5286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.101,684.902,"Oh, there's no question there's a Rube Goldberg character of the whole thing, I... I realize."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,696.699,706.021,"Well, a procedure that the Seventh Circuit has adopted... and the Seventh Circuit agrees with... with Mr. Dodd's interpretation of the statute that it begins to run with the retroactivity decision."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.885,728.943,It would... it would potentially violate the 1-year limit.
2004.04-5286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.252,731.988,Crazy.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,731.988,732.505,--Well--
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.505,735.428,"I mean, it's a very odd statute."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,735.428,736.404,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.98,739.215,"You... you don't know who's responsible for writing this, do you?"
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,741.503,746.046,Actually my understanding is that much of it was written by the Attorney General in California at the time.
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.046,760.382,Can... do you understand the... the difference between what is a right initially recognized and then what is a right newly recognized?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,766.457,767.518,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.902,793.027,Actually Justice Souter's approach might work here because you... you... all the second habeases file immediately.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,824.205,830.717,"But then, Your Honor, you run up against your decision in Tyler v. Cain, and that was the circumstance of the litigant in Tyler v. Cain."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.586,852.151,"I mean, I'm sure my dissent was correct in that case, but the--"
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,852.561,853.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.1,858.689,The... the... still... it still would work because the first case has come down.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,889.425,891.429,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.621,951.301,But we... we still might be able to deal with it.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,981.738,988.82,"--Well, then, Your Honor, I guess the Court would have to... to totally reconsider its decision in Tyler v. Cain to reach that conclusion."
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.352,1033.544,"The problem with your argument, Ms. Bergmann, seems to be addressed to the idea that Congress intended to sweep quite broadly here."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1069.139,1074.098,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I agree that this involves a very small class of cases."
2004.04-5286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.418,1121.981,"But on your theory, there wouldn't be much in the way of resources because you say there's no ripe claim until the retroactivity decision comes down."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1140.413,1143.068,"--Well, certainly the district courts would do that."
2004.04-5286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.342,1210.037,May I ask this question?
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1231.638,1246.378,"Well, actually, Your Honor, every lower court to consider the language has found that the retroactivity decision need not be made by this Court, and the reason for that is the difference between the language in paragraph 6(3) and in the second or successive provision in paragraph 8(2)."
2004.04-5286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.293,1260.724,"It seems to me that cuts in the other direction, that when Congress thought about the entity that makes it retroactive, they thought about us."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1267.401,1268.735,If... if you apply--
2004.04-5286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.735,1272.564,But I guess nobody has come up with this suggestion other than this question.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1272.564,1285.539,"--Well, various lower courts have considered that possibility and have latched onto the different... differences in language where paragraph 8(2) explicitly states it has to be made by the Supreme Court, but paragraph 6(3) says it does not."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1291.71,1302.068,"Well, if we disagree and think it should be, I guess that would open a door down the road for people after this Court made such a determination."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1302.068,1303.416,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.374,1308.12,Yes.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1308.12,1315.106,"--But again, it would work only if the 1-year period began to run from this Court's retroactivity decision."
2004.04-5286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.082,1339.389,"But that fits the language, the date on which the right was initially recognized by the Supreme Court if and only if it's been made retroactively by the Supreme Court."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1341.688,1346.301,"Yes, Your Honor, that no one lese has... has agreed with thus far."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.301,1347.73,"Yes, but there... it's... I'm now taken with this."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1377.02,1378.757,That's correct.
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.757,1379.782,So it's a first position.
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1425.536,1426.587,"I... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1428.443,1429.52,"Well, don't worry about it."
2004.04-5286,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1431.674,1439.545,"--If the Court has no other questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time."
2004.04-5286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.545,1441.183,"Thank you, Ms. Bergmann."
2004.04-5286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.343,1449.983,"Would you address that last suggestion first, Mr. Feldman?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1449.983,1453.134,I'm not sure I completely held it in... in my mind.
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.134,1455.139,It was very--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1455.139,1455.902,Our basic position is--
2004.04-5286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1455.902,1474.429,"Well, to... to interpret as meaning only this Court could make the retroactivity determination and the 1 year wouldn't run until and unless there was a new rule and subsequently in whatever case this Court said it was retroactive."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1474.429,1475.634,--I... I have two comments about that.
2004.04-5286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1491.299,1496.743,"Well, that's true, but I assume it is, nonetheless, open for us to do so--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1496.743,1496.861,--Yes.
2004.04-5286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1496.861,1498.461,--if we thought it was correct.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1500.456,1514.456,"It would be, but I think we came to the conclusion that it probably wasn't because the words, by the Supreme Court, are not only present in two different places right in this paragraph 6(3), also in 8(2), also in 2244 and in 22... I think... 64."
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.133,1536.252,"It is noticeably missing because it... it has a blank there and the words, by the Supreme Court, are the only time limitation in that whole provision after the word if."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1536.252,1543.756,It... that... it... what it says... it says newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactive.
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1547.26,1554.363,"--But if you don't... aren't... I mean, the language is open, and it's sort of like the virtue of this... suddenly it's like tinkers to Everest chance."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1602.422,1612.379,--I... I think the other... the other problem that I actually am... that I think the Court should be worried about is that this statute sets one... it doesn't say anything about the date on which something is made retroactive.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.456,1664.154,"Yes, it could because you could say what the Congress intended to say."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1668.368,1669.221,--Right.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.221,1670.015,That's implicit in it.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1670.015,1670.821,And it's not--
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1670.821,1672.159,"Just like the words, by the Supreme Court--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1672.159,1672.297,--It's not... it's not--
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.297,1672.883,--would be implicit.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1672.883,1672.989,--it doesn't.
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.74,1698.913,"Well, on Justice Stevens' analysis, he does not have a date until the retroactivity decision is made, and he has to sit there and wait."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1702.401,1707.766,--But this statute doesn't... it's not worded the way the... the... paragraph 6 as a whole says you have the later of four dates.
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1739.439,1743.929,I... I follow your linguistic... Justice Stevens follows the linguistic analysis.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1839.601,1842.886,"--Well, I... I disagree with that."
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1860.762,1861.259,But that is--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1861.259,1863.104,--the Court said we are recognizing a rule of that type.
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1863.104,1884.143,"--That is a highly exceptional case, and the problem with that is... I mean, if... if we're going to... if you're going to be linguistic about it, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound reasoning because that is not a holding because the... you... you've got not merely to have recognized it under the statute, but you've got to have held it."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1888.697,1891.951,"It... it says actually made retroactive, and I... all of--"
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1891.951,1893.016,"Well, I guess we've said you've got to do it with--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1893.016,1914.397,"--all three of the opinions in Tyler recognized that that sort of thing can happen, and I think that that actually is by far the most common kind of case because that's likely to be a case where the Court has said, for example, where Teague doesn't apply at all where the Court has narrowed the scope substantially of a Federal criminal statute such as in the Bailey case where... where the question was whether it has to be active use or mere possession of a firearm."
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.612,1981.755,"In those cases, would the Government ever on its own motion have a defendant retried or released?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1984.604,1989.723,"--I... you know, I... for instance, I don't know what the history was."
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.723,1989.857,I don't think it has.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2008.431,2015.466,I think the... what the Court has said and clarified most recently in the Summerlin case last year is that those... Teague doesn't apply.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.751,2030.65,But what... what interest does the Government have in holding somebody when the conduct for which he was convicted is no longer a crime?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2030.65,2033.013,The Government doesn't have any interest in doing that.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2034.288,2034.986,Why don't you let the guy go?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2034.986,2038.111,--I would... I would recommend the Government do that if we found a case.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2055.774,2057.183,Let's say he's being--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2057.183,2057.688,I can't say how they would work themselves out.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.688,2064.446,--Let's say he's being held because the Government insists that it's not retroactive and the Government is then proven wrong.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2082.003,2083.837,I don't... I don't think... I don't think so because I would only think--
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.837,2084.514,I... I don't think this is going to work.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2084.514,2084.849,--Yes.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.145,2096.581,"Well... well, but it is because he... it hasn't been found retroactive yet and he can't file--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2096.581,2097.317,"--Well, but the... the defendant--"
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2097.317,2097.43,--under your view.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2097.43,2100.005,--The fact that the Government is holding him doesn't prevent him from file.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.688,2108.458,"Well, you prevented him from filing effectively."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2109.579,2110.362,--I don't think--
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.362,2111.237,--the petition has to be dismissed.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2111.237,2112.437,--I don't think the Government has.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.503,2117.781,Yes.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2117.781,2123.263,"And if the Government itself concludes that someone should be released, there are mechanisms to do that--"
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2123.263,2124.159,That's probably right.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2124.159,2124.655,--the Government could.
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2124.655,2128.761,"The language... the language is on your side, I think there's no doubt."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2165.773,2172.023,"I think under that... those circumstances, there may be circumstances under which equitable tolling would be appropriate in a particular case."
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2174.0,2178.667,"You... you'd say, well the language is clear... clear, but let's go... let's go on equitable tolling."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2178.667,2180.196,--But I don't... I wouldn't go here on equitable tolling.
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2184.078,2184.211,"No, no."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2184.498,2205.213,"But where the event that you're relying on for tolling would be an event that is anticipated in the statute and would be across the board and would really have nothing to do with the particular conduct of the petitioner's case, but whether someone else has gone and gotten a retroactivity ruling, I think it would be unprecedented in those circumstances to just rewrite the statute to come to a different date than what Congress had set."
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.053,2212.925,"Mr. Dreeben, could I bring you back to the... the issue?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2272.41,2276.582,"You know, I'd... I'd have to look at the... I can tell you where the statutes are."
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.211,2279.349,Right.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2279.349,2283.803,The other is in 2244 which I think is worded exactly the same as this is.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.213,2299.284,The proximity of the reference to the Supreme Court there really--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2299.284,2299.695,--But--
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.695,2302.084,"--when you read it the first time, you think they're talking about the Supreme Court."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2302.084,2302.751,--You could also--
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.751,2305.492,Has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2305.492,2308.931,"--You could also... you... you could, but you... and we did take that position in Tyler."
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.881,2343.421,Is there anything in any of these statutes or legislative history or any... anyplace else where Congress ever thought of the possibility that some other court might make a new rule retroactive?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2343.421,2348.195,"--I don't think there's any statement one way or another, but I do think there are holdings."
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.16,2358.685,I think the other reading is... the assumption was... and I think it's incorrect... that we would simultaneously identify the new right and decide it is or is not retroactive.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2359.773,2367.277,--I... I just... I think that would be unlikely because this Court's practice has certainly not since Teague and even going decades before Teague--
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.277,2370.338,"No. I realize it's wrong, but I think that's probably the assumption Congress made."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2371.35,2384.075,"--I... I guess I... I would just think it's unlikely because although this statute has some drafting... it certainly raises some drafting issues, I think they likely... that basic element of this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence, which has been true for decades, I think likely--"
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.075,2387.839,"See, the only thing about your reading of the statute that troubles me is you're... you're reading the word only."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2394.905,2397.358,--Just... I'm reading it has an if.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.782,2399.486,There's an only--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2399.486,2401.188,--What if does is states a condition.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.188,2403.63,"--It's not an if, but if that happens, then it shall be--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2403.63,2405.203,"Right, because Congress didn't say it."
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.669,2419.276,"--See, it really--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2419.276,2419.837,--that would have--
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.837,2423.16,--would accomplish your objective if you just struck the whole clause after the word if.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2424.157,2425.212,--I... I don't think so.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2483.492,2486.52,"Well, what courts in... in your view have to make the retroactivity finding?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2491.539,2502.131,I think every court that has addressed that question has come to the conclusion that it can be... it has to be the circuit with territorial jurisdiction over the applicant's case.
2004.04-5286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.806,2526.451,"If it's not that... if it isn't the district court in that case, then you... the district court has to take this complaint and just freeze it until some other... a higher court rules on it."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2526.451,2527.997,--Yes.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2560.402,2566.689,"So that if 10 other circuits have ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can do until somebody within the 1-year window files."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2566.689,2573.786,"Our view... well, that... that... if... if the... the made retroactive has to occur before he files, that would be the consequence."
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.798,2589.312,--So far as first habe goes.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2589.312,2590.879,--So far as first habeas goes.
2004.04-5286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.879,2592.81,"Second habe, he's out cold."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2592.81,2601.417,"I... I think that it's... I don't... second habeas is definitely a narrower window, and I think Congress intended it to be a narrower window."
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.896,2671.869,What it would do... let's take a case which I guess we... Apprendi.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2703.382,2713.131,--I think this Court has... has to take cases and plan its docket in accordance with a wide variety of considerations and that may be something that the Court would want to take into consideration.
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.131,2719.541,"Well, what do you think about the... it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each of which try to get us out of this problem of the pressure, call it."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2747.498,2748.016,I... I--
2004.04-5286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.016,2749.408,But is there any other objection?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2749.408,2758.991,"--I think essentially the same one, that... that they use the term right in 6 and they didn't intend that term to mean something different, whether it was a first habeas or a second habeas."
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.991,2760.287,May I ask you--
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2760.287,2761.044,They were talking about the right that was asserted.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.044,2762.179,--May I ask you this question?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2765.767,2766.439,That's right.
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.058,2769.927,Whereas this just refers to a right and it includes statutory rights.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2779.922,2780.215,--But--
2004.04-5286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.215,2784.344,So the difference between the Constitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2784.344,2785.325,--Yes.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.2,2829.205,"Mr. Feldman, is there any case in which the Supreme Court newly recognizes a right in which it does not initially recognize the right?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2829.205,2833.961,I think there's sound... those seem to me to be synonymous and--
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.961,2848.723,"Well, they're... they're... I thought your position was newly recognized means that it... it has to be the kind of a right that would... would overcome our usual bar to... to, you know, rights that existed before."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2848.723,2849.427,--That's correct.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.614,2860.344,"Every... every newly recognized is an... is an initially recognized, although every initially recognized is not necessarily a newly recognized."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2860.791,2862.882,I was actually thinking of it the other way around.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.882,2863.447,The other way around?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2863.969,2866.06,Which... but that... that... where this Court has--
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.06,2867.618,"You don't know who wrote this either, do you?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2867.739,2868.79,"--No, I don't."
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.007,2887.3,Sure.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2887.3,2891.128,--then the time runs from the date on which it was initially recognized.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.63,2893.149,Which would have been the date on which it was newly recognized.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2893.149,2893.433,--Right.
2004.04-5286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.433,2902.222,"So why couldn't they say, the date on which the right asserted was newly recognized by the Supreme Court if it has been made retroactively applicable?"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2902.985,2903.993,That... that would have been better.
2004.04-5286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2905.929,2922.984,But what about... I think the principal argument that Ms. Bergmann made was your reading means people... you're encouraging filings that inevitably will be thrown out because the right will be made retroactive?
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2922.984,2925.758,I think I just have a couple of answers to that.
2004.04-5286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2938.397,2944.737,But the other... the other way avoids loading the district court with filings that are futile.
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2944.737,2949.564,--But... and which... many of which may be quite easy to... to dismiss.
2004.04-5286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.383,2984.519,"You see, you're... you're saying--"
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2984.519,2984.945,What Congress wanted--
2004.04-5286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.945,2990.139,"--that the district court should take these filings, should not hold them."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2994.086,2997.749,--It can do that subject to appeal and ultimately certiorari in this Court.
2004.04-5286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3075.289,3083.924,"Your... your position is strengthened by the other three provisions of the statute that mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, I take it."
2004.04-5286,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3087.715,3092.375,I think that the date... there's only one possible date that can be found in this language.
2004.04-5286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.226,3136.349,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3139.351,3141.548,Just several quick points.
2004.04-5286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.323,3272.511,"Well, it didn't newly... it didn't newly recognize it either, did it?"
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3272.511,3278.33,"--Well, it... it... I would say that it... it recognized that it was new and that seems to be the way the courts have interpreted--"
2004.04-5286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.33,3284.202,"It was... it recognized that when it would be initially recognized, it would be newly initially recognized."
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3286.073,3296.297,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but I would say that there would be no additional decision of this Court that would be necessary for... for someone to conclude that all three provisions of paragraph 6(3) had been met."
2004.04-5286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.297,3296.793,I see your point.
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.793,3312.478,"I thought it could be, if you want to play games, there is an imaginary right to which Blackstone has referred 48 times."
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3346.935,3347.356,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.209,3360.833,I take it that what I've just said is of total irrelevance to everything.
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3362.209,3363.569,--No.
2004.04-5286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3399.131,3400.822,Not your fault.
2004.04-5286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3400.822,3402.864,"I'm laughing at the statute, not at you."
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3402.864,3403.953,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3488.08,3490.25,How... how is... how does that work?
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3493.258,3493.616,--Well--
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3493.616,3496.676,Suppose he did... he hasn't violated the statute of limitations.
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3503.748,3506.542,"--Well, that would be my argument, Your Honor, that he was premature."
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3506.542,3508.013,But what is premature?
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3514.85,3522.593,That's... that's if the Court would allow the retroactivity decision to be made in the... on an initial motion by the district court in that particular case.
2004.04-5286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3526.918,3527.824,No.
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3532.709,3536.809,"Well, the problem is that some lower courts have held that if you... you file a motion that's untimely--"
2004.04-5286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3536.809,3537.976,"Thank you, Ms. Bergmann."
2004.04-5286,2,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3537.976,3538.585,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.04-5286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3538.585,3539.651,The case is submitted.
