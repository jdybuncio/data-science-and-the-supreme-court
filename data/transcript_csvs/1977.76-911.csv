1977.76-911,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.729,"We will hear arguments next in 76-911, Adamo Wrecking Company against the United States."
1977.76-911,0,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,60.321,65.733,"Thank you, Mr. Chief justice may it please the Court."
1977.76-911,1,43703,weitzenfeld,,842.107,845.903,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-911,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.419,861.812,Your is motion is granted and Mr. Dow and Mr. Mitchell will be admitted.
1977.76-911,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,891.882,894.751,You may proceed Mr. Lipnick.
1977.76-911,2,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,894.751,898.709,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-911,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1050.838,1056.69,"Does that appear in any thing you have filed here, what you have just read?"
1977.76-911,2,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,1056.69,1060.642,I am certain that the final publication is cited in the brief.
1977.76-911,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1063.545,1065.458,"The quotation is not there, but the citation is --"
1977.76-911,2,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,1065.458,1074.386,I am certain that the federal register publication -- this is the final regulation as published.
1977.76-911,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1138.703,1141.933,Very well.
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1152.796,1156.167,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.632,1226.202,"Just so I have got a clear, in -- is there any restriction on what, what issues could be raised in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1226.202,1227.393,There is none Your Honor.
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.084,1231.798,Whether you have gone with -- to the administrator with them or not?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1231.798,1238.543,"Well, the district District of Columbia Circuit requires that the claims have been raised, statutory --"
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.543,1246.077,"So that if you have not presented a particular claim to the agencies, the Court would not hear it?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1246.077,1252.522,"There are sometimes problems of exhaustion of administrative remedies, Your Honor, that would go with claims of this sort."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.929,1278.978,"What would you think about -- what would you think about a coverage question -- well I will just say that the regulation just simply is not authorized by the Statute, that must have been presented to the administrator before the Court will hear it?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1278.978,1284.96,"No Your Honor, I think the pure coverage case could be raised at any time in the DC, not at any time, but it could be raised in the DC Circuit."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.96,1287.575,And without ever having been presented to the administrator?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1287.575,1288.152,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.152,1292.182,What about a constitutional challenge to the underlying Statute?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1292.182,1298.197,"No, the result of that would be the same since the administrator lacks the authority to declare the underlying statute on the Constitution."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.197,1303.686,And what about the constitutionality of a regulation?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1303.686,1307.197,I think that would depend in part on the nature of the challenge to the regulation.
1977.76-911,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.486,1348.724,"How do you work that all in a 30 day time limit, all the administrative exhaustion?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1348.724,1355.416,"The 30 day time limit commences to run Mr. Justice Rehnquist, only after the final promulgation of the regulation."
1977.76-911,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1372.158,1389.668,"Okay, well supposing that person in question gets a copy of the notice or advice, but does not do anything then, and the regulation becomes final and then he seeks to challenge it in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 30 days, is he debarred because he did not challenge it before the agency?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1389.668,1406.961,"If he not only did not challenge it before the agency, but no one challenged it before the agency on those grounds, then consistent with the rationale that I gave an answer to Mr. Justice White's question, I think he would then be barred in the DC Circuit."
1977.76-911,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.873,1436.128,Mr. Easterbrook may I stop you there?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1446.107,1447.434,"I am sorry Your Honor, I do not understand the question."
1977.76-911,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.434,1464.648,"Well, the plain language of the statute controls, (b) (2) says that you are barred unless you file the petition for review as authorized by (b) (1), (b)(1) authorizes a petition for review of the -- the action that administrator in promulgating any admission standard."
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1470.692,1476.032,I believe not Your Honor and I can answer that in several respects.
1977.76-911,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.577,1483.047,Correct.
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1483.047,1495.588,"So for in order, in order for petitioner to prevail here, you would have to first conclude that his contentions are ones that that district of Columbia's Circuit could not have considered on a petition being filed under (b) (1)."
1977.76-911,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.588,1496.499,Correct.
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1496.499,1515.618,"The District Of Columbia Circuit has held in the Ohato Case which is cited in the footnote at page 15 of our brief that it may consider challenges similar to the challenge that issues here, that is a contention that the regulation was on its face is not the kind of thing the Statute authorized."
1977.76-911,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.377,1572.682,"Yes, but under your view, if the administrator promulgates something called an emission standard and the text of it is that every wrecker shall pay $500 a month into a conservation fund, he is bound to go to the Court of Appeals, no matter how far away from the legislative intent that was?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1572.682,1579.108,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do not think that we need to make an argument that extreme in order to prevail here."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.684,1669.624,"But even if the District Court asked those questions and answers them no, this is not kind of a -- he does not even purport to be acting under the Section, that question still could have been raised in the Court of Appeals under your argument?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1669.624,1680.804,"When I answered Mr. Rehnquist by saying that we did not have to go as far as his hypothetical, I did not mean to say that we think it would be inappropriate for the District of Columbia Circuit to review it."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.164,1688.997,There are some questions that can be raised later despite Section 112?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1688.997,1703.076,"I think, no the question -- the suggestion that I made to Mr. Justice Rehnquist was I think the same kind of question that the District of Columbia Circuit would ask itself when someone filed a petition for review in the District of Columbia Circuit."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.613,1714.998,If it is wrong enough we will not review it?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1714.998,1715.555,Pardon?
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.555,1718.117,If it is wrong enough we will not review it?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1718.117,1723.949,"Not if it is wrong enough, but if it is not -- not even purported to be promulgated under this Section."
1977.76-911,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.949,1726.786,So we just had it stand in District of Columbia Circuit?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1726.786,1732.671,The District of Columbia Circuit's answer I think would be that this could something for an original action in the District Court.
1977.76-911,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.096,2070.926,But did Leedom not involve a certification of a bargaining unit?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2070.926,2072.083,Of a bargaining unit.
1977.76-911,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.083,2076.165,And is not review always available on an ADA-5 violation for refusal of the bargain?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2076.165,2079.937,It would be available only if the employer then refuse to bargain.
1977.76-911,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.937,2084.905,"Right and that is the normal way in which it is reviewable, it is reviewable thousands of times a year by the Board, is not it?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2084.905,2098.299,"Yes it is, but in Leedom the question was inclusion of particular employees in the bargaining unit and the employer and the employee, the employer and the union were then going to bargain, there never would have been any ADA-5 violation in Leedom."
1977.76-911,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2101.716,2105.243,Refuses to bargain and he can refuse to bargain because he says this is not the appropriate bargaining?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2105.243,2107.73,"That is right, but that was not happen in Leedom?"
1977.76-911,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.73,2113.136,It did not happen because Leedom said that an appeal was allowable before it happened?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2113.136,2126.772,"But the, my point Mr. Justice Stewart was that there was going to be no review in Leedom because the employer had already said that he was willing to bargain so it was case in which there could be no effective review at all."
1977.76-911,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.915,2171.029,"Well, if there is any practically, you mentioned the word practical a couple sentences ago and if you take a record out in 2000 miles away from Washington, that does not read the Federal register and so far has a very small business."
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2176.935,2179.919,I do not think that is so Your Honor.
1977.76-911,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.714,2260.374,"Well, you know I may agree with that and perhaps all the court may agree with that, but I think you should delete the word practical then from your argument because as a practical matter many, many small businessmen would be precluded from reviewing this sort of thing?"
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2260.374,2267.044,I did not want to imply that all of them would read the Federal register and I retract that kind of suggestion.
1977.76-911,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.529,2385.284,"But Mr. Easterbrook, there is a rather clear difference between what the Statute says in the category you describe arbitrary and capricious and the like."
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2404.258,2409.885,"In part, in part I think we may have became engaged in the semantic exercise."
1977.76-911,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.461,2474.663,Would any of your arguments be any different Mr. Easterbrook if the time period was ten days?
1977.76-911,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2474.663,2484.587,Those kinds of arguments would go Mr Chief Justice to whether the procedures for review established an adequate forum in which it could be reviewed.
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3006.676,3009.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-911,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.561,3144.164,"Can I ask you in the criminal enforcement proceeding, is there some -- what is the state of knowledge by the defendant supposed to be for liability?"
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3144.164,3146.176,You mean as a matter of law?
1977.76-911,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.371,3179.4,"But, it is not required that you know anything about the law?"
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3179.4,3185.621,I believe that this Court's decision in Boyce Motor Lines in its progeny make it very clear that our knowledge of the law is absolutely irrelevant.
1977.76-911,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.621,3189.298,"I just wondered if, under this statute it imposes any difference standard?"
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3189.298,3191.736,Not that I am aware of.
1977.76-911,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.147,3263.838,"What if Congress had passed a law that simply said anything labeled an emission standard by the administrator and not challenged within 30 days of its promulgation, shall be deemed written into the statute itself."
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3265.98,3297.344,"I think -- well the closest case I would have would be Thermotron from last year in which if I recall correctly the statute said, decision remanding to a State Court was absolutely unreviewable and this Court said that it was at least reviewable to ascertain that the trial judge had remanded on a ground specified as a basis for remand in the statute."
1977.76-911,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.656,3381.849,"Mr. Lipnick, if we should be persuaded that the jurisdictional issue depends on whether or not it is an emission standard, and you have to decide the merits to decide whether 307 (b) (2) applied."
1977.76-911,4,41650,stanley_m_lipnick,,3388.798,3412.492,"In our view, I think the record is perfectly adequate to enable this Court to decide it, particularly with the 1977 amendments which I think make abundantly clear that a work practice rule just as not the same thing as an emission standard and with the government just today said that in the government's view, the 1977 amendments do not change the law."
1977.76-911,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3460.335,3461.057,Thank you gentlemen.
