1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.021,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94 923, Ruth Shaw v. James B. Hunt; Number 94 924, James Pope v. James B. Hunt."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,37.606,42.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.416,71.427,"The Court's opinion, Mr. Everett."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,71.427,72.569,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,72.569,74.979,"The Court's opinion, not my opinion."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,74.979,77.0,"The Court's opinion, one which you authored."
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,159.135,163.217,Does it say that the people in those districts can drink at either water fountain?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,166.18,175.586,"They can vote as they please, Justice Stevens, but on the other hand they are preconditioned in their behavior by the fact that these districts carry a message."
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.186,178.318,The same message your signs carry.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,178.318,179.249,--Your Honor?
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,179.249,182.711,"The same message that your signs carry, I guess, but they actually didn't inhibit."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,182.711,183.089,Exactly.
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,183.089,184.831,You pick the fountain you wanted to pick.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,184.831,191.056,"We are saying that these, though, carry a message, and the signs would be impermissible."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.592,202.544,I don't know who you'd get it from.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,202.804,215.303,"--I would hope at least we could get a majority, but in any event, it would seem to me what we are saying is these signs, these labels should be removed."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.729,296.134,"Mr. Everett, there is some difference, isn't there, with respect to the standing of the plaintiffs in this case with respect to one district and the other?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,296.134,302.438,"We would maintain, Your Honor, that due to the ripple effect all these plaintiffs have standing as to all the districts."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.438,308.052,"Well, but supposing we don't accept the ripple effect, there is some difference, isn't there?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,308.052,312.336,"Oh, Professor Shimm and Mrs. Shaw are in the 12th District."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.481,336.002,Suppose--
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,344.887,355.953,"--I don't believe they made it, as I recall... I was here at the argument... and I don't think it was articulated in that particular fashion, but our position would be this, Your Honor, as a practical matter."
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.277,384.492,You're saying that a person who has a right to challenge one district by reason of residence in that district has a right to challenge the entire plan.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,384.492,386.195,"--I would say, Your Honor--"
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.195,387.573,That's a different argument from the ripple effect.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,387.573,393.417,"--It's... I would say that in this particular situation, given the inner penetration of the plan, that would be true."
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.048,403.585,Including the aspects of the plan that you claim are invalid with respect to other districts.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,403.585,428.219,"--We would think across the board in this situation, and we would note this, Your Honor, that the... well, I will admit, Cherokee County, over here, up into Tennessee, I'm not really saying that I'd have much standing perhaps to challenge that, but as a practical matter, everything in the middle and the eastern part of North Carolina is so tied together as a practical matter it is one plan."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.151,690.831,"Mr. Everett, may I ask you this question?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,724.164,727.075,"Your Honor, I used to teach evidence a couple of times."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.6,734.612,I'm asking you whether they're inconsistent.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,734.612,735.1,"--Well, I'd say--"
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.1,739.454,"One says the motive... the motive the first time was to obtain section 5 preclearance, period."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,740.916,742.516,"--That's the only question, they say."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,742.516,751.883,And the finding now is that that configuration was necessary and hence justifiable to avoid a section 2 violation.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,754.513,756.254,"They are in this context, Justice Souter."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.72,765.931,"Well, that may be, but that wasn't my question."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,788.956,790.548,"--Your Honor, let me--"
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,790.548,790.869,--can be upheld.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,792.759,795.891,--Let me say in this context they are very inconsistent.
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.891,796.292,"No, they're not."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,803.855,804.657,Well--
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.657,805.648,So they're not inconsistent.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,805.648,806.307,--If--
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.307,820.946,"If they can prove that it was indeed necessary, that there's no other thing you could have done... I think that's a hard thing to prove, but... that no other configuration could possibly have been adopted which would comply with section 2, I suppose if they can prove that, it's certainly not inconsistent--"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,820.946,822.578,--Justice Scalia--
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.578,824.089,--with the fact that they intended to do section 5.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,824.089,830.253,"--Justice Scalia, if they didn't intend to do it, they didn't intend to do it, they can't justify it."
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.796,832.944,"That's a different argument, though."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,850.365,852.498,"--That is part of our position, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.448,855.03,"Well, let me must pursue that for a moment."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,873.372,895.305,"--Your Honor, if it is a matter of justifying something under strict scrutiny something that is a racial gerrymander, and if the legislature that adopted the racial gerrymander didn't even think about it, then we would maintain that in order to have the integrity of equal protection and to protect the constitutional rights of us voters, yes, that should be disregarded."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.305,895.535,Okay.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,928.147,932.54,"Your Honor, I would not say they are estopped from considering it, or anything of that sort."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,937.283,939.122,"No, but I want you to answer my hypo."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,939.122,939.463,--Fine.
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,939.463,942.465,And I'm not suggesting to you that my hypo is this case--
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,942.465,942.786,Sure.
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.786,954.513,"--and I'm not asking you to concede that, but on my hypo, may the three judge district court consider the defense, if you want to put it that way, that this is reasonably necessary to avoid a section 2 violation?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,954.513,956.994,Two aspects to that.
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,963.99,967.913,"That goes to the, sort of to the facts of the particular case."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,975.838,978.931,"--Your Honor, we're going to take an outlandish position."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.415,996.153,"Maybe it isn't, but maybe... and that then may lead you to claim that section 2 is unconstitutional, or whatever, but is it relevant as a defense?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,997.111,1009.791,"--We would maintain that, given the purposes of section 2 as we understand it, that it would not be permissible to use it as a vehicle for imposing two majority minority districts in a--"
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1009.791,1011.053,That wasn't my question.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1014.713,1015.755,"--We would say no, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1015.755,1027.943,"So are you saying, then, that a... that the object to avoid a section 2 violation as a matter of law may not be considered as a justification under strict scrutiny?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1027.943,1043.143,"We do not believe, Your Honor, that it constitutes a compelling interest, given the purposes of section 2 and its process orientation, and by the way, there's an excellent discussion of that by Professor Blumstein in his recent Rutgers Law Review paper."
1995.94-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.143,1046.844,Is the reason for your answer essentially that section 2 is unconstitutional?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1046.844,1060.835,"Our position would be that section 2 as properly construed and narrowed is probably constitutional, but that certainly to use it as a vehicle for compelling majority minority districts is unconstitutional."
1995.94-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1060.835,1063.769,How about a voluntary majority minority district?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1086.834,1088.233,"Your Honor, we say this."
1995.94-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.993,1126.788,"Am I right that there are many congressional districts, many State districts across the country where people said exactly that, we want a majority minority district, so on your reasoning, a good deal of the redistricting was unconstitutional."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1126.788,1143.949,--On our reasoning a good deal of the redistricting that followed the 1990 census was unconstitutional because it is result oriented in a manner of labeling just like labeling the water fountains in my example.
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1143.949,1167.405,"Well, that... would you take that position even in circumstances in which to accomplish the goal, the legislature did not resort to drawing the lines on the basis of race, but rather on the basis of voter registration?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1167.405,1171.969,"If it's a matter of, say, Democrat Republican, that's certainly... if it--"
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.969,1189.921,"Their goal was admittedly to get a majority minority district, but to achieve it they put in the computer program data about voter registration, Democrat, Republican, Independent, and they drew the districts on that basis."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1189.921,1195.835,"--If the goal is defined by race, then our position is it's impermissible, as, for example, in the case--"
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.835,1204.039,You say that cannot be done even if the boundaries are drawn on the basis of voter registration?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1204.039,1207.442,"--If it's voter... I'm not sure I understand exactly, Your Honor, but if--"
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1207.442,1222.983,"You get a computer program to draw the boundaries, and you plug into the computer how the voters are registered, Democrat, Republican, independent, Dixiecrat, whatever it might be, and the lines are drawn on that basis."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1222.983,1224.895,"--There's no race there, as I understand it."
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1224.895,1234.112,"The goal was to create a majority minority district, but it is accomplished by using nonracial data."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1234.112,1236.794,"Your Honor, we think the goal is impermissible."
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.439,1358.584,"So then you would say the same principle applies to every, whether it's a city council, whether it's any of the hundreds of thousands of elections that if people draw boundaries to a significant extent on the basis of race, I take it, of religion, of ethnic background, of sex, of anything of that nature, that that then will come into Federal court and they will then look and see if significant boundaries in this local city council race, or whatever, a significant number of those boundaries was drawn with religion in mind or ethnicity."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1360.476,1363.649,"Your Honor, that may sound extreme."
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.598,1365.9,"No, no, that maybe preferable to--"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1365.9,1366.13,--Well--
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.13,1373.166,--saying that you can't do this in the case of a black effort but you can do it in the case of any other effort.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1375.638,1375.988,"--Well, we--"
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.988,1379.918,"--I agree with you on that failure and difficulty of distinguishing, if that is your position."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1379.918,1383.201,"--Well, Justice Breyer, we do view race as having a special significance."
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1383.201,1399.163,"You mean, you could in fact say they cannot gerrymander or draw boundaries on the basis of race, but you can draw... if the person is... to benefit African Americans, but you can do exactly the same thing for the purpose of benefiting the Jews or the Catholics or any other group in society?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1399.163,1399.951,No.
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.019,1414.152,"Well, I mean, are you distinguishing whether it's a whole district, or part of a district, or what is... I'm trying... what are you distinguishing?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1414.152,1428.141,"--Our distinction is in terms of purpose, very much like the Batson situation, where, if there is a purpose to do it on a racial basis or an ethnic basis or a religious basis or a gender basis, then that is impermissible."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1446.233,1451.025,Classification on the basis of gender has not been subject to strict scrutiny in the past.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1454.428,1463.062,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I leaped over in my enthusiasm into another area of gender, and that is certainly a different--"
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.062,1477.021,"May I ask you, Mr. Everett, supposing you have a case in which it's perfectly clear that the legislature decided to create two majority minority districts, is there any way in the world in which the plan could survive strict scrutiny?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1479.204,1485.269,"--Well, Your Honor, we would think that there would have to be so many circumstances totally different from those in North Carolina--"
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.269,1493.103,"No, but just hypothetically, what are the kind of factors that would enable... is there any set of facts... your argument is pretty firm, it seems to me--"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1493.103,1493.383,--Well--
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.383,1497.327,"--that if we know they wanted two minority majority districts, that's the end of the ball game."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1497.327,1503.289,"--Well, one thing that would be very important is the sort of consideration that was outlined of totality of circumstances in Johnson--"
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.289,1508.723,"Mr. Everett, I haven't understood everything you've been saying... if your answer to that isn't a clear yes, I don't know what you've been saying."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1508.723,1509.024,--I--
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.024,1511.247,I thought you've been saying the motivation cannot be racial.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1511.247,1512.047,--That's it.
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.047,1514.881,And if I set out to create two majority minority districts--
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1514.881,1516.159,That's exactly--
1995.94-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.159,1517.121,"--that's the end of it, right?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1517.121,1518.01,--I think--
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.01,1525.126,"There is no way to get by the strict scrutiny hurdle if that original intent is established, and I don't think there's much doubt about it in this case."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1538.724,1538.974,--Yes.
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.655,1540.907,Yes.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1540.907,1542.486,--race is impermissible.
1995.94-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.91,1550.193,And really the shape merely confirms the other evidence of intent.
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1550.193,1550.783,--The evidence--
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.783,1562.642,"So you take the position that if strict scrutiny is applied, it's fatal in fact, necessarily, that nothing survives strict scrutiny."
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1562.642,1571.257,"--As to majority minority districts in almost anything, any situation we can conceive of, if they are created for a racial purpose per se, we believe they cannot survive."
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.257,1571.657,I had--
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1587.729,1597.925,"Well, Your Honor, I suppose I'm descending from the theoretical to the practical in that we have been unable to conceive of anything, at least in our limited experience, which--"
1995.94-923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.925,1602.91,"Compliance with section 2 could not be a compelling State interest, or it could?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1602.91,1608.443,"--We would consider that it could not be, for the creation of majority minority districts."
1995.94-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.443,1610.574,Do you have to take that position to prevail in this case?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1610.574,1610.945,Absolutely not.
1995.94-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.945,1614.257,What is you secondary position with respect to this case?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1614.257,1637.151,"Our secondary position is that it is clear there was not a reevaluation of section 2, that the section 5 denial of preclearance tainted everything, that just as the State represented when it came up here the first time, it was a matter of fulfilling the mandate of the Justice Department just as it was in Miller, and therefore this should fall, just as the Georgia redistricting fell."
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1679.67,1686.465,"I have a map here that says plan NEC Shaw II type TGB, Shaw II, map 2--"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1686.465,1687.166,"Oh, Your Honor--"
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.166,1688.075,--Isn't that the compact one?
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1689.026,1690.018,--I know what you're talking about.
1995.94-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.018,1692.059,"Why wasn't that the compact, with two?"
1995.94-923,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1692.059,1695.412,"Well, Your Honor, majority black is 50 percent."
1995.94-923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.007,1734.327,"Thank you, Mr. Everett."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1767.199,1778.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.474,1811.057,"If it can be a compelling State interest in some cases, why isn't it in this?"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1811.057,1816.541,"It is not a compelling State interest in this case, Your Honor, for two reasons."
1995.94-923,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.761,1863.351,May I go back to your first reason?
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1874.3,1884.695,"--Your Honor, I think that there's evidence in this case from which it might be concluded that a majority black district could be created in northeastern North Carolina--"
1995.94-923,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.695,1884.935,Right.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1884.935,1889.22,--and that a majority minority district could be created running from Charlotte to the southeastern part of the State.
1995.94-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.049,1934.417,"Well, would you--"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1965.879,1966.32,Your Honor--
1995.94-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.32,1969.382,It's sort of a racial entitlement theory.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,1974.385,1987.404,"--Your Honor, we think that this right under the Voting Rights Act is not a right that is enjoyed by any minority in the State of North Carolina."
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.942,2082.474,"The reason, I take it, is that the specific argument would be that section 2 requires the creation of two districts in North Carolina because, just as you pointed out, one could be done in that part of the State and the other in the other part of the State, and the only reason that they're in a different place is for incumbency protection reasons, and that latter reason has nothing to do with race, and if you say that you can't do that, then you're saying that you can't do it when black districts are involved but you could do it when white districts are involved, and so the latter proposition is an impossible one to maintain."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2082.474,2083.175,"Your Honor, we--"
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.175,2083.614,Legally.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2083.614,2084.306,--We would--
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.306,2087.478,"And so I mean, that's the specific argument, so I'd appreciate your addressing that."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2087.478,2090.19,"--Well, we respectfully disagree with Your Honor's position on that."
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.19,2091.713,I'm not taking that as a position.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2094.864,2106.913,"Your Honor, we don't think that there's evidence, nor was there ever any intention to say that the State legislature should look at the State of North Carolina and conclude that minorities are entitled to proportional representation in the State of North Carolina."
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.791,2111.985,"So the first possibility is, it isn't true that they'd be in violation of the Voting Rights Act."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2122.231,2122.501,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.501,2123.062,--And what's that?
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2123.062,2135.421,"We believe, Your Honor, that that would fail the narrow tailoring requirement of strict scrutiny, and specifically, Your Honor, it's these people in this part of North Carolina that had their votes diluted."
1995.94-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.103,2145.058,But I thought the point would be that they would not be drawing it solely on the basis of incumbency protection.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2151.981,2153.142,"That's very true, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.142,2165.601,"But it would still be racial boundary drawing, and your position is that's okay when you're doing it in order to comply with section 2, but it's not okay when you're doing it to protect incumbents, I suppose."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2165.601,2169.862,"Yes, I don't think incumbency protection is a compelling governmental interest, Your Honor, and in fact--"
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2169.862,2195.619,"Well, it may not be a... and no, I don't think anybody is claiming that it's a compelling governmental interest, but it is a relevant consideration, as I understand it, under Miller, in determining the extent to which race predominates, because one of the things you ask, the principal question you asked, I guess, is, has race subordinated traditional districting principles?"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2234.775,2236.297,"--No, Your Honor, I don't concede that."
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.297,2238.047,Then tell me why not.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2238.047,2255.639,"Well, if I understood your question, you were saying, and Justice Scalia, we believe it's a very difficult case to prove a section 2 violation, and I hope I have a chance to explain that before I sit down, but Justice Souter, we again believe that the remedy must go to the people who have been injured, and if--"
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2255.639,2267.185,"No, but you are saying not that the remedy must go to the people who have been injured, but that the remedy must go to all and only the people injured, and no other consideration may play a role--"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2267.185,2267.765,--I think--
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2267.765,2301.409,"--and if you are saying that, I think, you are asking the Court to depart at least in one respect from Miller, because Miller says a consideration as to whether race has subordinated, whether race is predominant, is, has race subordinated traditional districting principles, and if a traditional districting principle is incumbency protection, you are saying, well, you've got to modify Miller to the extent that incumbency protection will never be cognizable here, so I think you're asking for a change in Miller."
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2301.409,2302.618,"--Well, I don't believe we are, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2302.618,2303.128,"Well, why not?"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2319.711,2320.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.252,2322.112,--because that would modify the boundary--
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2322.112,2322.573,Yes.
1995.94-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.573,2324.253,--then to that extent you're modifying Miller.
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2324.253,2330.789,"Well, Your Honor, first you're assuming that incumbency protection is the type of traditional districting principle that the Court was referring to in the Miller case."
1995.94-923,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.789,2331.63,"Well, is it legitimate or not?"
1995.94-923,1,42660,thomas_a_farr,,2333.008,2348.109,"Your Honor, I think there's a great distinction, because when you're talking about political subdivisions or county lines, you're talking about neutral criteria, and I believe that the Court discussed those issues as a frame of reference to show in a case involving circumstantial evidence whether or not you could prove the intent element of the Miller claim."
1995.94-923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2368.252,2369.224,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2372.456,2377.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.626,2422.187,What color is the 12th District on the map?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2422.187,2424.238,"The 12th district is orange, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.238,2425.159,"Oh, okay."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2425.159,2435.187,"It is located entirely within the 10 counties that make up the Piedmont Urban Crescent, an area that the historians tell us has historic integrity."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.918,2480.205,"That's what a district court is supposed to sit in judgment of, of whether a particular redistricting scheme provides fair and effective representation?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2480.205,2488.031,"It would seem to us, Your Honor, that those are very pertinent issues for... the issues for the Court to consider in regard to the issues in front of you."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.512,2493.995,"I mean, it's a nice thing, who could be against it, but I wouldn't want to have to... this is the kind of thing that judges and lawyers are good at doing?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2493.995,2505.492,"--In this case, the evidence was presented that the district does provide fair and effective representation, and the district court found that it does, in fact, do that, so we think it is important, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.492,2515.878,"Is that a test that every redistricting plan and every State must meet, that the particular district provides fair and effective representation?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2515.878,2535.261,"No, Your Honor, but we think in this case that the issue of whether the district provides fair and effective representation is relevant to the issue of standing, is relevant to the issue of whether race was the predominant motive... if race was the predominant motive, you would assume that the district might not provide fair and effective representation for white citizens, and in fact--"
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.261,2536.042,"Maybe so, maybe not."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2546.709,2547.928,--But it was fair and effective--
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.928,2548.599,--Where do you get this test?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2550.102,2558.186,"--We get it, Your Honor, from your statements that the purpose, the ultimate purpose, the fundamental purpose of redistricting is to provide fair and effective representation."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.186,2568.084,"Well, of course it is, and there are certain subrules that we follow and apply to determine whether that's been done, but we just don't sit in the abstract and decide whether there's fair and effective representation."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2568.084,2569.353,"This wasn't done in the abstract, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2573.107,2578.669,"But I thought it was remanded to apply strict scrutiny, and I'm not sure how that's relevant."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2588.266,2593.279,"Well, certainly we do believe that this particular plan meets strict scrutiny."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.918,2607.198,What was the compelling interest that the district court found?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2610.561,2613.833,"With section 2 and section 5, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2613.833,2614.454,All right.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2624.16,2625.57,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2625.57,2637.528,"Before this district was drawn, would the black voters in western... that western part in Gaston County have had standing to bring a section 2 vote dilution claim?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2637.528,2642.263,"Yes, I believe a black voter would have had standing to bring--"
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.263,2646.184,"Oh, you think that there was... that they were then in a district which was compact--"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2646.184,2646.855,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.855,2648.405,--and contiguous under the Gingles test?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2648.405,2655.8,I believe that a black voter in North Carolina would have had standing--
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.8,2656.902,"No, no, I'm talking about--"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2656.902,2660.712,--to bring a section 2 claim asserting a violation of section 2.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.712,2668.019,"--No, no, based on... based on the voters in Gaston County being unrepresented in a black district."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2676.865,2687.962,"The question under a section 2 case, would there been, have been the potential for the State of North Carolina to created, to have created a geographically compact district to... that would have--"
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2687.962,2690.803,"But they necessarily fail that, don't they?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2690.803,2691.824,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2710.755,2711.225,So--
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2711.225,2714.078,--so long as it provides fair and effective representation.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.078,2717.25,--So then the remedy has nothing to do with the initial violation.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2718.95,2737.182,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that in this case the evidence is, and certainly the district court found, that there was racially polarized voting within this particular area, or these areas where these districts were created, so it is our position that there is a fit between these particular districts and the section 2--"
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2737.182,2740.965,"You must also find, under Gingles at least, that the other factors are present."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2740.965,2741.335,--Yes.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2741.335,2743.397,And you can't just talk about racial polarizing.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2746.378,2752.353,"And certainly there's no question, it's unrefuted in this case, that black citizens vote together cohesively."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.353,2765.432,"Two districts... is there not just unrefuted evidence, is there any evidence that two compact black districts, black majority, not minority majority, but black majority districts could have been created?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2765.432,2770.425,Many different districts were presented to the North Carolina General Assembly.
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.391,2780.011,Could two--
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2780.011,2780.96,--and some were here.
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.96,2782.252,--Could two have been created?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2810.252,2814.353,"I would cite you Shaw I, Shaw I, II, and III, to begin with."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.767,2824.911,"I want two black majority, not majority minority."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2828.722,2847.936,"--I would cite to you the plan prepared and presented by Representative Larry Justus, which was labeled Compact 2, which I believe creates, and was presented in January of 1992 to the General Assembly, which is contained... a map of which is contained in the maps lodged with the court, and I will obtain those."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.265,2866.436,And these plans had two black districts.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2878.284,2885.77,--I don't believe that any individual put before the General Assembly at a time--
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.77,2887.42,But that's the whole point.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2887.42,2888.802,--a plan that had two districts--
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.802,2889.113,Can you create two?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2889.113,2889.573,--Yes.
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2889.573,2900.811,"I know you could create one here, or you could create one somewhere else, but is there any evidence that you could create two simultaneously majority black, which is what your remedy proposes to do."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2900.811,2905.983,"I believe, Your Honor, that the legislators believed that could be done."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.833,2908.664,"Well, they have to be right."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2911.246,2912.528,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.672,2943.159,"Well, two districts can be drawn in the sense of, we can legislate them, or two districts can be drawn under the Gingles test?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2943.159,2947.36,"Two districts that can be drawn, I believe is the thrust of their statements, that some people--"
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.36,2947.621,We know that.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2947.621,2949.11,--would perceive to be--
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.11,2949.711,It's been done.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2972.668,2976.86,"--Of course, Your Honor, to a large extent, compactness is in the eye of the beholder."
1995.94-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.86,2978.663,Can you create two or not?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2986.797,2987.495,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.495,2996.562,"Just... I mean, has anybody sat down and done it, so that you could show that you could create two compact majority minority districts in the State, or majority black districts?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,2996.562,3000.324,There are... there were numerous plans presented to the General Assembly--
1995.94-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.324,3000.505,Compact.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3000.505,3000.905,--Fact.
1995.94-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.905,3001.686,Compact.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3001.686,3005.388,Which included two majority minority districts.
1995.94-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.388,3006.319,That were compact.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3006.319,3017.666,"In several of the plans, one of the districts was compact to the eye, and the others, the district might not have been compact to the eye, but all together--"
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.666,3020.708,"Majority black is what we're talking about, not just majority minority... majority black."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3020.708,3021.239,--I understand... I understand.
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.239,3023.379,The last time you said majority minority.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3024.22,3025.92,I understand the distinction you're making.
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3025.92,3029.273,"Let me ask... oh, I'm sorry, are you still answering Justice Breyer's question?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3029.273,3029.563,No.
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3029.563,3030.014,Okay.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3063.628,3064.088,"Yes, we do."
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3064.088,3066.359,No overlap at all.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3066.359,3068.629,We take that position--
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3068.629,3076.373,"It's not merely the case that you can modify around the edges, move to the right, move to the left a bit here and there, in order to obtain other objectives."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3085.74,3087.042,"--Charlotte, of course, was coincident."
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3087.042,3088.762,That's... that's... your answer is yes.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3088.762,3091.644,Virtually all of these districts in Charlotte and Gastonia are a large part of--
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.644,3094.015,"But your answer is yes to my question, is that--"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3094.015,3103.412,"--My answer is that it is within the State's discretion once it has a basis to believe that a section 2 violation could be established, to determine where to place the district."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3105.224,3105.952,--How does that comport with narrow tailoring?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3113.118,3113.469,Yes.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3113.469,3132.31,"But I thought that narrow tailoring meant that there is a wrong, and that the remedy has to be as closely designed to cure that evil as possible, and what you're telling me now is that once you find that there's a violation, you can adopt any remedy you want--"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3132.31,3133.101,No.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3133.101,3137.816,--and that seems to me quite the polar opposite of narrow tailoring.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3137.816,3138.945,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3181.033,3183.796,What is the harm to innocent third parties?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3183.796,3198.374,"--My understanding of your prior decisions is that the existence of harm, of some harm to innocent third parties as a consequence of the action taken to remedy a discrimination is an important element of narrow tailoring."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.374,3204.018,That would comprehend exclusion of whites from a district because of their race.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3205.79,3212.693,"Well, Your Honor, the evidence in this case establishes that the 12th District provides, and the court found, fair and effective representation for all citizens."
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3212.693,3218.767,"I'm asking what harm, an example of harm to an innocent third party is in the context of redistricting."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3225.933,3226.851,A harm--
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3226.851,3234.988,That has ties to their community and to their former district.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3234.988,3241.043,--A harm to an innocent third party could be denial of accessibility between them and their representatives.
1995.94-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3241.043,3241.761,Yes.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3241.761,3243.033,This district doesn't do that.
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.033,3243.824,"Well now, wait."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3254.429,3255.351,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.351,3260.374,"No harm to fair and effective transportation, or schooling, if they're made to go to a separate school?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3269.67,3271.14,"I don't think that's what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3292.504,3297.369,"Well, now we're back to that same peculiar test, and I don't know what it has to do with narrow tailoring."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3297.369,3307.475,"--It was certainly our understanding, and the district court found, that an element of narrow tailoring is whether there's harm to innocent third parties."
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3307.475,3317.893,Then why shouldn't it also be an element of narrow tailoring whether there is any amelioration to the black voters who were the subject of the Gingles qualifying analysis in the first place?
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3318.922,3320.614,This district--
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3320.614,3333.621,"No, but on your theory, they can be ignored, because you said you can put the district anywhere else in the State, and it need not in any way be coincident with, we'll call it the Gingles qualifying district, which allows you to do this in the first place."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3333.621,3340.245,"--The harm to black citizens, Your Honor, is the dilution of their votes, the racially polarized voting."
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3340.245,3346.02,And those whose votes were diluted and subject to a Gingles remedy on your analysis can be ignored entirely.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3346.02,3349.853,I don't believe that's the consequence of--
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3349.853,3359.249,"Then why don't you take the position that there's at least got to be some coincidence between the ultimate majority minority district and the Gingles district, which allows you to do this in the first place?"
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3359.249,3367.895,"--Your Honor, there... you... I believe there is coincidence between the harms and North--"
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3367.895,3369.044,Then I don't understand your answer.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3380.582,3384.595,--All North Carolina black citizens have been the victims of racially polarized voting.
1995.94-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3387.877,3395.942,"So your position is a kind of racial entitlement theory, as opposed to individual group of voters entitlement theory."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3395.942,3402.838,--It would... the group of voters within the district where the racially polarized voting exists would be--

1995.94-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3415.806,3415.985,Ah.
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3443.904,3450.349,"--The evidence in this case, Your Honor, is that there are significant concentrations of black citizens in this district."
1995.94-923,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3452.809,3464.097,"Mr. Speas, your answers to the questions that is part 2 of your argument seem to be colored by what is your main position, which you haven't had an opportunity to state."
1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3494.387,3497.749,"--Our first position is, the district is not subject to strict scrutiny."
1995.94-923,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3497.749,3498.648,And why not?

1995.94-923,2,23190,edwin_m_speas_jr,,3536.174,3536.725,--Thank you.
1995.94-923,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3536.725,3538.696,"Mr. Chambers, we'll hear from you."

1995.94-923,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3656.382,3672.374,"Mr. Chambers, many people think that black people can have a greater voice when they are close to a majority, or at least a substantial minority in a lot of districts, rather than a majority in one or two districts."
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3711.648,3713.23,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3729.921,3732.813,"What does that mean, you couldn't elect a candidate of choice?"
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3738.235,3745.421,It's because the candidate was not the representative of choice for African Americans in North Carolina.
1995.94-923,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3745.421,3746.352,I don't know what that means.
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3746.352,3751.595,"It means, Your Honor, the same thing it would mean for you if you didn't have a voice in the election of your representative."

1995.94-923,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3857.684,3858.064,Well could--
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3858.064,3858.556,--Yes.
1995.94-923,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3858.556,3860.356,--Just in general could you answer?
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3860.356,3878.598,"Well, in general, I would say that if we're looking at a congressional district, and we're looking at a State, I would submit that it would permit the State, using its discretion, which is the second point I wanted to raise with you, to decide how to locate that particular district in that State in order to accommodate that injury."
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3940.138,3942.549,"Well, don't they have to show the Gingles factors?"
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3942.549,3943.07,They would show it.
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3943.07,3945.181,"Well, I--"
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3945.181,3945.972,We're talking about--

1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3956.908,3957.76,--Yes.
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3957.76,3958.32,--or unimportant?
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3958.32,3966.357,"I would submit, the way we have proceeded with the Gingles factors... and this is the compactness that the Court has talked about here today."
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3973.14,3994.424,"But you see, what... where we are, Mr. Chambers... as you know this as well or better than I, two very volatile areas, race and politics, in which there has been no long tradition or settled juridical principles about what are neutral, fair, adequate districting considerations."
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,4016.08,4017.432,"That's not what I said, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4058.878,4060.679,But that leads us just to proportional representation--
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,4060.679,4061.17,"--No, it doesn't."
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4061.17,4075.198,"--and quite apart from the section 2, which points in these different directions, quite apart from there, it seems to me proportional representation is the last thing that you should argue for--"
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,4075.198,4077.158,I'm not arguing for proportional representation.
1995.94-923,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4077.158,4078.92,"--that it's ultimately very, very dangerous and divisive."
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,4078.92,4081.902,"Your Honor, I'm not arguing for proportional representation."
1995.94-923,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4106.036,4107.398,"Thank you, Mr. Chambers."
1995.94-923,3,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,4107.398,4108.099,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.94-923,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4108.099,4109.419,"Mr. Bender, we'll hear from you."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4109.419,4115.242,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-923,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4204.021,4218.142,"Is it the case that if, in fact, those criteria are met... you see, what... I find it quite difficult, because there's a constitutional principle that you're permitted to do this when there's a compelling need, and then it has to be narrowly tailored."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4264.0,4264.873,"Well, I think that's exactly right."
1995.94-923,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4277.609,4281.833,"Well, Justice Breyer's question asked you about the creation of a white district."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4283.753,4285.475,"No, not a district based on race."
1995.94-923,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4329.715,4349.035,"Well, the problem... the problem, of course, is the Fourteen Amendment and its prohibition that the State not act on the basis of race alone in handing out public benefits, or in drawing district lines, or whatever it is."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4355.591,4371.482,"--Well, I think in this area, Justice O'Connor, the State can act on the basis of race in order to create a majority minority district in order to counteract the effects of past voting discrimination, which was present in North Carolina for a long time, and the legacy of that discrimination, which is the polarized voting."
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4374.344,4382.299,"Mr. Bender, what are the two districts, the two Gingles Gingles concentrated districts that you rely on for this compulsion?"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4384.389,4385.341,--There are not--
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4385.341,4386.389,Not two in different programs.
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4386.389,4390.273,"--As far as we can tell, there were not two majority black districts."
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4390.273,4394.426,Yet that is what this strange configuration--
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4394.426,4395.475,This is the majority--
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4395.475,4396.427,"--was intended to create, right?"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4396.427,4402.131,--But the obligation under Gingles is to create a minority opportunity district.
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4404.174,4414.569,But this degree of departure from normal districting principles was not necessary to comply with what you say section 2 required.
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4414.569,4417.07,"That's right, but that would have forced the State--"
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4417.07,4435.242,"You could have had a much more concentrated second district if you were only going for majority minority, but instead, the State chose to go for two majority black districts in spite of the fact that no one has given us any indication of why the failure to have a second majority black district could possibly have been a section 2 violation."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4435.242,4436.043,--Two points there.
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4451.094,4453.124,"Whereas the community of interest here is what, that they're all black?"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4453.124,4460.719,"--No, that 80 percent of them are urban, and the State deliberately decided to create an 80 percent urban district here, and an 80 percent rural district here, as a purpose."
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4460.719,4461.349,In figuring it out--
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4461.349,4461.95,Yes.
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4461.95,4469.293,"--did they take into account minority, or did they punch into the computer just black?"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4469.293,4471.366,In doing this--
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4471.366,4472.446,"Yes, in figuring out this strange scheme."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4472.446,4474.119,"--I don't know what they punched into the computer, but they--"
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4474.119,4485.095,"My impression is that they punched in... that they punched in black, that they were looking specifically for two majority black districts, and there is no justification that anyone has asserted under section 2 for punching that into the computer."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4485.095,4485.526,"--No, there is."
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4537.939,4544.084,What about the other minorities that form the almost majority in the concentrated district that was identified but not used?
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4546.545,4547.887,You're talking about the district--
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4547.887,4548.287,Yes.
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4551.657,4552.288,--Yes.
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4552.288,4560.205,"Almost a majority, though not even a majority, much less a majority black, but you formed that out of a district in which only 42 percent were black."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4560.205,4563.488,That district would have had about 42 percent black.
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4563.488,4563.675,"Well, what xx--"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4563.675,4572.902,"But that would have been a district in which minorities would have had a fair opportunity to have candidates of choice elected, because they would have had a sizeable enough population so that with a right cross over voting--"
1995.94-923,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4572.902,4583.44,"--And the theory is that Hispanics and Indians in that concentrated district, their interests will be well enough taken care of by the all black district in the northern part of the city."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4583.44,4592.135,"--There was evidence, I believe, that the two groups voted as a cohesive minority, and all of those factors are perfectly relevant, completely relevant, necessarily relevant under section 2."
1995.94-923,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4616.77,4618.042,Do those principles--
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4618.042,4618.974,You can't force them to give those up.
1995.94-923,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4618.974,4621.294,--Do those principles have to be historically justified?
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4621.294,4623.845,Those nonracial principles?
1995.94-923,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4623.845,4626.047,"Yes, urban with urban, rural with rural?"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4626.047,4628.578,I don't think they have to be historically justified.
1995.94-923,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4632.69,4643.348,"Didn't you refer to traditional principles, and wasn't... I assume the reason we did so was that we assume the... if there is tradition behind the principles, they are less manipulable--"
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4643.348,4644.319,I agree.
1995.94-923,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4644.319,4645.07,--to come out... yes.
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4645.07,4664.923,"Tradition is a very good way of showing that they weren't done here for racial reasons, but if you are convinced, as the court was in this case, that they are not done for racial reasons, I don't think the fact that this is the first time they decided that they needed to have an urban district because of urban problems that had recently arisen and they think that it's important for those people to vote together, I don't think the fact that that's just happened in the last 10 years should disqualify them from doing it."
1995.94-923,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4664.923,4672.679,"Suppose a State passed a law, and the law said, we can use incumbency protection as a principle except in one instance."
1995.94-923,4,37685,paul_bender,,4679.041,4680.653,I think it would be unconstitutional.
1995.94-923,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4680.653,4682.146,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
