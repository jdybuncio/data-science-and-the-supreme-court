2010.09-329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-329, Chase Bank v. McCoy."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,8.856,11.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-329,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,36.173,36.889,Mr. Waxman?
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,36.889,37.923,"Yes, Justice Kagan?"
2010.09-329,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,37.923,46.879,Can I ask you about the deference that we should give to the briefs that have been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief in this case?
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,120.493,123.545,A lot of the above.
2010.09-329,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,147.494,151.798,"Absolutely right, Mr. Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a sentence or two."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,157.218,163.022,"Nonetheless, I think those cases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and well."
2010.09-329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.581,295.341,"Mr. Waxman, I take it from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much deference we owe to the agency?"
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,295.341,296.057,--That's correct.
2010.09-329,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.466,342.255,So you think the same deference is owed to ANPR's as to the amicus briefs?
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,345.707,359.616,"I -- I think that if it weren't for the amicus briefs in this case which are later in time and address the very specific question that is presented in this case, our deference would be appropriate."
2010.09-329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,402.226,402.812,So I suppose--
2010.09-329,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,402.812,408.716,Judge Cudahy in dissent relied very much on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,408.716,409.249,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-329,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.799,417.12,Judge Cudahy in dissent relied considerable -- put considerable reliance on the ANPR.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,417.12,417.738,--Yes.
2010.09-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.909,465.136,"Of course -- I suppose, having done it twice before, we could in this case apply Auer without explaining why it is that Auer is not inconsistent with Mead, right?"
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,466.786,467.386,--Sure.
2010.09-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.92,468.487,Absolutely.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,468.487,473.741,"--Or you could -- you could explain that it is not in any way inconsistent with Mead, because Mead--"
2010.09-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.741,475.391,"That's a lot more trouble, though."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,478.126,481.395,"--To be sure, but you granted plenary review in this case."
2010.09-329,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,523.139,527.293,But Mead did put a lot of emphasis on procedural formality.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,548.89,549.857,I don't--
2010.09-329,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,549.857,552.008,--This is not an adjudication.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,560.864,589.534,"--Justice Kagan, with respect to the Mead question, which is a Chevron question, the Board's explanation in -- published in the Federal Register in 2004, and again in 2007, and again in 2009, is a formal explication of the Board's rules pursuant to its very, very broad rulemaking authority under the Truth in Lending Act."
2010.09-329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.534,592.651,"Of course, you can also read Mead and decide what it says."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,606.845,613.065,"Given my chosen line of work, it may be mete for me not to inject myself into this debate."
2010.09-329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.599,614.132,"No, no."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,623.755,637.495,"Giving the dissent its full weight, I had understood both the majority and the dissent to explain that notice -- the existence of formal notice and comment rulemaking is an important indicator--"
2010.09-329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.495,638.514,That is one indicator.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,638.514,642.382,--one indicator of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority.
2010.09-329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.382,642.999,But not exclusive.
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,642.999,645.584,But not exclusive.
2010.09-329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.584,658.492,"Mr. Waxman, why are we getting into all of this, because there is no question in this case that the Federal Reserve Board had authority to issue Regulation Z."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,664.38,665.082,Correct.
2010.09-329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.082,674.52,"So the only question is, so the Board adopts Regulation Z and then a question comes up, what does it mean?"
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,684.226,684.876,Right.
2010.09-329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.421,704.123,"--This is not new to you, is it, this method of proceeding?"
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,722.084,722.801,--That's correct.
2010.09-329,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.863,771.665,"Well, I do think -- I do think, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to be the way you describe it."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,780.873,781.873,--That's correct and it's--
2010.09-329,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,781.873,794.614,"And so it doesn't need to have been precipitated solely by a decision that the old rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't exist."
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,794.614,804.654,"--I agree, Justice Sotomayor, that that -- that one of the two changes that the Board made could be characterized and was in fact a major change."
2010.09-329,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,904.954,907.806,May I ask you a question about how the contract works?
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,957.905,958.622,Yes.
2010.09-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.693,1022.847,Mr. Waxman you refer to footnote 7 on page 29 of your blue brief?
2010.09-329,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1023.731,1024.881,"Oh, gosh, I hope I have this right."
2010.09-329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.251,1030.768,"Oh, of the petition, all right."
2010.09-329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1030.768,1031.787,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1049.748,1052.064,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1113.405,1120.861,"I take it, apart from the amendment to the rule, you think those circumstances provide for Chevron/Auer deference."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1120.861,1122.261,I do.
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1128.648,1130.633,Our Long Island health care case?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1130.633,1141.758,"--It's an Auer case, and we believe that all of these provisions, certainly the staff commentary deserves deference, and that was the holding of this Court in the Milholland, in the Milholland case."
2010.09-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.416,1158.101,"Well, you know, we don't -- we don't do that with Congress."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1180.133,1192.357,"--Well, this Board -- this Court, of course, in Long Island Care at Home deferred to an internal advisory memorandum that was provided after the court of appeals decision that was at issue."
2010.09-329,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1254.679,1282.099,"Mr. Palmore, what would the Board's position be on the following hypothetical: That a card issuer says when any of 50 different things happen, so 50 different triggering events, the issuer can raise the rate to -- anywhere up to 300 percent, so has complete discretion if any of a quite large number of triggering events occurs."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1293.656,1295.472,"Under the old rule, no."
2010.09-329,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1295.472,1295.972,Under the old rule?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1295.972,1296.608,"Under the old rule, no."
2010.09-329,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1315.736,1333.797,"Mr. Palmore, suppose there was no triggering event, but in the initial statement the company said: We reserve the right to raise the interest to X amount."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1352.159,1352.695,Yes.
2010.09-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.272,1397.474,And when was that staff comment made?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1397.474,1400.509,"That was in -- that's been there since 1981, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.365,1449.007,"Could you address your friend's contention that because the notice doesn't occur, the notice that the increase has gone into effect, doesn't occur until the end of the billing cycle, it's a retroactive increase without notice."
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1449.007,1453.726,It's a retroactive increase without notice that was specifically disclosed initially.
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1488.65,1498.172,But it is correct to characterize what is being allowed under your interpretation as an increase in rates without notice?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1498.172,1499.905,Without advance notice.
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.243,1507.361,"Well, advanced notice is notice, right?"
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1507.361,1507.895,Right.
2010.09-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.34,1529.375,"What would have to be disclosed, just the increase in rate?"
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1529.375,1530.56,"--The new rate, right."
2010.09-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.56,1532.26,Not the reason for it?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1532.26,1532.762,Not the reason.
2010.09-329,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1581.926,1590.432,Did the Board think that requiring the card-issuing company to provide immediate notice would be very burdensome?
2010.09-329,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1599.388,1605.542,"I think it's important to note that in 1981, as we discussed earlier, there was no provision in the Truth in Lending Act requiring subsequent disclosure at all."
2010.09-329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.838,1653.773,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1660.343,1662.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.423,1683.292,Changes the rate in the cardholder's favor?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1683.292,1696.017,"Changes the rate -- the rules, the regulations as they exist as relevant to this case, provide that you do not need to provide notice if the interest rate is reduced."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.968,1710.609,"Yes, but would you -- would it be in the greater interest of your client if the initial notice said, we are going to raise it to the top, no discretion?"
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1710.609,1716.846,"It -- there -- Justice Ginsburg, there would still be discretion."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.109,1741.978,"But it says, we prefer one notice to two."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1752.353,1753.119,Right.
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.911,1800.184,"Well, you know the highest rate, because that is stated in the original notice, and you could shop on the basis of that."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1800.184,1812.908,"--You could, but you wouldn't know that the rate had gone up at all, because all you know is that there's a maximum rate, and the -- and the credit card company has discretion to raise the rate or not."
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.379,1820.58,You get the notice with your next statement.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1824.132,1824.984,--Right.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.284,1828.186,"Well, you get notice if your rates changed."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1829.553,1833.238,"It will -- it will state, Your Honor, it will state on the statement that -- what your rate is."
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.238,1833.757,Right.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1833.757,1837.042,But it will not tell you that the rate has changed and it won't tell you how much it has changed.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.827,1841.594,What's to figure out?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1842.177,1843.196,Well--
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.196,1849.017,"--If he had been paying, what, 10 percent and it's now 25 percent, it would seem evident on the face."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1853.885,1855.171,"--Well, that's right -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1868.728,1888.392,"Mr. Beck, just to clarify your position, if the initial agreement said your rate is 10 percent, but if you are delinquent, your rate will be 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent, it's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case, would notice -- would subsequent notice be required?"
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1888.392,1901.449,"I think if the disclosure was specific and -- and prominent, as required by the initial disclosures, and it wasn't retroactive, then I think the best reading of the rules would be you would not need to disclose that."
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1901.449,1906.334,"So if you don't need to disclose this, and I think that this is the import of Justice Ginsburg's question--"
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1906.334,1906.817,Right.
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1906.817,1920.161,"--what's the difference between going, okay, we will do the initial agreement, 10 percent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate without providing notice; we will go back down to 12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,1931.135,1939.206,"Well, the easy answer to that question is that it -- it's different because the regulation specifies a different result in each case."
2010.09-329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.825,2033.434,"Well, that's just saying that the problem that Justice Ginsburg is concerned with isn't likely to come up, because a credit card issuer realizes he's not going to get chosen by a consumer if he says your rate is going to be somewhere between 5 and 20 percent."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2035.552,2063.805,"--Well, that's -- that's part of the problem, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, because the point -- the central motivating purpose of TILA is to provide clear and up-front and specific disclosures, and that -- that would put the burden on the consumer to -- to look into the fine print to figure out the conditions, and after judging all the applicability of those conditions, to figure out how it would apply and compare with other loans."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.805,2076.529,"And it's fine to say then, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you had and that you explained a number of times was a bad one, you should change it -- which they did."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2106.132,2108.667,"No, definitely not, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.317,2109.917,Why not?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2117.737,2118.356,--Yes.
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.356,2123.825,"--where an agency can interpret its own rules; and if it has authority to make the rule, it could decide that it means something different."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2127.462,2139.436,"It doesn't, Justice Breyer, and -- and all we're saying is that agencies speak with varying levels of authority, and -- and those different methods of statement make a difference in how much deference will go to those statements."
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.66,2154.612,But at the Board -- isn't there realism in this?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2177.561,2188.0,I think that the Board itself made that law when it decided that it would issue official staff commentary through a notice and comment process and interpret the rules in that way.
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.0,2204.045,But the problem with that is when the Ninth Circuit split about the official statement and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent explanation of why the majority is just dead wrong in how it read those official comments.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2219.054,2242.587,"Well, we -- we think that Justice Cudahy's analysis made the same mistake that other courts have made in examining the regulations, which is to defer to the -- the unofficial statements of the Board, the Board or the Board's staff, before coming to a conclusion about the plain meaning of the official regulations, the official interpretation."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2242.587,2246.639,And what about the invited brief in the First Circuit?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2246.639,2251.693,"Well, there is no question that the invited brief is against our position, and we certainly wouldn't argue otherwise."
2010.09-329,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.16,2253.01,You talk about plain meaning.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2258.613,2261.298,"--No, we don't agree that the regulation is ambiguous."
2010.09-329,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.298,2262.365,I thought you did.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2262.365,2263.85,And I would like to talk about that.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.392,2305.244,But the rates -- the rates that may be charged--
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2305.244,2305.977,--Right.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.977,2307.862,--hasn't been changed.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2310.731,2311.631,All right.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.552,2318.118,Ah.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2331.828,2340.333,But even -- even the board and even Chase does not argue that you have to disclose the actual -- the actual purchase rate at the beginning of the agreement.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.805,2378.875,"Well, I think it's at least a horse race, and that brings us back to how much deference you give to the -- to the board."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2378.875,2379.575,Uh-huh.
2010.09-329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.244,2383.946,You are trying to make the argument that it's clear.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2391.2,2397.437,"--Well, I would say that even the government doesn't -- doesn't agree with that, that ""may"" means that."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2600.101,2603.386,Are we getting back to what was my initial question?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2637.524,2639.226,--That's one of the problems.
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.239,2664.889,"It doesn't say ""specific interest rate""."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2672.012,2672.595,--Right.
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.595,2685.319,"And then the staff put out some commentary and says, here's what that means, among other things: That the creditor can increase the rate at its discretion, and you have to give notice."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2701.864,2702.381,Right.
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.381,2703.147,That's a little obscure.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2764.204,2766.287,"I see your point, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.978,2779.297,"I mean, that would be an argument you could make."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2788.986,2789.586,--Right.
2010.09-329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.586,2791.438,"But it's a pretty hard argument to make that one, I think."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2791.438,2793.205,"And we are not making that argument, Your Honor."
2010.09-329,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2825.409,2833.765,"What's left of their arguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous, the official staff commentary is ambiguous?"
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2840.336,2841.97,I think -- I think Auer--
2010.09-329,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2841.97,2844.589,To the amicus brief at least?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2854.678,2863.284,"--I think in that case that the Court would have to defer to some degree to the brief, because that would be the only source of the Board's opinion in that--"
2010.09-329,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2863.284,2868.438,So your case rises and falls on whether we believe that the statute is clear?
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2868.438,2872.657,--The regulation and the official staff commentary.
2010.09-329,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2904.861,2906.397,That's a different question.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2913.401,2916.853,--I think that's right or at least limit that deference.
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2926.874,2936.48,"Mr. Bauer, most of your argument seems to rely on the official staff commentary, but the official staff commentary itself seems to me to cut against you."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,2969.634,2978.39,"Yes, but in that case, Justice Kagan, you know for certain anyone who has a bank account can know what the balance of that bank account is."
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3015.515,3016.882,"Well, on the triggering event first."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,3023.452,3027.406,"There is the discretionary difference, for example."
2010.09-329,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3034.644,3037.529,"Well, I don't see that in the example that's given."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,3046.535,3058.342,"For that I would look to section 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate and the range of balances to which it is applicable must be set forth initially."
2010.09-329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3180.503,3182.486,I'm not following that argument.
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,3207.903,3212.605,That's why I am saying the Government is inconsistent because that's what the Government says that it does.
2010.09-329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.451,3282.968,"Thank you, Mr. Beck."
2010.09-329,2,24979,gregory_beck,,3282.968,3284.403,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.403,3287.788,"Mr. Waxman, you have three minutes remaining."
2010.09-329,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3287.788,3289.338,May it please the Court:
2010.09-329,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.711,3376.079,"So in your view, that's staff commentary, the staff thing means?"
2010.09-329,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3376.079,3380.198,Page 8.
2010.09-329,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.198,3380.965,8.
2010.09-329,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3380.965,3389.404,"If you fail to say in your original notice that default is the trigger, then you would have to give another notice?"
2010.09-329,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3389.404,3389.971,Right.
2010.09-329,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3484.448,3484.884,"Thank you, counsel."
