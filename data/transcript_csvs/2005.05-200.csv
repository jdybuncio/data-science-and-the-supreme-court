2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,7.987,10.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.147,85.401,Can you go back and because the... the parties seem to have different views about it?
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,105.298,115.939,"--Under the statute... Justice Ginsburg, under the statute, the Office of Personnel Management is charged with selecting the benefits and exclusions for this particular program and for this particular plan."
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.084,142.506,But that... all that says is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they were okay.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,152.962,158.099,"--Well, it's... our obligations are through the contract, and our only obligations here are the ones in the contract."
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.978,177.678,But that's different from putting it in.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,191.754,195.106,The... I think it makes no difference.
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.856,198.308,I'll assume it's the latter then.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,198.308,209.18,"The reality is that the... these reimbursement terms are in all the contracts essentially of the FEHBA carriers, and as a result, I think it can be assumed that it's the policy of the Government that they should be in here."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,216.852,223.106,But this is a fairly indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,235.397,244.103,"I think the Court's decision in Jackson Transit sets up the framework for that, and that is, that Congress did assume there would be a contract cause of action, but--"
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,244.103,248.324,I noticed you referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of authority.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,252.609,256.228,"--It has not been applied again since then, but we would say it's settled law as a result."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.228,257.178,It's not been cited.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,262.314,270.237,"Well, it's four or five cases that Jackson Transit was built on, for instance, the Machinists case v. Central Airlines, which came out of the 1960's."
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.794,295.785,"Those cases came from the days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that sort."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,301.256,302.708,"No, I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,327.823,331.691,We're not talking about the contract between you and the Federal Government.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,335.929,336.629,No.
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,348.453,354.307,"Well, that may give rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if you will, between you and the employee."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,364.948,370.769,Because the... the underlying terms are part of the Government contract and--
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.769,388.563,"So if the Government says... Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers... okay... that's a contract with the Government."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,398.669,399.819,--The subcontract?
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,399.819,400.871,Yes.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,400.871,403.387,"I would not say it's a contract with the Government, and that's not our situation."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,403.387,415.631,"Even if the provision... even if at some point Congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be... you know, made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,415.631,417.081,It's not a Government contract.
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.9,452.82,But there's nothing in the statute that speaks about a Federal forum.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,487.223,495.879,"--Justice Ginsburg, every other type of claim under this program is in Federal court already, denials of benefits cases, disputes between the carrier and the United States."
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.568,513.054,"Well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit and everything rides on that State court suit."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,521.244,534.152,--The reality is that a straightforward Federal lawsuit and a Federal rule that these... these reimbursement provisions are straightforwardly enforceable through Federal claims means that they will... the reimbursement will be collected efficiently and correctly.
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,534.152,547.312,"Could you... following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary brought in State court?"
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,547.312,558.552,"Conceivably, but the Federal question statute allows us to raise Federal claims in Federal court, and through it, Congress has determined that if the case turns on Federal law, that the Federal forum is an appropriate forum for that."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.552,571.593,"Well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?"
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,571.593,576.347,"No, because in many States... many States don't allow reimbursement altogether."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.882,591.19,"Well, at that point, you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State law."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,591.19,594.742,"--Yes, and we've fought many battles on those fronts in the State courts."
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.864,606.197,But you don't have any such problem here.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,613.384,616.838,"--Well, no conflict is required, for instance, under the Jackson Transit analysis."
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.277,644.238,"--I could see if this were... what we were talking about everything is... the insurance of a Federal employee and questions about coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between the employee and the carrier."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,660.265,666.735,"--Your Honor, there is no... there's no requirement in the preemption provision either for a conflict."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,676.377,685.665,"That would have been a good time for them to say we want a Federal... Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,685.665,690.867,"--Well, first of all, there have... there was no dispute whatsoever that these types of cases could be brought in Federal court in 1998."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,690.867,691.652,"Oh, there sure was."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,703.71,704.743,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.743,709.88,"Well, since when is Congress trying to strengthen... they either decide it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not."
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,711.413,715.867,--There had been no dispute about whether reimbursement claims could be brought in Federal court.
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.536,749.869,That's sort of queer terminology anyway.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,761.558,762.624,--I don't think--
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.624,764.51,We prescribe Federal jurisdiction.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,783.82,792.51,--I think Congress enacted the statute in 1995 against the backdrop of... of settled law that Federal programs are typically litigated in Federal court.
2005.05-200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.625,828.433,I thought that the... the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,863.369,868.873,--But the provision doesn't read simply that State laws defining benefits shall be preempted.
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,882.114,882.514,Is--
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.514,883.497,"Yes, but... but... I'm sorry."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,883.497,892.571,--Is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting State law?
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,917.186,925.208,"Well, I believe there are many other statutes in the benefits area involving the Federal Government from long term care to miliary benefits which have a similar preemption provision."
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.892,927.692,"It's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think?"
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,940.968,945.789,"--It said that originally, and the courts interpreted that to so narrowly that Congress took that out."
2005.05-200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.776,955.394,And I'll put it differently.
2005.05-200,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,963.798,971.552,"--And I would say that that's... that Congress, when it enacted the provision, I think intended something on those lines."
2005.05-200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,981.86,990.966,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,992.816,996.62,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1013.929,1015.581,Isn't there... isn't that a big leap?
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1033.292,1047.818,"--Well, I guess that seems like an unlikely outcome, given that under the express terms of the preemption provision, it's clear that the contract terms are matters of Federal law in the sense that Federal law dictates that they govern over State law."
2005.05-200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1061.026,1069.632,"But wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates Federal rights, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights?"
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1070.418,1079.857,"Well, they didn't do that, but I think as Jackson Transit explains, it's... it's different in the contract context than in your standard implied cause of action context for the following reason."
2005.05-200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1112.945,1125.819,"What... you... you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm entitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to certain benefits."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1140.145,1149.668,"--Well, this is part and parcel of benefits, Justice Ginsburg, because you're right that when... and when an employee asks for benefits, you'd expect that issue to be litigated in Federal court."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.203,1188.059,Suppose there's a dispute in the... in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one party was entitled under the contract has been waived.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1195.713,1199.765,"Well, do you mean in an underlying tort action or--"
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.765,1200.033,Yes.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1200.033,1200.9,--No.
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.19,1219.494,"No, I'm not talking about the... I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1234.068,1235.984,--I'm not sure--
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.984,1237.52,Whether waiver occurred or not.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1237.52,1242.305,"--I... I think that... that when it's a claim for benefits, it probably would be governed by Federal law."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.305,1242.705,Why?
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1242.705,1243.238,But even--
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.238,1256.582,"I mean, the text... the text only... only says, shall... which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1266.187,1268.039,"--Well, it depends on whether the contract speaks to the issue."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.939,1269.139,Yes.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1269.139,1270.074,--insofar--
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.074,1270.924,It doesn't speak to it.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1270.924,1275.895,"--insofar as the contract doesn't speak to an issue, there obviously would be a stronger argument for the operation of State law."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.928,1276.195,Okay.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1286.234,1287.034,--Not necessarily.
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.034,1288.086,Okay.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1290.553,1296.623,"Well, it... it differs from ERISA in the following sense, that in ERISA, ERISA sets forth a cause of action."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.099,1313.549,"Well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1317.286,1325.79,"--Well, I don't know that it's going to be a... a terribly difficult inquiry because of the precision with which the terms of the preemption provision speaks."
2005.05-200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.64,1333.444,"Well, ERISA has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1333.444,1340.966,"--It has, but in terms of... in terms of the relate to requirement, that's true, and I think the Court would apply exactly the same standards that it applies in ERISA."
2005.05-200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.966,1345.602,Do you think there's any constitutional difficulty with the preemption provision in this statute?
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1345.602,1346.002,I don't.
2005.05-200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.703,1349.488,You can make a contract preempt State law.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1350.905,1353.79,"--Well, I think Boyle somewhat stands for the same proposition in this--"
2005.05-200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.79,1354.957,You don't have Boyle for that.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1354.957,1355.642,--I'm sorry?
2005.05-200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.642,1358.261,I didn't think Boyle went that far.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1358.261,1373.021,"Well, Boyle at least establishes that the terms of a contract preempted State law because it was a procurement contract and the idea was that by complying with the terms of the procurement contract, the contractor asserted essentially a federally compelled defense to the State court action."
2005.05-200,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.021,1374.704,"Well, I thought... I thought it defined a duty."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1384.643,1396.934,"I don't know that there are other statutes, but what this particular... particular provision indicates is that Congress thought it was very important that FEHBA contracts would control over State law, and I don't think there's any constitutional limitation on Congress' ability to do that."
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.1,1400.636,I... I wrote Boyle and what I thought I was saying was that the common--
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1419.113,1419.697,--But--
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.697,1422.732,--that we thought it was the contract that preempted State law.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1443.313,1443.529,--That... that--
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.529,1445.415,--which... which is certainly constitutional.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1445.415,1448.7,"--Absolutely that's constitutional, and that's... that's what I mean to be saying because it's Federal law--"
2005.05-200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.7,1450.319,"Congress isn't always precise, is it?"
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1450.319,1451.919,"--No, they're not."
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1451.919,1461.008,Is there any significant variation among the different carriers as to the terms of the contracts they use in different places for Federal employees?
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1461.008,1461.791,On which particular--
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.791,1463.177,Under this program.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1463.177,1464.71,"--There's... there's variation, sure."
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.329,1466.512,Is there a lot or a little?
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1466.512,1469.697,"--Well, there's... it depends on what you're talking about."
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.697,1471.732,What I'm thinking of is a statute.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1495.146,1495.379,Well--
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.379,1497.045,And I'm trying to figure out is--
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1497.045,1499.164,--The statute doesn't give a great deal of specific--
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1499.164,1499.697,--It gives some.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1499.697,1500.581,--direction on the terminology.
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.581,1500.581,It gives some.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1500.581,1501.664,"It gives some, but it's only bare bones, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.664,1502.947,"Yes, I know, but I'm trying--"
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1502.947,1509.068,But I think that's important because what... what Congress has done is essentially to leave it to OPM to negotiate the terms of these contracts.
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.068,1522.91,"--Insofar as the individual carriers write contracts with their covered employees, i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of variation, I would say there's a lot of private going on."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1531.516,1531.8,"Well, those--"
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1531.8,1533.718,And I'm trying to get a handle on that.
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1533.718,1543.741,--The contracts between the individual and the carrier are dictated by OPM in some sense because OPM negotiates the terms that bind the individual.
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.013,1560.251,"So in other words, when I sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee, it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?"
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1560.251,1565.67,"That's right in negotiating with the carrier, and a statement of benefits is essentially the program."
2005.05-200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.144,1578.778,"No, I understand."
2005.05-200,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1578.778,1582.68,--that you receive benefits and then subsequently receive benefits from a third party.
2005.05-200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.724,1600.391,"Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1606.478,1608.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1630.826,1633.326,It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1633.326,1633.659,It... it--
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1633.659,1634.944,--which is common.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1674.402,1674.402,--No.
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.402,1675.885,"Empire, et cetera."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1679.02,1694.364,"Because, Your Honor, in the first instance, number one, uniformity really is not a... a legitimate claim in this... in this instance by Blue Cross and Blue Shield."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.364,1694.947,Why... why?
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1694.947,1695.948,Because--
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.948,1703.052,"The obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1703.052,1703.218,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.218,1713.158,And it's unreasonable to think Congress would want the rights of those different Federal employees to differ just because of where they live.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1715.526,1724.131,"It... the fact of the matter is, is the way Blue Cross has written this reimbursement provision, they will differ."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1793.526,1804.417,"Well, you're saying that there is a uniformity between a master contract between the United States and Blue Cross on the one hand, and Blue Cross and the subscriber on the other hand."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1825.497,1827.949,"I'm not sure what the mechanics are of it, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.949,1831.318,"But isn't that... isn't that crucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1869.491,1882.917,"Well, I think when we're talking about uniformity, Your Honor, because this is a statute designed to benefit Federal employees, that we're talking about uniformity in the context of all Federal employees are treated the same."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1885.036,1888.988,And the United States is treated the same in relation to all Federal employees.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1901.812,1902.346,--That's correct.
2005.05-200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.196,1937.802,"That's uniform in both Alaska and New York, they are subject to the... to the Blue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,1975.527,2009.6,"--The... the uniformity which we're seeking, relative to these benefits, and the... and the argument as to uniformity I would submit to you, at least as to how we treat the Federal employees, is illusory in this case because no matter how this Court decides in this particular case, whether there's Federal jurisdiction here or not, the employees are being treated differently State to State based upon the provision that Blue Cross Blue Shield has enacted."
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.6,2016.337,And I suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in State court or Federal court.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2017.021,2017.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.873,2019.023,But I'm curious--
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.023,2024.277,Your... your answer to... to Justice Scalia... I'm sorry... just did not register.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2024.36,2030.681,"Well, it was incomplete, Your Honor, because I... I had turned around to answer the Chief Justice."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.437,2147.806,"--Yes, but do they take money in New York that you haven't gotten from the other side?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2147.806,2148.156,Absolutely.
2005.05-200,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2151.626,2154.828,But... but there's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2154.828,2156.162,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2005.05-200,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.162,2159.03,There's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2159.03,2163.648,"I have to concede that that's true, and if that is the uniformity that we seek and the only--"
2005.05-200,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2163.648,2165.434,"I mean, that's the kind of uniformity the Government loves."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2165.434,2166.75,--I'm sure they do.
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.833,2170.083,--I... I wasn't thinking of that kind of uniformity.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2170.199,2172.801,"I assure you, Your Honor, that Denise Finn doesn't."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.801,2183.843,I was thinking of the contract... the contracts that the carriers enter into with the individual Federal employees in different places.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2266.663,2274.102,"There are differences in my understanding, Your Honor, from State to State between the different Blue Cross entities."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.041,2314.41,May... may I ask this?
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2327.987,2328.887,It does--
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.887,2331.272,I think that would be their answer to your example.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2331.272,2333.807,"--It... it would be in error, I believe, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.807,2346.532,"Well, if we... if we think Congress can provide that a contract provision would preempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've given is the precise example that that statute was intended to cover."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2346.532,2353.285,"The... at the... at the very essence of that, I don't believe that a contract can preempt State law."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.926,2370.33,"But if... if it does, it would eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you rely."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2370.33,2381.538,"--It... it would not, Your Honor, in this instance because the... the operation of that statute does not affect their right to reimbursement under their contract provision."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2382.355,2385.507,"No, but it affects the amount that your client can recover."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2399.016,2401.035,"--Your Honor, I don't think we would ever--"
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.035,2402.035,"I'm not stating it very well, but I--"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2402.035,2414.759,--The... the situation with the... the term of New York law that I am... that I had indicated would occur during a trial of the case and in terms of my cause of action.
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.83,2423.948,"--No. But the defendant would say, we don't have to pay those damages because they're covered by insurance."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2431.768,2436.589,"Yes, they wouldn't be a party to that suit at that time, though, Your Honor, in... in terms of raising that issue."
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.589,2443.826,"But... but the preemption provision, at least with respect to the rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2453.365,2459.502,"Right, but that wouldn't affect... that wouldn't override the net... the net effect on the... on the person."
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.406,2466.625,"No, I understand that."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2476.631,2477.583,That's correct.
2005.05-200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2477.583,2478.249,What's your--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2478.249,2490.391,"And if the only... if the only interest in uniformity we have, again, is whether the... whether the Federal Government gets its... its money back, then... you know, then the uniformity argument may fly."
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2505.416,2513.006,But the only question that we're considering today is whether or not Federal question jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this suit in Federal court.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2513.006,2538.555,"--And I would submit to Your Honor it clearly does not because this case, involving Blue Cross suing Denise Finn for these benefits involves not issues of the construction or interpretation of a Federal statute, but issue... the issues involved in our case are whether they're entitled to collect the money that they paid three times to the same doctor for the same service on the same day."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.039,2566.724,"Well, I would have thought the issue is whether Federal law governs this--"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2566.724,2567.374,"--Well, yes, but--"
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.374,2568.374,--and they come to Federal court.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2598.443,2598.693,"--Yes, Your Honor, which--"
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.693,2599.243,All right.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2634.616,2651.042,"--The difference is, is in the instance of Clearfield Trust, you had the Government involved in a dispute over their own commercial paper that they issued and a uniquely Federal interest and a uniquely Federal item."
2005.05-200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2671.372,2675.193,"--If the Federal Government were running this program itself, would you make the same argument?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2675.193,2675.943,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2676.143,2686.149,"If the Federal Government were running this program itself, rather than having private entities administer the program for it, would you make the same argument?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2686.149,2709.08,"--I don't know that I would, but I think the caveat to that is if the Federal Government were running it themselves, pursuant to a different statute than we have here, the first thing I think I would look at is what jurisdiction or what the Congress had to say about where they wanted cases arising from that."
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2709.497,2710.23,"Well, they've already said that."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2715.518,2716.52,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2718.253,2719.555,That's exactly what I'm trying to find out.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2733.863,2734.146,Yes.
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.146,2737.183,--arising under nationwide Federal programs.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2755.561,2757.994,"Interestingly enough, the Government has told us that."
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.352,2797.035,--That's quite good.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2797.935,2798.951,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2005.05-200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.951,2800.051,What are you reading from there?
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2800.051,2808.207,We're reading from the footnote number 3 of the amicus curiae's brief at... at page 4.

2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2840.444,2841.128,--That's true.
2005.05-200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.128,2847.932,"Of course, you could say the same about... about any recovery, that a certain percentage in taxes will go to the Federal Treasury I... I--"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2847.932,2858.406,"Well, we can also say... we can also say that irrespective of whether the Federal courts collect it or the State courts collect it, it's still going to end up in the Federal Treasury, and that these are--"
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2858.406,2865.144,"But whether it's collected or not may... indeed, may vary depending on whether State law or Federal law applies."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2869.346,2882.754,"--The problem in this case, in terms of asserting arising under jurisdiction, is... and... and in terms of Boyle also, is that the... the petitioner has failed to point out any difference in how it would occur."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2888.391,2893.561,"Well, presumably it didn't do that because the preemption provision does not rely upon conflict."

2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2919.075,2920.308,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.839,2944.189,Will you quote the language that you're referring to?
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2944.189,2946.958,"--If I can find it, Your Honor, sure."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2969.073,2971.206,I... I don't want to take up too--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2971.206,2971.775,"Yes, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.191,2978.512,--My... my concern simply is that you've made a conclusory statement that elsewhere there's a definition that doesn't--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2978.512,2978.912,There is.
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2978.912,2979.662,--And... and--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2979.662,2980.112,And it's--
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2980.112,2984.614,"--After the argument, just give me a cite so I know exactly what you're... you're getting at."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,2984.614,2985.732,"--No problem, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.563,3018.084,"But how do you answer the question that I think Justice Breyer was... was getting at, that it's... it's a... the... what's in it for the carrier?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3027.024,3029.659,"Being a cynic, I'm not so sure of that, Judge."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.152,3129.287,"Yes, but this is a claim for $150,000 out of a settlement of $3 million or $4 million."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3129.287,3130.056,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.056,3132.506,What was your defense on the merits?
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3132.506,3134.258,To this claim?
2005.05-200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.258,3134.641,Yes.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3134.641,3158.139,"Our defense on the merits to this claim, were we to get there, is that the Government has paid the same doctor $17,500 three times for the same service, and that Denise Finn should not be required to reimburse Blue Cross Blue Shield when they have incompetently, in effect, paid out more money than they should have."
2005.05-200,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3185.607,3191.694,But I take it you're not foreclosed from making your defense or your claim in the Federal court.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3191.694,3193.212,"--No, absolutely not."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3193.646,3196.164,"Mr.... Mr. Stock, we have one loose end."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3210.258,3212.71,"--I don't believe they do, Your Honor."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3239.527,3249.233,"Assuming the consistency term, that supports an argument that the Government has an interest in... in uniformity of... of interpretation, doesn't it?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3249.233,3254.685,Only if the... if in uniformity of interpretation of the contract?
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3254.685,3255.887,"Yes, yes."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3255.887,3267.445,"I think the Government has an interest in uniformity of the manner in which the... the employees are ultimately treated, and I think when we talk about uniformity, that that's what we ought be talking about."
2005.05-200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.445,3281.704,"--Well, I guess you can be... depending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you can be consistent with that contract and still have an enormous amount of variation from one to another."
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3297.13,3298.58,"Yes, absolutely."
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3309.355,3309.772,But if... if--
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3309.772,3310.238,But I don't know that.
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3310.238,3331.887,"--if, in fact, there were consistently only in this remote sense so that the interests which are meant to be protected in the... in the OPM Blue Cross contract aren't being protected at the next level, then OPM could bring an action against... against Blue Cross saying it's not consistent enough, couldn't it?"
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3331.887,3332.57,It could.
2005.05-200,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3332.57,3333.087,Yes.
2005.05-200,2,43324,thomas_j_stock,,3333.087,3334.12,It could.
2005.05-200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.34,3372.375,"Thank you very much, Mr. Stock."
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3375.577,3377.277,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.277,3379.279,I wonder if you could focus on one question for me.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3392.872,3396.574,"It is, Your Honor, under the Grable case that the Court issued last year."
2005.05-200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3441.052,3444.837,You mean everybody in the entire United States gets the same piece of paper.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3444.837,3445.77,--The same brochure.
2005.05-200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3445.77,3447.039,So it's identical.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3456.643,3459.995,"They... by enrolling, they bind themselves to the contract."
2005.05-200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3459.995,3460.428,All right.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3467.834,3468.451,Absolutely.
2005.05-200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3468.451,3473.571,And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3473.571,3474.571,"Under State law, and it should not."
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.962,3486.279,Counsel--
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3486.279,3488.179,Section 4.1 of the contract says that.
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.179,3494.4,"--the... the Grable case said, though, that the Federal question had to be a necessary element of the State law cause of action."
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3497.852,3498.519,Well--
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.519,3502.471,It's only... the... the Federal question comes up only on issues of preemption.
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3504.44,3508.208,"--In the first instance, our claim is an enforcement claim for the contract."
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3512.696,3516.981,"Well, that kind of... that begs the... that's not the question I asked and it sort of begs the question."
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3530.039,3538.577,"--Well, but there are, for instance, seven States that wouldn't allow us to bring the cause of action in the first place, and that's why we need to go back to the question of whether the claim itself is Federal in nature."
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3548.583,3553.404,"My hypothetical that I started with was assuming you have a State law claim, a State law cause of action."
2005.05-200,3,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,3565.978,3567.914,"--Well, the contract itself is Federal law."
2005.05-200,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3609.205,3613.205,"Thank you very much, Mr. Shelley. The case is submitted."
