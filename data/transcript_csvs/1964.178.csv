1964.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,46.946,"Number 178, Ben W. Fortson Jr., Secretary of State of Georgia, appellant, versus James W. Dorsey et al. Mr. Rodgers."
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,46.946,48.012,Mr. Chief Justice.
1964.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,48.012,48.829,Mr. Rodgers.
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,48.829,50.64,May it please the Court.
1964.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,177.428,181.783,(Inaudible)
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,181.783,184.318,"Well, the reason for it is, it is historically in Georgia."
1964.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,254.991,257.696,Now the representation (Inaudible)
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,257.696,258.269,That's right.
1964.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.147,289.793,"(Inaudible) and three districts each of 10,000, there would be three representatives."
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,289.793,290.166,That's correct.
1964.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,290.166,292.917,"One from each district that are elected by the 30,000."
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,292.917,293.643,That's correct.
1964.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,295.195,312.764,(Inaudible)
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,312.764,313.499,That's correct.
1964.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.041,326.194,"On the other hand, if he gets the entire vote in his own district in Justice Brennan's example, if he gets all 10,000 votes in his district, he would lose if everybody in the other two districts (Inaudible)"
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,326.194,327.331,That's correct.
1964.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,327.331,333.4,"It could work the other way around, he could lose all 10,000 in his own district and yet by the 20,000 of the other two were elected."
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,333.4,334.295,That's right.
1964.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,336.788,343.208,(Inaudible) district counties?
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,343.208,344.494,"Yes sir, it's a --"
1964.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,344.494,346.108,How were they elected?
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,346.108,347.7,They are elected county at large.
1964.178,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,384.124,396.457,"(Inaudible) that I see in the record here and that the application that was made to the legislature, this system would have been changed, is that correct?"
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,396.457,399.211,"Yes, I think there's an excellent chance of that."
1964.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.843,436.582,Was there any Bill then introduced?
1964.178,0,38270,paul_rodgers,,436.582,440.073,"No sir, none has been introduced and that's also in the record."
1964.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1066.739,1069.136,Mr. Hunt.
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1069.136,1072.524,"Mr Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1964.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1113.309,1129.366,"(Inaudible) within the lot of districts in Fulton County and at least Fulton County (Inaudible) number of representatives based upon population, would that be a good approach?"
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1129.366,1145.94,"Mr Justice Goldberg, I think our argument would be the same, because then we will come to a sub issue, which is the submerging of minority racial or minority political parties, which we feel is a subsidiary issue in this case."
1964.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1147.744,1157.808,Does that mean that any state is divided (Inaudible) districts into new districts cannot solve the problem by just giving additional representation?
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1157.808,1158.189,No sir.
1964.178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.411,1600.055,"(Inaudible) also has a chance to be part of the 240,000 and they are all -- and they are voting for several senators rather than one."
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1600.055,1601.141,Yes.
1964.178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.818,1613.55,"So, it maybe that while his vote on Senator X might be overridden by the other 240 of the next Senator, he will be part of the overriding vote."
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1613.55,1615.94,That is a theoretical possibility.
1964.178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.94,1618.313,Well it's no more theoretical than yours?
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1618.313,1621.892,"I say it is – pardon me, maybe I did not understand Mr. Justice White --"
1964.178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.892,1626.138,My point is still more theoretical than yours?
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1626.138,1630.571,"No sir, it is not -- it is not more theoretical than mine."
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.872,1723.407,"First Mr. Hunt, the answer that you get in this case as in so many cases depends upon the question you ask and it could -- this could be looked upon as a policy by Georgia to have the geographical unit, the minimum geographical unit, a county you said, a county and in these larger counties to have voters represented not by one, but by seven representatives and to guarantee that those seven come from different parts of that county, but to have the whole county elect him and that would be your geographical unit."
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1734.252,1745.901,"Mr Justice Stewart, it may be correct and I would think it would be correct, were it not for the fact that this is coupled with a difference in treatment between the two classes of senators."
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.324,1749.573,And the other is --
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,1749.573,1774.259,"– the different treatment being given to the two classes of voters, excuse me, along with the language which we've quoted from Gray and I feel that after you have done that, then the invidious discrimination of which we have complained comes through and is recognizable."
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2108.039,2138.764,"It seems -- don't you -- don't you envision the possibility that if the legislature had done it the other way, that too could be attacked, because on the basis that the legislature had determined that Fulton county was entitled to seven representatives and therefore, I as a resident of Fulton county, I'm entitled to vote for all seven representatives."
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2138.764,2139.069,It might have been.
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.069,2143.072,And your system would allow me to vote for only one representative.
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2143.072,2143.396,I think there was --
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.396,2145.047,-- or as a resident of Fulton county.
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2145.047,2151.989,"Yes there was a case in Brooklyn similar to that, was there not, where you could vote for two congressmen in the recent New York case I believe --"
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2151.989,2163.349,"My only suggestion is, that if the Court or the legislature should decide this in your favor then it would be subject to that kind of constitutional attack."
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2163.349,2173.971,"Well, these questions admit of varied attacks."
1964.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2202.408,2217.65,(Inaudible)
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2217.65,2218.599,Well --
1964.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2218.599,2223.181,(Inaudible)
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2223.181,2224.936,That's right.
1964.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2229.336,2231.485,(Inaudible)
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2231.485,2234.174,That's right.
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.973,2239.195,That would be true of course in any amount -- completely malapportioned legislature.
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2242.582,2248.142,"Yes sir, but this is not a question, we concede that the legislature here is not malapportioned --"
1964.178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2248.142,2248.822,Oh yes –
1964.178,1,22492,edward_f_hunt,,2248.822,2250.889,So that question is not before us.
1964.178,2,38270,paul_rodgers,,2329.063,2338.264,"I have no further arguments, Mr. Chief Justice."
