1999.99-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.254,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-401, California Democratic Party v. Bill Jones."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,73.09,76.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.533,140.86,"Now, open primaries differ from the blanket primary system imposed here?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,140.86,143.086,"They differ significantly, Your Honor."
1999.99-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.876,167.257,Well--
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,167.257,168.809,"But they vote within a party, Your Honor."
1999.99-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.809,180.568,"--if we agreed with you here on the blanket primary thing, wouldn't we be casting some doubt on the open primary system as well?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,180.568,207.795,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think that there are quantitative and qualitative decision differences here between an open primary and a blanket primary, and if I could go into that, I think the qualitative difference is that suggested by Justice Powell in his dissent in the LaFollette case, which involved another issue, but in which Justice Powell discussed at some length the issue of the validity or the constitutionality of open and closed primaries."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,241.994,249.952,"But isn't that just a matter of degree, because... simply because the decision can be made on the spur of the moment when the voter gets to the polls?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,285.096,286.879,"Well, I disagree with that, Your Honor."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,286.879,287.137,Why?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,287.137,315.737,"I think that the history of the American regulation of political parties is distinct, and what we have is a history where the Government in virtually every State has operated to try and make it easy for people to affiliate with a party, but in States that have party systems, and California has a party system, Proposition 198 itself, when you register to vote, it's in Proposition 198 you actually state that you affiliate with a political party."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.406,320.014,Isn't that a pretty empty formality?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,320.014,321.486,--I think it is not.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,332.619,332.764,Okay.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,333.748,334.052,I would prefer to have a higher hurdle.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.052,353.065,"--Let's take the example of the party that says, we want our affiliates to be real affiliates, and therefore we want them to have registered as such at least 6 months before the primary, or 2 months before the primary, leaving aside the question of late voter registration for reasons of transience."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,382.248,383.75,"Well, no."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,407.029,419.344,"Well, you may be right on that, in which case I take it your argument is, look, we're going to operate on the premise that an affiliation, even a last-minute one, is at least a bona fide affiliation and good enough."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,419.344,420.875,I think we have to do that.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.875,423.014,And that's different from no affiliation.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,423.014,426.621,I think we have to do that to distinguish a blanket primary from the open primary.
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.198,441.328,Suppose California had a nonpartisan blanket primary.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,465.299,477.182,"--I believe the constitutional issue which we're bringing to you today would not exist there, because I think in that case the State would not be commandeering the parties as a vehicle for... to blend the political ideologies together."
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.881,501.552,"Does any State other than, we're told, Louisiana, have such a nonpartisan system for State-wide offices?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,501.552,502.666,Not that I know of.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.45,565.835,"Are you... is it a consequence of your answer to Justice Ginsburg that a State really can do by way of ballot access, if it's clever enough, what it cannot do by way of a blanket primary scheme?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,565.835,568.387,"I don't understand the question, Your Honor."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.387,588.887,"Let's assume that in a ballot access... that it had a ballot access law saying, we will let the top four vote-getters in the primary, without reference to party affiliation we'll let the top four vote-getters in the primary be on the ballot in the general election."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,594.307,595.937,"It is indeed, sir."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.937,596.315,Okay.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,610.264,614.869,I think the result may or may not be similar to that.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.861,692.654,So you... it boils down to two things.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,706.071,720.277,"--Yes, and on the first one it's not just that there's been no act of affiliation, that indeed, under Proposition 198 itself, when people register to vote they are invited to make an affiliation with another party."
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.493,757.754,"Mr. Waters, maybe I misunderstood the Tashjian case, but I thought that the Republican position there was, we are not claiming that these Independents that we want to open our primary to are affiliating with our party."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,776.932,786.221,"Well, that's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that's what makes Tashjian a much more difficult case from my side of the aisle than this case."
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.053,812.996,"But I... as I understand your position to be, the party can make its own decision about what affiliation is sufficient, or whether it requires an affiliation, and the party in Tashjian made one decision."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,817.474,819.146,That's correct.
1999.99-401,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,820.305,821.439,Do I misunderstand you?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,821.439,825.212,--Tashjian... Tashjian is a slightly... I think there's two theories here.
1999.99-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.445,843.977,"Well, do you agree with that?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,843.977,845.547,"I do, indeed."
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.791,870.642,"So if the State required the Tashjian result, you would say that's unconstitutional?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,870.642,874.645,"I think one could very easily say that that's unconstitutional, Your Honor--"
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.645,874.781,I mean--
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,874.781,888.745,"--and then this Court would have to, or a court would have to go through the weighing process, but I mean, my point with Tashjian is, I think that the... one... the first element I think that under this Court's test that you have to measure is, is there a severe burden on the party's associational rights?"
1999.99-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,906.393,916.761,"--Mr. Waters, are you... suppose the Court were to agree with your position, are you seeking any kind of retroactive relief here?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,923.625,929.987,"We're... the answer's no, we're not seeking any kind of retroactive relief here, and we haven't asked for any in the complaint."
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.607,950.713,Did--
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,950.713,953.544,--this case itself will have no direct effect on those cases.
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,953.544,960.009,--Did you make any argument that this is so confusing that it's detrimental to the party?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,968.133,983.329,"I think the argument we made is just... one of the arguments we made was the dilution of the ballot label, which might slough over to that, but I have to admit, Justice Kennedy, is that it did not dawn on me when I did the trial that there would be 23 names on the presidential primary ballot."
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.67,988.047,How is the order of the names selected?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,988.047,988.439,--It's randomized.
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.491,1002.933,"So you can find a Libertarian, a Democrat, a Republican, and 10 spaces further down you can find another Republican, and 15 spaces further down you can find a--"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1002.933,1006.796,"--Any conceivable pattern is possible, because it's totally random under statute."
1999.99-401,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1006.796,1011.127,--But you haven't argued that this confusion dilutes the party effectiveness?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1011.127,1028.699,"Well, I would focus on the dilution more than the confusion, but I think that obviously one deliberate aspect of Proposition 198 was to invite people to cross over in each race and vote in other parties' primaries."
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.76,1032.861,May I ask something that I don't understand as a matter of fact?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1046.373,1047.977,--The ones who are on the--
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1047.977,1048.328,Yes.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1048.328,1050.138,--2000 ballot for a partisan office?
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1050.138,1050.791,Yes.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1050.791,1052.605,They are... they're self-selected.
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1086.882,1089.721,Must those signatures be all Republicans?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1089.721,1090.464,--They would be--
1999.99-401,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.464,1100.832,"In other words, when you petition to get on the ballot as a Republican, do the people that have to support you, could they be Democrats?"
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1101.994,1108.117,--I believe the answer to that is that they have to be members of the party whose nomination you are seeking.
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.117,1124.259,"If that's the case, then, do you... you agree, I take it, that given in the West there is a tradition of nonpartisan elections, so I guess the State could say, we're going to have a nonpartisan gubernatorial election."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1127.805,1131.254,I do not see any constitutional limitation--
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.254,1131.397,All right.
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1158.046,1163.734,--I think the use of the party label in that situation creates constitutional issues.
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.214,1164.367,Because?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1164.367,1170.632,"--Because... I think the question there... and I guess you're hypothesizing a Louisiana situation, as--"
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.632,1173.246,"Well, I'm hypothesizing what could be California."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1180.462,1191.223,"--I think if the system is structured so that the public perceives them as nominees of the parties whose labels they are using, I think there is a constitutional issue there."
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.223,1195.286,So wouldn't the public begin to understand it after it was used once?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1195.286,1196.416,I think--
1999.99-401,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.416,1198.799,"And then you all said, you know, this isn't really a Republican."
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1201.924,1227.595,"--I think... I think that's an empirical question and I can't answer it right now, but I really think... I guess my general answer to that line of questioning is that I have no doubt that California, although none of the parties before you prefer it, I don't think there's any constitutional problem with California or any State adopting nonpartisan primary elections."
1999.99-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.349,1256.203,What about a nonpartisan general election?
1999.99-401,0,26293,george_waters,,1265.36,1276.622,"I believe a State could constitutionally do that, Your Honor, and I believe... I'm not sure... I mean, there's 50 States, and one thing I've learned through this, that there are essentially 50 different variations of systems."
1999.99-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.781,1311.497,"Your case should be brought under the Lanham Act, then."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1721.356,1728.021,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1757.173,1767.329,Is the fundamental assumption of the amendment that it's for the voters to tell the Republican Party or the Democratic Party what those parties should stand for?
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1767.329,1768.057,--No.
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.805,1778.028,"Well, I'm not sure how that's different from the postulate I suggested."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1778.028,1781.133,"--I'm not sure I understand the question, your Honor--"
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.133,1791.871,Why isn't the theory of this law that it's for the voters to tell the Republican Party what it should stand for in the State of California?
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1791.871,1794.544,"--Well, that is precisely what the open primary does."
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.553,1802.279,To decide the message of the particular party.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1802.279,1803.812,"--Well, Prop 198 is--"
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.812,1807.628,And I just wonder whether that's valid.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1827.683,1830.14,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.136,1856.588,"Well, you could, have an open nonpartisan primary and decide that only the first five people on that nine... nonpartisan primary will automatically go on the general election ballot, but that's not what you've done."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1871.95,1872.866,--That's correct.
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.866,1873.021,That's quite different.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1873.021,1874.636,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.917,1879.817,"No, not select their candidates."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1883.596,1885.705,--The candidates carry--
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.705,1891.369,You could achieve what you're after if you're saying what we want to do is let the people select who the candidates for office should be.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1910.406,1911.799,"--Certainly, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.997,1963.998,"Well, you have to be a Republican that day anyway, and you cannot vote for non-Republican candidates."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1971.186,1972.926,That is correct.
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.926,1978.062,You can determine the Republican Party nominee for one office and the Democratic Party nominee for another office.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1978.062,1980.777,"That's correct, because it's as if each race is a separate--"
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.777,1980.939,Yes.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1980.939,1981.78,--individual ballot.
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.78,1986.016,"So there is absolutely no commitment to a particular party, not even for the day."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1986.016,1987.541,"That's correct, but--"
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.541,1988.677,Which there is in the other primaries.
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,1988.677,1995.874,--Not in any open primary in which they don't even have to indicate what their preference is or what their affiliation is.
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1995.874,2016.631,"What is the State's interest in allowing an ever-changing galaxy of voters in a particular election to tell the party who its representatives must be, quite without respect to the voter's own party affiliation?"
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2017.713,2021.973,The State's interest is what the voters themselves expressed they wanted.
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2046.745,2048.726,"Well, that seems to me almost circular."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2064.183,2065.789,--I'm sorry if I misstated--
1999.99-401,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.789,2071.984,"Just because all the people want to restrict associational rights, that seems to me an insufficient State interest."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2071.984,2074.597,"--The interest is, indeed, compelling."
1999.99-401,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2106.67,2135.457,"Although your criterion may not be an ideological criterion, my understanding, and you tell me if I'm wrong, is that the virtues that you extol are inseparable from a feature that seems to go with the system, and that is, more centrist candidates, so that it seems to me inseparable from what you claim are its virtues, that there is a change in content of the political message of the people who are being selected."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2135.457,2138.236,"No, Justice Souter, I don't believe that's correct."
1999.99-401,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2155.36,2156.17,That's--
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2156.17,2156.967,--What's--
1999.99-401,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.967,2164.539,"--Regardless of where it pulls it, it pulls it in the direction of, in effect, an imposed content modification."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2164.539,2165.577,"--No, Your Honor, I disagree."
1999.99-401,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.824,2178.948,"Well, I'm not suggesting that there's anything in the statute that determines what the content will be."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2178.948,2179.624,--That's right.
1999.99-401,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2179.624,2192.826,"But the statute, it seems to me, is inseparable from a regime in which the popular choice of voters will determine the content of the message attributed to a given political party."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2192.826,2195.273,"I don't think that's right, Justice Souter."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.944,2209.281,"Well, why not?"
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2235.999,2243.124,"Justice Scalia, there is nothing constitutionally suspect about the majority... majoritarian rule here."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.757,2256.747,"I don't mind majoritarian rule at the point of election, but at the point of campaigning, and of trying to persuade the people, you're saying you cannot even have a party candidate who wants to go in the wrong direction."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2259.638,2260.921,--That's right.
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.81,2267.794,"We won't even debate about going in the other direction, because we'll be sure to select candidates who agree with the majority."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2267.794,2279.506,"--Well, Justice Scalia, this is the election that belongs to the voters in which the first cut, when candidates are narrowed, these candidates will be their elected representatives in the Statehouse, or for Governor."
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2279.506,2295.484,"Well, this is the precise time when the party ought to be able to make its own selection for the spokesperson to run in the general election, to articulate the stand and the views that the party wants the voters to have a chance to hear."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2318.158,2318.71,Absolutely.
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.71,2318.874,You do?
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2318.874,2319.889,"Yes, Justice--"
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2319.889,2320.985,Protected by the First Amendment?
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2320.985,2322.034,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2322.034,2323.641,"What's left, if this can stand?"
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2323.641,2335.906,What this Court has done in Timmons is established a balancing test that looks at those important and legitimate First Amendment interests of the political parties and balances them against the legitimate interests of the State.
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2342.261,2350.061,"Well, tell me what would remain after your so-called balancing test of a party's right at all."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2350.061,2368.807,"--It has the right to do just what Justice Kennedy suggested, call for and endorse before the primary or at any point whatsoever, an endorsement of the central committee, or whatever the current party leadership chooses to do, but the voters are themselves participating in the election process."
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2368.807,2377.89,You mean you say the answer is to let the party tell the voters before the primary election which candidate they support?
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2377.89,2378.42,Certainly.
1999.99-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2381.414,2393.342,"Oh, but normally parties use primary elections to let the registered voters in that party tell the party what candidate the party members select."
1999.99-401,1,42756,thomas_f_gede,,2393.342,2405.503,"--Well, in this case you have the voters themselves, many of whom are party members, many of whom are Independents who want the opportunity to participate in that narrowing process."
1999.99-401,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.583,2422.633,"Acne, oh, all sorts of things."
1999.99-401,2,26293,george_waters,,3398.615,3402.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing to add to my previous argument."
1999.99-401,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.024,3407.167,The case is submitted.
1999.99-401,2,26293,george_waters,,3407.167,3408.088,"Thank you, Your Honor."
