2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.725,We'll hear argument first this morning in Osborn v. Haley.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,6.037,9.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.974,105.37,Why is it a wholly State law claim if the principal matter is whether this Federal employee is immune from suit?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,118.108,134.089,"Your Honor, that is true in perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases like this and a significant and recurring subset of cases there is no Federal law question because scope of employment simply is not at issue."
2006.05-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.205,155.102,But that... it's not it never happened as though the Federal employee was off in Hong Kong.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,171.683,178.308,"With respect, Your Honor, that is not the case, certainly in this case and in others."
2006.05-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.777,203.476,"But I think Justice Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the Government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,203.476,214.772,"Your Honor, there may be cases where even if the acts occurred, they were within the course and scope of the Federal employment."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.055,252.096,"But the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,252.096,261.333,"Your Honor, on its face the certification in this case, as in others, tracks the statutory language."
2006.05-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.826,291.833,"Well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,302.248,303.45,Your Honor--
2006.05-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.45,304.92,"""Out of which the claim arose. """
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,315.698,323.204,"--Your Honor, this Court has consistently made a distinction between immunity and the merits."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.029,364.362,"Well how is it... I mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,389.259,403.718,"Your Honor, the Court in Wood v. United States took account of the possibilities of artful pleading and would allow the Government to challenge the characterization of the incident."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,403.718,405.398,But it's not just a characterization.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,418.845,421.597,"I believe that's a characterization, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.597,424.969,Why isn't it the denial of an element of the claim?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,441.322,444.324,"There are, Your Honor, certain cases in which--"
2006.05-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,444.324,445.546,"Well, I'm not asking about certain cases."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,450.398,461.277,--There are cases in which the merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those cases the district courts are fully empowered to make factual findings.
2006.05-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.277,472.263,"Well, in this case the immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope of his employment."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,495.698,503.583,"Your Honor, because a claim of, that the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do it, is not a claim of immunity."
2006.05-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.045,508.006,It's a claim upon which the immunity depends.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,522.075,544.96,"--Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have the same answer to the question, but again, this Court's jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between defenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the alleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of the State law claim is not met."
2006.05-593,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,544.96,565.933,"In this case, if Mr. Haley had said, I had some conversations with the private employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during the conversations, but I never told them to discharge her, would this, would that be something... would your argument apply there?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,565.933,579.664,"It would apply, Your Honor, if, if that factual determination were relevant to scope of employment under the applicable law, namely the agency law of Kentucky."
2006.05-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.664,580.864,"Well, is it?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,610.575,614.195,"There are cases in which there is a middle ground, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.567,637.383,I don't understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,672.716,677.799,"Your Honor, it's Congress that set the line at scope of employment."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.799,684.955,"Well, I mean, that's what we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some ambiguity in it."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,690.876,721.086,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that line does make sense because if the Government's view is adopted and the view of the majority of the court of appeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will be resolved in Federal court and resolved in a procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the right to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.086,732.433,But that can happen when in fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out to be wrong and there isn't any immunity.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,735.646,754.108,"Your Honor, in that situation, the merits will at least be tried under the normal provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions, even if it does ultimately proceed against the United States."
2006.05-593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.108,755.79,"But Mr. Grant, I'm a little puzzled."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,761.043,777.933,"Because what the Government advocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by the Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the normal processes of Federal litigation."
2006.05-593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.867,786.549,Isn't that only summary for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was proper?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,786.549,796.406,"It's for the purpose of deciding scope of employment, but the Government's interpretation of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the case."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,796.406,804.771,It's not for deciding whether removal... I thought the statute says that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive with respect to removal.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,804.771,810.865,"It is conclusive, Your Honor, in those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,819.271,836.271,"Well, what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,836.271,842.245,"Your Honor, it's conclusive where it satisfies the definition in the statute."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,855.484,857.926,So you're saying it's only conclusive if it's right?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,857.926,859.077,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.211,920.047,"Suppose, Mr. Grant, that the district court had said, I'm going to deny the substitution of the United States as the defendant, but I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not going to order a remand until the defendant and the United States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that I deny the substitution of the United States."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,934.016,945.312,"Your Honor, that, that could certainly go to the court of appeals under the discretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or perhaps by mandamus."
2006.05-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,945.312,953.019,"Well, suppose that happened, and then the court of appeals said the United States should have been substituted?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,953.019,975.322,"That would... that would on its merits restrict the district court from remanding, but of course in this case, the district court did enter an order of remand based on its interpretation of section 2679."
2006.05-593,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,975.322,994.897,But your position is that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive... is not conclusive in those situations in which the Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between an event denying answer and an event characterizing answer?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1005.823,1007.874,"The short answer is yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.775,1049.32,"Mr. Grant, these items we've been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1064.229,1065.611,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.611,1069.412,Then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1069.412,1075.897,"It was first in my brief because this Court ordered me to brief and address it, and I was happy to do so."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1102.916,1121.638,"There is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1134.007,1162.654,"Your Honor, on the merits of the interpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why conclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I think the important point for jurisdiction is that this Court has consistently said that even if a district court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that review is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d)."
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.654,1173.852,This is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a Federal employee's duty.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1186.039,1194.325,"Well, Your Honor, Congress obviously knows how to make exceptions to section 1447(d)."
2006.05-593,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1230.469,1243.548,"But here not only, not only does it say that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no mention about remand in relation to a case that is removed after the Attorney General's certification."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1262.9,1264.011,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.722,1317.477,"I would have thought your answer would have been even if, even if the remand was improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal court."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1331.305,1333.186,"That is my answer, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1345.444,1348.626,"If that's your answer, can I go back to the other main issue for a second?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1388.624,1392.385,"Your Honor, with respect, I believe the Attorney General said just the opposite, that--"
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.385,1396.679,"In the district court he didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the scope of his employment?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1400.993,1401.791,--Your Honor--
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.791,1403.343,In the district court I thought he said that.
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1403.343,1409.608,"--The Attorney General's submission, the Government's submission in the district court was that nothing happened."
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.608,1415.76,"Well, it was there first, but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think nothing happened."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1429.379,1433.143,"Your Honor, the Government did make what it called an alternative argument."
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1433.143,1440.757,"Well, why can't they do that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if anybody, you know, thinks that's valid?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1453.186,1469.745,"The district court, the very same district court that the Government so, so desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said that given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of perjury, it would not accept that alternative."
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.745,1471.017,"But it's wrong in that, isn't it?"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1471.017,1475.069,"Well, the Government did not appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact--"
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.069,1482.445,"I mean, the Wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's outside the scope."
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1509.453,1510.763,"--Your Honor, the Government--"
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1510.763,1515.116,"What's the problem with... there should be a problem with what I say from your point of view, so--"
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1515.116,1540.241,"--I think the problem is in the record, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the, at the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its own appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that brief says the memorandum of understanding between the Forest Service and the private respondent showed that if Haley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted outside the scope of his employment."
2006.05-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.195,1546.366,--So you're saying they have abandoned the argument?
2006.05-593,0,22323,eric_grant,,1546.366,1552.51,--They have Your Honor and the court of appeals recognized that on page 3a of the petition appendix.
2006.05-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.113,1557.084,"Thank you, Mr. Grant."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1559.185,1566.99,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.203,1626.097,"So what if the Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1627.029,1639.127,"Well, I think that the, the... that would probably be a defect in removal procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even if it is--"
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.127,1642.28,"No, no, on the procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's just wrong."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1649.433,1661.383,"--Well, Your Honor even if that is a case that would be removed without jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this case because this case--"
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1661.383,1668.116,"Yes, this one is a civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just trying to understand how broad your argument that this is not subject to further review goes."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1668.116,1678.544,"--Well, the issue that is not subject to further review for purposes of jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification that the employee was acting within scope."
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.507,1721.621,Well I thought your analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back and read the statute.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1733.71,1750.62,"Well if anything the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall act provides that the Attorney General is to certify that at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose the employee was acting within the scope."
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.601,1777.698,"But yet that would be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney General can certify that the employee did not do anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's phrased in the affirmative."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1781.049,1781.81,That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.838,1796.21,So that's the issue then.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1864.215,1870.158,"--You are correct that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can certify in that case."
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.509,1891.862,"That was the position of the district court, though, wasn't it?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1891.862,1897.475,"That was the position of the district court, although I don't think the Petitioner is now advocating that view."
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.655,1944.546,The basic point I think in Wood is this.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1987.855,1992.477,The... I think I do.
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.099,1994.34,All right.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1995.349,2007.958,"--In our view, it would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent employee would be deprived of the benefits of the Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple--"
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.958,2009.901,I was talking really about practicality of it.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2034.395,2037.337,"--Well, I don't think that that could be the end of it."
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.385,2127.257,"And as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2128.967,2130.169,"--Well, if the employee--"
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.169,2133.641,The only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2133.641,2143.876,"--If the employee was acting within the scope of the employment when she wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her hand at all."
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.876,2155.166,"No, not a fortiori, for the reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the Government to defend him no matter what he did."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2178.181,2190.937,"But Congress made, established an absolute immunity where the employee was acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner agrees that scope of employment is the essential question for immunity."
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2210.84,2214.923,But what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2237.777,2259.903,"Your Honor, the Congress enacted the Westfall Act against the presumption of regularity of Federal officials and that is of course what this Court has often said as well, and so I don't think we should construe the statute on the presumption that the Attorney General would, would certify ridiculous cases."
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2259.903,2274.762,"Well what about the, Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee working within the scope of his employment or was he off on a frolic of his own?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2304.702,2306.062,That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.242,2326.037,"I thought that that case was about, was the certification reviewable?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2326.037,2327.176,That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.278,2362.078,But the Court said that that could be reviewed.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2362.078,2363.31,That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.525,2371.926,Right.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2371.926,2374.737,It is conclusive for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.737,2375.639,What does that mean?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2393.08,2393.951,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.712,2399.014,"Where, where does that come from?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2399.014,2410.071,"--Well, the procedure for what happens upon the district court's review is not spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review itself in particular."
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.163,2423.52,"Maybe the United States should remain the party defendant and the United States should pay which would be the, you know, the price of the Attorney General's certification."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2425.761,2441.282,"--Well, the uniform view of the lower courts is that when the certification is overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a pendent claim."
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.485,2485.281,"Well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2485.281,2485.871,--That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.245,2501.391,"I thought maybe your answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2501.391,2507.434,"Well, the, perhaps, perhaps that's so."
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.075,2514.459,"It would still be conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2514.459,2522.394,"--By its text, the statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal."
2006.05-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2522.895,2550.871,"Couldn't it be conclusive for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave the district court with discretion to remand on the grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong, and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a pendent claim."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2550.871,2566.813,"--But the... as the Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of 1447(c)."
2006.05-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.226,2573.578,In that case it would be reviewable.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2573.578,2575.188,--And it would be reviewable.
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.97,2597.774,"That's, that's what the district court said it was, though, isn't it?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2600.886,2602.889,It is certainly true that the district court--
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.889,2615.997,"So you want us to review the, the assertion of the district court that it was remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, would be reviewable."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2615.997,2624.834,"--No, Your Honor, because here the Court need not go beyond the face of the district court's order to understand what it was doing."
2006.05-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.178,2667.22,Let me go back to the Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2672.563,2678.818,I don't think that that would be consistent with Congress's intent.
2006.05-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.658,2683.831,It would be consistent with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the case.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2683.831,2686.913,--That is true.
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.233,2729.261,"Then it's more than pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the State claim or send it back."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2735.075,2735.625,--That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.213,2796.264,"Well, the jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2817.779,2818.77,--No.
2006.05-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.007,2862.098,"So you're saying there are two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if you look at that claim which is by definition Federal, then it's fair to look at the original State claim by analogy as a pendent claim?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2862.098,2862.399,--Yes.
2006.05-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2862.399,2862.909,Is that fair?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2862.909,2863.45,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2863.45,2871.734,What happens if the Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State court?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2888.986,2889.267,(D)(3).
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2889.267,2897.482,--the employee can ask for a certification decision.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2907.709,2908.059,Yes.
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2908.059,2914.642,And we still don't have a jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps you or helps the Petitioner.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2914.642,2946.805,"Well, I think that Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for certification over the Attorney General's objection the statute allows the Attorney General to remove the petition to Federal court and the statute states that the district court shall find and certify whether the employee was acting within the scope."
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.805,2956.9,"But in my case I guess I don't think it ever gets to district court because there's no certification, but then the employee can ask the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of employment."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2959.281,2960.142,"He can, you are correct."
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2987.341,2992.193,"But my point is I suppose the Government can just say, we're not going to make the certification and we're not going to remove."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2992.193,2992.754,--Yes.
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2992.754,2996.978,So then the State court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2996.978,2997.917,That's right.
2006.05-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2997.917,2999.79,I'm not sure if that helps.
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3008.596,3022.184,The... I think what that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the court.
2006.05-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.049,3069.377,"Right, but that's the strongest argument I thought the other way initially, that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of his own."
2006.05-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3096.742,3098.364,Is that so?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3119.639,3120.479,Yes.
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.093,3161.645,"Mr. Grant, could I come back for... I'm sorry."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3166.78,3167.609,"I'll respond to anything, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.609,3175.776,--What is your response to the application of 1447(d)?
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3184.581,3189.775,That the remand was not one of the remands authorized by 1447(c)--
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3189.775,3190.065,"Right, right."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3190.065,3191.305,--Not just that it was erroneous.
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.305,3195.519,Wouldn't somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case--
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3195.519,3196.58,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.58,3201.202,"--And wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this ping-pong?"
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3201.202,3204.113,"No, Your Honor, I think not."
2006.05-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.349,3281.434,But the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is nonetheless governed by 1447(d).
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3286.246,3302.459,--But when Congress specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case under 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a court that ignored that mandate from review.
2006.05-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3302.459,3312.434,"Isn't the problem, and maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here, but isn't the problem with your argument is that the statute didn't come out and say you can't remand."
2006.05-593,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3377.045,3378.437,"If I may, Your Honor?"
2006.05-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.634,3401.492,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-593,2,22323,eric_grant,,3404.344,3405.986,Thank you.
2006.05-593,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.939,3429.453,"Well, there was nothing expressed about Thermtron, and yet we recognized an exception there."
2006.05-593,2,22323,eric_grant,,3429.453,3442.01,"Your Honor, Thermtron was a case where the district court did not even purport to be relying on one of the grounds enumerated in section 1447(c), namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.05-593,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3484.579,3493.785,"How about the defense of, I was on the job and everything I did on the job was within the scope of my employment?"
2006.05-593,2,22323,eric_grant,,3493.785,3503.711,"In certain cases, Your Honor, that could be a defense of immunity, but in a class of cases identified by Justice Breyer, there will be an admission."
2006.05-593,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3589.095,3594.41,But then you're left with this question Justice Scalia raised.
2006.05-593,2,22323,eric_grant,,3623.089,3630.195,"Your Honor, I think that's, with respect, a misunderstanding of how the statute works."
2006.05-593,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3643.131,3649.707,This is an employee who said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my Federal employment.
2006.05-593,2,22323,eric_grant,,3649.707,3654.709,--That's an employee who should win on the merits and will win on the merits.
2006.05-593,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3669.97,3671.011,"Thank you, Mr. Grant."
