1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,140.14,"We will hear arguments next in 75-104, United Jewish Organization against Carey."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,145.478,149.913,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.357,241.669,"Mr. Lewin, in you opening statement you said deliberately."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,247.458,259.649,"By the use of that adverb, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I mean that the individuals drawing that line had that as the primary and dominant criterion in their mind."
1976.75-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.552,324.027,"But if we adopt your principle, then I suppose in all future cases like this the committee chairman, perhaps the legislators themselves, could be examined on depositions as to what their primary motive was when they voted this or whey they sat on committee and decided to recommend this."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,324.027,344.426,"I think in the ordinary case Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is a lot of difficulty in determining what such a motive is, that is why this Court has prevented interrogations or investigations of legislative motive, because there is a variety of motives that combine to produce a particular result, and there is really no way to knowing what a legislature has done, but in this case, there is just no question."
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,405.103,412.017,"Here you don’t have to call on any subjective factors, that is what you are saying, isn’t it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,412.017,414.018,That is absolutely right Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.893,428.971,"If you lay down a principle, as you say in this case, that were the primary factor that they considered was what you have outlined."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,444.747,454.718,"I must say Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me that the courts can setup a threshold which you have to meet with the preliminary showing before you can engage in such an investigation."
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.487,486.866,"Now, you do not need to go beyond the proposition that where it appears on the face of the legislative record that this was the purpose."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,492.074,501.762,"Yes, I think it would Mr. Chief Justice and we would accept that test certainly that where it appears on the face of the reports on the legislative record that that is what the legislature is doing then it is impermissible."
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,538.42,552.563,But couldn’t you have intervened in the action by the State against the Attorney General when the State was challenging the Attorney General’s rather amorphous reaction to its districting plan?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,552.563,558.339,"There are two reasons why we could not do that: One is that unfortunately the State, because of the exigencies of time, never challenged."
1976.75-104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.761,641.659,Where is this appears?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,641.659,644.269,Page 173 of the appendix.
1976.75-104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.269,649.969,Thank you.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,649.969,661.224,"The area that we are concerned with in this litigation is the one that appears at the upper most, the northern section of the district’s marked 57 and 56."
1976.75-104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.287,742.978,Would you point out with your finger what you were calling the triangular section?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,742.978,745.087,This section right there Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,745.087,747.281,Thank you.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,747.281,766.903,"Which is in the upper northeast corner of the 57th assembly district under the 1972 reapportionment, and up here it splits between the 56th and 57th districts under the 1974 reapportionment."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.055,937.668,Mr. Lewin did someone certainly misrecord who it was that told the draughtsman of the 74 apportionment that they should have 65% nonwhite.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,937.668,942.057,I think Mr. Justice Brennan that the record certainly contains no uncertainty.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.607,968.494,"Well, in other word, the choice of the 65, the suggestion of his testimony is was that really compelled by suggestions from the Justice Department."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,968.494,973.967,"Yes it was, and I said it is 70% of white, this is at page 105 of the appendix."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1080.036,1094.23,Mr. Lewin Do you think the quota is in every sense mean improper in reapportionment cases?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1094.23,1100.176,"Our initial agrument, Mr. Justice Brennan, is yes that in every instance racial quotas are improper in reapportionment cases."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.576,1146.072,"I think what you just said, I gather you are suggesting there might be appropriate justifications, but that at least the burden would be upon the user of the quota to justify its uses, is that it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1146.072,1165.37,"Well, we try Mr. Justice Brennan, think of possibility where there might be a justification and I am hard-pressed and I do not think that respondents have come up with any suggestion of a justification of something that might warrant a legislature from saying, we will apply a quota in the voting area, because we think…"
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.37,1172.786,Do you think that Section 5 is co-terminus with the constitutional command?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1172.786,1179.031,"Well, Your Honor I think…"
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.031,1183.393,Do you think every violation of Section 5 has to be a constitutional violation?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1183.393,1193.261,"Probably under this Court’s decision, certainly under Georgia and United States and the shift of the burden of proof that has authorized under it -- Section 5 goes beyond the Constitution probably."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.261,1221.63,"Well, suppose in the Beer case, suppose in the Beer case in order to not to diminish the black representation, in that case it was necessary as a statute to comply with Section 5 to take specific, draw a line specifically based on race, and yet no one would have claimed there is a constitutional violation."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1225.51,1231.132,"No, I do not think we are suggesting, I do not think we have to reach it in this case Your Honor."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.132,1252.847,"You were saying your initial argument is that never a quota is permissible, but in that case, in the Beer case it might be true that in order to comply with Section 5 you would have to draw the districts based on racial composition, specifically and with that purpose in mind."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1252.847,1260.305,"Well, the unusual cases, I think the annexation cases or another set of situation where it might be possible…"
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.305,1261.132,The Richmond case.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1261.132,1266.697,"Right, Richmond and the City of Petersburg where it might be possible to think of a reason, an unusual situation where…"
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.697,1275.883,"Well, the reason is that the statute commands it and as construed by the Court and your suggestion is as construed the statute unconstitutional."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1275.883,1281.609,I do not think we have to reach that case on these facts Mr. Justice White.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.71,1289.91,"Well, then sometimes if you do not reach it then you must concede that sometimes it is alright and sometimes it is not."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1289.91,1292.69,We think that certainly a very heavy burden against it.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1292.69,1296.397,"Well, I know that Mr. Lewin, I take to level four but anyway."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1297.874,1298.953,"Absolutely, that is right."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1298.953,1304.917,"I suggest that perhaps in some cases it is appropriate, if justified."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1311.87,1314.564,That is true.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.481,1323.957,"Well, the argument is at least made that we did this to try to comply with Section 5."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1323.957,1325.322,"Well, but the only thing that complies…"
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1325.322,1326.294,"Well, isn’t that the argument?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1326.294,1338.433,"That is the argument, but the only that compliance with Section 5 required was that New York enacts a statue, which it could sustain if not through the Attorney General, through the declaratory judgment action in a Federal Court."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.063,1364.281,"New York had litigated and the effect of the court judgment was that either draw these districts this way or you would have violated Section 5, you would be making the same argument here, I take it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1364.281,1370.098,"If the Court had said, yes you have to draw it on the basis of race with a 35% quota, yes I would."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1370.098,1373.491,Even though the Constitution then required only Section 5.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1373.491,1375.705,"Yes, then I would be making the same argument."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1375.705,1378.309,Section 5 as construed in the play would be unconstitutional.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1378.309,1385.853,"If the Court so held in that case, yes I would be arguing here that that would be unconstitutional, but we think that the Court would not have so held."
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1426.778,1438.496,"Mr. Lewin, do you think the last term’s decision on Washington and Davis has any relevancy to the issue here, purpose and the fact?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1438.496,1440.244,The purpose.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1447.289,1450.934,Voice Overlap).
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1450.934,1457.408,But I would like to be able just to read that opinion again over the lunch recess if I could reply to it after lunch.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1457.408,1461.215,I am just interested in whether you think it has any relevance to the issue here.
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.215,1465.12,"Mr. Lewin, I ask you a question that you may also want to think about over the lunch hour."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1490.41,1503.326,Our view is that they certainly could not that if that were true then the argument that the respondents made based Gaffney and Cummings would be somewhat closer to this case.
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.552,1559.81,"We will let you pursue that after lunch, Mr. Lewin."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1563.859,1567.322,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.206,1683.913,"Well, Mr. Lewin is it that clear in this case that what was done was a purposeful racial slur?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1683.913,1686.998,We think it is.
1976.75-104,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1700.641,1709.717,"Well, Washington and Davis gave us if that principle is applicable required not really affect but also purpose to deny."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1711.927,1726.063,"No, I am saying purpose means that when you take a racial minority such as the white community, overwhelmingly Jewish, orthodox Jewish in Williamsburgh is and you view that minority in that neighborhood."
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.726,1768.638,I suppose when read this record really as that what was done that was done only because otherwise it could not have been a Section 5 clearance from the Attorney General.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1768.638,1768.901,Yes.
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.901,1772.002,And that was the only reason for it is being done.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1775.197,1776.714,We think that is impressible.
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.254,1797.926,"Well, actually it was the other way around, wasn't it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1808.344,1808.875,"Well, no."
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1810.224,1815.636,"And of course you have got the blacks here that we are including among blacks, Porto Ricans only."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1815.636,1820.246,"Well, we are not only including Porto Ricans, but according the New York State Legislature we are including others."
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.989,1905.815,What page this is?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1905.815,1935.566,"This appears at page 12 of our reply brief, and it is at page 11 and 12, it is on page 293 of the appendix in which the Department of Justice says clearly that in their view the Fifteenth Amendment and the Voting Rights Act is not designed to protect Hasidic Jews, persons of Irish, Polish, or Italian decent, none of those are within the special protections defined by the Congress in the Voting Rights Act not all within the Fifteenth Amendment."
1976.75-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.489,1955.673,"But it is not the same thing to say that Irish, and Hasidic Jews and so forth are not protected as a minority and to say that whites as a minority are not protected, is it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1955.673,1966.909,"Well, the whites as a minority in a particular area may happen to be as they are in this case Hasidic Jews or Irish or Italian."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.125,2019.883,"You perhpas say that there you saw the case, let us say, with the purpose to discriminate against in order to disentitle or to diminish the rights of the whites, but wouldn’t you be making the same arguments that the purpose was on a racial basis to improve the situation of Negroes or…"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2019.883,2026.811,"Well, we have never challenged the bona fides and the good intentions of the Department of Justice and the State officials."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.716,2039.466,"Constitutionally not supposedly expressed purpose of legislature was to increase the likelihood of Negroes who are getting to be elected, and get into candidates."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2048.788,2050.333,We think it is two sides of the same coin you cannot separate those.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.333,2052.125,"So, you would be making same argument."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2052.125,2056.876,"Of course, because that necessarily follows, you cannot separate those and the evils of that…"
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.876,2070.502,Mr. Lewin would this have any unfortunate mark tendency to cut against the whole efforts to have an integrated society?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2070.502,2079.83,We think Mr. Chief Justice it mostly definitely does and we have expanded at more length than I suppose I have time now to go into on the harms we think it does.
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.879,2087.831,It does more than that.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2101.978,2107.769,"It encourages them to move into that area, it encourages voting on the basis of race in the ballot box."
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.079,2285.481,"Mr. Lewin, would it be a valid objection to a reapportionment scheme for a legislator to be concerned that a new line would split the clients you represented into two different grups?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2285.481,2288.583,We think it would be a valid criterion.
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.433,2316.173,"In other words, they should seek to preserve existing groups that presumably voters are black but they should not create any new of blacks, is that it?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2316.173,2320.314,"Well, I think they should preserve existing groups irrespective of whether the voters are blacks."
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.143,2326.657,But if they are not assumed the voters are blacks what is the interest in trying to preserve them cohesively?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2326.657,2328.09,"Well, I think there are various interests."
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.39,2377.514,"Well, taking it one step further, if you started with your group being broken in the two districts, could the legislature permissibly decide for the reasons you have just stated would like to put this entire group in one district?"
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2377.514,2381.261,"I think it could, but we are not arguing that it must."
1976.75-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.838,2383.458,Because this made it.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2383.458,2396.796,"I think it may, I think it may because of perfectly neutral reasons that have to do simply with candidates and their availability or accessibility to the voters, and with I think traditional reapportionment standards."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.939,2437.065,Both of legislature districts expressly and explicitly for the purpose of maximizing the number of Republican districts or the maximum number of Democratic districts.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2445.219,2448.694,That this court has sustained in Gaffney and we certainly do not challenge.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.694,2450.824,But expressly they draw the lines on a…
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2450.824,2456.1,"Yes, we think politics is part of the political process; race is not part of the political process."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.988,2521.065,"So, your submission is if the legislature concludes that the whites and blacks or whites and nonwhites tend to vote at blocks and we would like by districting to come as near as possible as to have the nonwhite strength in the community reflected in the legislature."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2528.064,2529.613,We think that would be there.
1976.75-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.281,2584.125,"Whether the New York Legislature had been proceeding on a general Gaffney against Cummings approach but one of their sub-hypotheses was that blacks and Porto Ricans in Brooklyn tend to vote democratic, and therefore, we are going to create a couple of democratic districts and the way we will do this is to include 65% of blacks, Proto Ricans, and others."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2586.247,2599.782,"If the legislature’s objective is political, we think that is permissible under Gaffney and Cummings, even though they may use racial criteria in determining how the political affiliation is arrived at."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.851,2643.015,"Mr. Lewin, I know what the facts are on the case and isn’t it true that after this districting, this reapportionment occurred, the white community in general have not been disenfranchised or its representation had been diminished."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2643.015,2644.922,"Well, I do not know how…"
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.922,2646.757,In the overall representation.
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2646.757,2651.677,"Well, I think from the statistics that I see in NAACP brief there were 43%..."
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.677,2659.341,"Well, let me put it this way, which is a different question and I can see that I guess is the one I really intent."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2665.141,2667.34,I think in Kings Country it was as a matter of fact.
1976.75-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.887,2672.443,How did you do that Mr. Lewin?
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2686.21,2687.391,Yes.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.529,2708.286,"But you are saying that after this reapportionment the representation of the whites had A, been diminished and B, been diminished below their proportional number in the community."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2708.286,2714.01,That is the conclusion I can come to from the Footnote Mr. Justice White but that is not what our case turns out.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.663,2719.053,"Well, I know."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2719.053,2722.819,Really what we say you have to focus on is not what the total was in the community.
1976.75-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.109,2730.876,"Well, I understand your position but somebody else might think it is important."
1976.75-104,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,2735.957,2752.715,I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
1976.75-104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.715,2754.669,Mr. Pollak.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2754.669,2758.346,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.971,2869.119,"Well, does that require an assumption that that is the way it was constructed in the first place?"
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2869.119,2870.31,No Your Honor.
1976.75-104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2884.134,2890.762,But their claim is that you cannot cut them up for a non neutral purpose.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2892.618,2897.837,"I believe that is correct Your Honor and I was just about to go on, Mr. Chief Justice, to the proviso."
1976.75-104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.837,2911.888,"Before you do, I thought Mr. Lewin told us he was not arguing this case on any basis that this is a civic community but rather that this was a discrimination against whites as whites."
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2911.888,2918.086,"Well, I have heard that and I believe that is the alternative claim."
1976.75-104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2918.086,2918.684,Alternative!
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2920.016,2927.786,"Well, I hope that is the basic one because I myself Mr. Justice Brennan have been trying fully to understand where Mr. Lewin’s claim lies."
1976.75-104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.786,2934.177,"Well, to understand that, you wish it were this claim that it sounds like his claim."
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2934.177,2948.669,There have been enough references to the importance and integrity of the community as such to lead me to believe that we at least ought to establish that that could not be the basis for a constitutional claim in this Court.
1976.75-104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.822,2984.828,That was a dissenting opinion.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2984.828,2989.803,That was a dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.532,2998.45,I suppose it would have been binding if it would have been a majority opinion.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,2998.45,3008.034,I think Judge Fairchild would conclude that ultimately he and Judge Stevens were on the same side.
1976.75-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.303,3118.133,"Well, Mr. Pollak then there is the constitutional stature of the claim turn on the racial make up of the County."
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3118.133,3120.162,Your Honor only in a sense.
1976.75-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.093,3134.563,But what about whites?
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3140.684,3148.248,I am in agreement if Your Honor please with Mr. Lewin who suggested that one looks at Bexar County.
1976.75-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.248,3152.247,Bexar it is.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3152.247,3159.567,One looks at it and hopefully one learns to pronounce it correctly Your Honor.
1976.75-104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3182.43,3187.985,"But why would they single out just one county if you are going at it, why not the whole state?"
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3187.985,3195.445,Because Your Honor the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is invoked county by county.
1976.75-104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.445,3199.678,"County by county but as components of what, of the state?"
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3199.678,3217.297,"Well, if Mr. Chief Justice, we were to look at the State of New York as a whole, I have not been that ambitious to survey the entire State we would, I submit, get a formal sweeping demonstration that the State of New York is, like Brooklyn itself, safely in white political hands."
1976.75-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.297,3231.11,"But in White versus Regester Mr. Pollak, the question was at large districts for a county, well, was it not that the reason why the analysis was confined to Bexar County, here you don’t have districts at large."
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3234.091,3243.985,But you will have Mr. Justice Rehnquist is the New York Legislature attempting to redistrict following the 1970 Census.
1976.75-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.484,3352.591,Would you tell me what do you think the issue is?
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3367.133,3429.216,"It is my feeling Mr. Justice Stevens that the Solicitor General has persuasively demonstrated to me at least that building on the doctrine of Gaffney and Cummings, New York would be entitled to undertake in furtherance of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to undertake, to create the possibility of effective political action, by no means a guarantee of it, and I think certainly this was not accomplished here where many whites were elected in minority, in black, Porto Rican majority districts, to create the possibility of effective political action for groups which are not simply the Democratic or Republican groups identified in Gaffney and Cummings, but other groupings of a kinds which are linked politically in the vary way suggested in your opinion Mr. Justice Stevens which I with all apologies refer to again even though it was a dissenting opinion."
1976.75-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.487,3479.565,Are you entitled to rely simply on the Attorney General’s finding as to 1972?
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3489.186,3501.186,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist were there time enough I would be glad to try to demonstrate that the Attorney General was right, but I do not think that is our burden or any of respondent’s burden in this case."
1976.75-104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3521.98,3531.597,What the New York Legislature did accepting your submission in that respect; raise any diaphanous types of problems?
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3531.597,3539.171,It does not in my view raise any such problems Mr. Justice Brennan.
1976.75-104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3545.545,3549.167,I know what the problem is.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3552.317,3580.328,"No, if the Court please, I do not, and specifically if I may say the fact which is the predicate of this case that there was disapproval by the Attorney General under the Voting Rights Act puts this case in a position where a fortiori the State of New York was not merely empowered but obliged to proceed with the race of voting districts in mind."
1976.75-104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3608.554,3614.349,You might have a different answer to that question if the white community had been disenfranchised to some extent.
1976.75-104,1,34943,louis_h_pollak,,3614.349,3629.782,"I think that certainly would bear on the question of the fact, but even as to purpose, the validity of a purpose to improve the possibility of minority political action."
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3974.195,3976.615,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1976.75-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.453,4009.236,What is the government’s interest in the merits of the plaintiff’s constitutional claim if the status of the Attorney General as a party has put to one side?
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4009.236,4022.872,"The government’s interest become then Mr. Justice Rehnquist preserving the Voting Rights Act of 1965, from a ruling which I think would effectively destroy its application to apportionment."
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4092.269,4099.267,"Well, how was districting done before all these problems rose, let us say, 100 or 150 years ago?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4099.267,4101.331,That was done by legislatures.
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4101.331,4106.011,"Yes, but what guidelines, geographical largely?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4106.011,4114.553,"I think Mr. Chief Justice, the guidelines which history shows were racial, political, geographical, reservation of communities, all the shows…"
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4114.553,4120.727,It certainly shows that they were often political.
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4120.727,4142.282,"I think that is true Mr. Chief Justice, but that is why I say that acceptance of their argument I think -- for the reason I say is, you cannot do redistricting without having racial considerations in mind, unless you are willing to forget about the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4440.441,4452.486,"Let us assume that State of New York was preceding on this erroneous assumption as you described it, what does that do to the case, basic issues of the case?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4452.486,4463.953,"I think whatsoever Mr. Chief Justice, I think this case has to be analyzed just as if the State of New York could have chosen to do this on their own, and this for that reason -- wait a minute, let me read my second reason."
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4463.953,4473.863,"Oh, could they do it for the reason that this assistant staff member thought it was…"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4473.863,4486.928,"Indeed, I am willing to except for the purposes of answering your question Mr. Chief Justice and answering Mr. Lewin’s contentions, I am willing to except the hypothesis which is contrary to the fact that the Attorney General told them he would only approve a 65% plan."
1976.75-104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4538.51,4548.96,"Well, is that the Solicitor General that in effect, the Attorney General can take a particular situation and draw the plan and tell the State this must be it, or none other?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4548.96,4556.925,"No, but I suppose you come to the same conclusion realistically by sitting there rejecting plans forever until they come to the one he wants, but he does not do that."
1976.75-104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4559.791,4561.673,"The state does not need to take it, they can litigate."
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4561.673,4572.939,"The state can go to the Three-Judge Court in the District of Columbia and litigate, they do not have to come to the Attorney General at all, and if they do go to the Court, a prior adverse decision by the Attorney General is entitled to no legal weight in that proceeding."
1976.75-104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4596.218,4608.094,"Is it true that the Attorney General in order to object to a plan such as he objected to in this case, would have to make his own judgment as to whether or not there is black racial voting?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4608.094,4622.263,"He takes the position Mr. Justice White which was upheld by this Court that he has to be persuaded, he has to be -- the State must carry the burden of proof with him, that there is no denial or abridgment just as it must be for the court."
1976.75-104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4622.263,4633.497,I understand that but I think that there must be some assumption that there is going to be some black racial voting or the chances of discrimination would be considerably less.
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4633.497,4639.715,"Well, I think whether there is black racial voting, it is one of the questions that he addresses himself to when he asked them to tell him about it."
1976.75-104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4764.084,4765.733,There is a limit there.
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4765.733,4767.0,"Oh, there certainly is a limit."
1976.75-104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4767.0,4769.316,In Gomillion against Lightfoot there certainly is.
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4769.316,4777.626,"No, I was speaking Mr. Justice Stewart of a taking race into account in order to achieve a rough proportionality."
1976.75-104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4783.796,4789.925,"Yes, your broad statement though would include that and perhaps I misunderstood your statement."
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4789.925,4796.54,I did not mean to say that I meant to talk about dealing race as party it was in Gaffney against Cummings.
1976.75-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4796.54,4801.198,"When you say to achieve rough proportionality, what does that mean?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4801.198,4828.805,"Well, a State I think could say that because race is a political issue and because groups in its area do vote somewhere along racial lines, that is going to construct districts, which are otherwise reasonably compact or contagious and so forth as these districts are here, which give a chance for something like proportional representation of the group in the legislature."
1976.75-104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4874.439,4904.143,"Mr. Solicitor General I wonder, are you saying to us that constitutional proportionality so long as that is legitimately and honestly the reason for doing what was done with these districts in Brooklyn is appropriate, but if what was done, was done to fence out the white community then it would be inappropriate."
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4904.143,4909.542,"Yes, if what was done was done with the intention of harming the white community politically -- of course it is true and…"
1976.75-104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4909.542,4921.319,"But who will stand for the purpose of giving a fair representation to the black community, even though it has the effect of diluting the representation of the white community."
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4921.319,4931.978,"Yes, but I think the white community Mr. Justice Brennan cannot have a claim to more, the constitutional claim to more voting representative strength than it has voting strength in the population."
1976.75-104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4944.843,4952.983,"Well, accepting all that, my question is, does this record really tell us why this was done?"
1976.75-104,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,4952.983,4959.054,"Well, it tells us that the Attorney General objected because he thought there was dilution."
1976.75-104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4987.174,4996.037,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1976.75-104,3,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,4997.617,5000.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-104,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5036.246,5048.44,Do you think anything that was done by New York in response to the Attorney General’s recommendation would automatically be entitled to the word remedial rather than invidious or discriminatory?
1976.75-104,3,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,5048.44,5050.388,Not anything Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5182.872,5192.978,What case do you think in this Court supports that statement outside the area of remedy for a constitutional violation?
1976.75-104,3,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,5192.978,5196.921,"Well, in Swann versus Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education."
1976.75-104,4,37177,nathan_lewin,,5458.261,5464.845,I might just take almost just one three points I think that came up Mr. Chief Justice in the course of the respondents’ argument.
1976.75-104,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5547.88,5551.832,Is that a motion for summary judgment as to a permanent injunction?
1976.75-104,4,37177,nathan_lewin,,5551.832,5552.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-104,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5584.858,5591.672,"So, the posture in the Court of Appeals was not simply appeal from preliminary injunction, but appeal for the denial of a permanent injunction?"
1976.75-104,4,37177,nathan_lewin,,5591.672,5594.983,It was the appeal from the dismissal of a complaint.
1976.75-104,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5594.983,5596.085,Alright.
1976.75-104,4,37177,nathan_lewin,,5596.085,5598.435,The motion for the dismissal of the complaint was granted.
1976.75-104,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5626.206,5627.137,Thank you gentlemen.
