1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.326,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-5909, Dock McKoy, Jr. v. North Carolina."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,10.588,15.491,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.861,110.134,"Excuse me, what... what do you mean is still allowed?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,112.667,117.02,"Well, Maryland previously used this method, and--"
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.02,118.462,"Well, maybe, right."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,118.462,119.14,--I think they were the only ones.
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.14,133.882,"Mr. Hunter, is it your position that the Constitution requires the state to prove lack of mitigating circumstances?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,133.882,135.292,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.464,160.681,"But you do feel that the state may say to the defendant, you bear the burden as to the existence of mitigating circumstances?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,160.681,163.683,"I, frankly, I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.363,187.24,"So you don't... you don't disagree with, at least in your position here, that North Carolina may place the burden of proof on the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence to show mitigating circumstance?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,187.24,189.763,"We... we are not disagreeing in this case, no sir."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.405,220.909,"Well, but it... it does seem to me, perhaps I am wrong, that there is a certain inconsistency if you say that the state may place the burden on the defendant to prove it, but... but then you say the question should be addressed to each juror."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,220.909,230.773,"No, I think it may be addressed to the entire jury, Your Honor, but then the entire jury has to find that fact truly unanimously."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.14,284.542,One... one could--
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,284.542,293.939,"And it's that one-way unanimity that was the problem in... in Mills, I think, and is... is clearly, there is no debate about it, the problem in North Carolina."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.939,298.984,"--Of course, one... one could upset an aggravating circumstance in North Carolina as well, couldn't it?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,298.984,301.457,"That is exactly right, I think, and that's--"
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.457,303.048,So why isn't that even handed enough?
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,303.048,322.331,"--Well, Your Honor, it's... it's even handed in a certain sense, but in... in one sense you're letting some defendants in some trials get arbitrary life sentences perhaps because the jury can... one juror can reject aggravation for whatever reason."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.953,324.955,You think that is bad too.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,330.191,334.882,"--Well, if the state... I think that's up to the state as to exactly how they found."
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.876,342.919,"Well, why... why shouldn't that be the same rule about a mitigating circumstance?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,354.839,361.443,"Well, my complaint, and... and the complaint in Mills, was not so much about unanimity."
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.528,386.542,"Well, you don't need a unanimous vote to acquit somebody in a criminal trial."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,392.857,400.744,"Well, if... if... if the jury... if all 12 don't agree that the appropriate judgment is not guilty, then it is a hung jury."
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.744,402.705,Well?
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,402.705,406.176,And I think that--
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.176,408.217,"Then you don't need... well, that may be so."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,427.862,441.072,"--And again, our, Your Honor, our problem, the unconstitutionality in North Carolina, does not have to do with requiring the jury to be unanimous to find mitigation."
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.385,471.956,Sure.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,471.956,483.135,"Further, those 11 jurors, if they were allowed to consider that mitigation, would have found that life was the appropriate decision in this case."
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.135,491.14,So you just don't think that they have to... that they should be able to require proof of a mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,491.14,498.215,"Yes, sir, I agree that they can require proof of a mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence, but I don't agree--"
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.215,500.626,"Well, you haven't proved it if only 11 people vote for it."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,500.626,500.816,--That's right.
1989.88-5909,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.89,506.272,"Well, you haven't proved it."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,506.272,509.905,"It hasn't been proved yet, and it hasn't been, I would say, disproved yet."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,509.905,518.043,But so the party that carries the burden of the proof loses at that... the party that has to carry the burden of proof ordinarily we would say loses at that point.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,518.043,522.285,"They haven't convinced all 12 at that point, but they don't lose, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.665,534.835,No.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,534.835,541.299,"The result is... is that the defendant gets a new trial, there is a hung jury or whatever happens."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.299,541.459,Hung jury.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,553.928,555.139,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.139,555.59,He gets a life sentence instead.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,555.59,556.181,And that's--
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.181,557.453,So this is perfectly parallel.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,557.453,562.147,"--It is perfectly parallel, but it is also perfectly arbitrary."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.951,566.992,Or is it perfectly parallel?
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,575.179,576.389,"--Yes, they are."
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.389,579.451,"So that if the fact is proved, there is no issue about whether it was aggravating."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,588.567,590.269,"Your Honor, as... that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.593,680.689,This happens all the time with respect to subissues that are... that... that are within one major issue.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,718.335,719.267,Your Honor--
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.267,721.367,I don't know why this is such... such an extraordinary thing.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,721.367,732.765,"--The difference is, Your Honor, is that in this case when jurors disagree, the 11 have to look at the case from that point on through the eyes of... of the one."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.072,769.452,"But... but very often, if... if you need one additional element for first degree murder, for example, only one juror believes that that element does not exist, all of the other 11 therefore have to regard the rest of the case as a second degree case--"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,769.452,769.572,Only--
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.572,770.433,--and proceed on that basis.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,771.224,778.741,"--Only if those 11 decide to join that one and say yes, it's second degree murder."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.713,827.278,"But that... that argument would apply to aggravating circumstances as well, necessarily."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,827.278,828.508,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.449,914.421,"Now, how... how would a majority vote solve this problem?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,936.489,939.662,"--Well, I think there are problems with even having a majority system, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.574,947.298,We can't run a legal system; there are problems with everything.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,947.298,948.708,"--is one, you have true unanimity."
1989.88-5909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.394,969.542,"So, in your view, if the jurors had to be unanimous either to find or to reject mitigating circumstances, you would find no objection?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,969.542,981.562,"There would be no preclusion in that instance, because all... all 12 jurors, they would have thought it out and agreed as to what was... whether a fact was true or not."
1989.88-5909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.793,984.143,And what if they can't agree?
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,986.316,996.882,"--Under that system there would be a hung jury, and I should add that in North Carolina where the jury can't agree the... the legislature has decided that that defendant should get a life sentence."
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.243,1146.837,"Mr. Hunter, you keep emphasizing agree on the fact."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1153.691,1156.252,"6... 17, now, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.252,1167.511,"Well, supposing there is uncontradicted evidence that the defendant was 17 years old, and all 12 agree to that fact, and one of the 12 says that may be true, but I don't think that is any mitigation."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1176.569,1178.461,"That is correct, Your Honor, and--"
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.461,1182.572,It seems to me that is much more significant than the question of whether they disagree on whether he is 17 or not.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1182.572,1202.907,"--That is... that is really the second layer of arbitrariness that exists in the North Carolina system that did not exist in... in the Maryland system, as least as I read footnote 8 in... in the Mills decision, where all the jury was deciding in the Maryland case is... was whether the fact was proven or not."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.922,1273.311,"Do you think the Constitution requires that it be a set of questions and answers, rather than a judge's charge to the jury outlining the steps they should go through, and then just a verdict of death or life?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1273.311,1274.904,"No, Your Honor, and I think--"
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.904,1277.255,"No, no what?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1277.255,1279.324,"--No, the Constitution does not require it."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.511,1336.77,"If you had a system without any findings, where the judge just charged on all the points and the jury came back with a simple verdict of either death or life, you... wouldn't have the basis for review that you're talking about."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1336.77,1337.631,"--That is right, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.175,1385.87,"Mr. Hunter, do you think that the question whether an age of 16 is a mitigating factor or not is a question of law or a question of fact?"
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1385.87,1390.173,"--I think it's a question of law, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.173,1392.124,Thank you.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1404.073,1407.675,There are some enumerated mitigating factors.
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1407.675,1407.826,Right.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1412.666,1416.62,"There is no enclosed list, there are some enumerated, and then there are additional nonstatutory mitigators--"
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.62,1431.19,"And you expect a jury to be unanimous in... some cases, that in the whole scope of whatever might be considered mitigating by anybody in the world, none exists in this case."
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1437.244,1438.116,"--No, Your Honor--"
1989.88-5909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.116,1447.893,All it takes is one juror who thinks that... that one thing... I don't know... one thing is a mitigating factor which nobody else in the world conceives of.
1989.88-5909,0,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,1447.893,1461.413,"--The way that Maryland changed its sentencing scheme, even before Mills was decided, to allow... if it is just one juror, let that one juror bring it down and consider it in the ultimate sentencing phase."
1989.88-5909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.103,1563.312,"Very well, Mr. Hunter."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1565.195,1572.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1620.937,1631.425,"Mrs. Byers, if the Mills case applies here, how do you distinguish the North Carolina scheme?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1631.425,1642.451,"Justice O'Connor, I do not read the Mills case as holding that this type of system is per se bad."
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.773,1701.722,What happens in North Carolina if one out of 12 jurors finds no mitigating circumstances proven?
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1701.722,1717.741,"--If one juror, pursuant to their instructions, finds that the evidence does not rise to a preponderance of the evidence, and after deliberation does not, cannot agree, then the mitigation is deemed insufficiently reliably proved and does not exist."
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1719.133,1731.011,"So, that would result, if there is an aggravating circumstance, in an instruction that tells the jury to impose the death sentence?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1731.011,1732.543,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.648,1770.72,And you say that was absent in Maryland.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1770.72,1778.447,"Yes, in Maryland the failure to find mitigation mechanistically forces a sentence of death."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.113,1860.824,"May I question you a moment about the distinction, because, supposing you have a case in which if you just look at the aggravating side you feel quite confident the jury would say this is a sufficiently serious crime that it justifies the death penalty."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1892.604,1894.296,"Well, again, no, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.301,1901.702,I understand.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1906.767,1906.967,"Oh, okay."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.227,1920.788,"But that is not sufficient if they were to consider youth, military service, the fact he was intoxicated, three or four things like that, but one juror says I don't care about those things, I don't consider it mitigating, even though I agree all those facts are correct."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1925.402,1930.848,"No, you do not understand our system totally correctly, then, sir."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.242,1940.622,I understand.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1941.704,1942.815,And... age is one of them.
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.87,1948.909,"Well, you always have some age."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1957.266,1958.188,--Well--
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.188,1965.083,And everybody agrees on his age... but the only issue is whether that age is a mitigating factor or not.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1965.083,1971.267,--That is probably the only one of the statutory mitigating circumstances where we could even talk about the--
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.267,1975.871,"Well, suppose the significant, no significant past... criminal history."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,1988.023,2004.275,"--That's correct, but again it is an issue of a burden of persuasion and the defendant has not reached it, and he carries it, just as we carry the burden of proving that aggravating factors exist beyond a reasonable doubt to all 12 of the jurors, or they don't exist."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.08,2036.007,"Yes, but on the mitigating side, the Lockett case imposes a duty on the state to allow its jurors to consider all mitigating circumstances."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2043.974,2049.167,"--If it please the Court, I believe this is not a Lockett problem."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.463,2108.954,You have to use the words may not consider.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2111.585,2113.889,There is full consideration with our jury.
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.889,2115.418,Mrs. Byers--
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2151.545,2159.559,"I would... well, obviously, under the North Carolina system, all must agree as to the presence of the various ones."
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2159.559,2170.467,"Well, and they... as I have posited to you, that they all find there is some mitigating circumstance, but they disagree on what it would be."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2170.467,2171.469,Under those--
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2171.469,2177.553,How do they give effect to that if they think that the defendant should not be given the death penalty?
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2177.553,2184.057,"--Well, again, Justice O'Connor, the sentencer here is the jury, not the jurors."
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.935,2199.687,So... so that it cannot be considered by the jury as a mitigating factor.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2201.409,2203.35,--It... it--
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.35,2209.554,In Justice O'Connor's hypothetical there are three different possible mitigating factors that the jury discusses.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2226.908,2245.13,"--That is correct, because, again, there was full consideration of the evidence which supports these factors, and if the defendant has not carried his burden of proving these factors to this jury, then it ought not use them in the balancing against those aggravating factors which--"
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.13,2254.237,"The problem with that is, it seems to me, is there really, as Justice Stevens' earlier question pointed out, two aspects to mitigation."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2291.011,2299.238,"--Again, Your Honor, I would come back with the fact that the... it's not each juror; it is the jury that is the sentencer."
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2332.971,2335.886,"Well, of course I was talking initially about Mills."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2353.367,2359.4,"--And, if it please the Court, I would suggest that... that Mills did not go that far."
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.402,2392.405,"But... but that is your system, too."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2407.006,2410.559,"No... no... that... that is not correct, Justice Kennedy."
1989.88-5909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2434.718,2438.851,"Well, I was speaking in a hypothetical case."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2444.557,2446.647,"--Yes, that's true."
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2499.953,2507.83,"Well, what if there is no mitigating circumstance found, and there is an aggravating circumstance found?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2509.33,2526.633,"Then we go to... then we go to issue 4 of the instructions, and on page 14 of the Joint Appendix, or page 14 and 15 of the Joint Appendix, the jury is told to"
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2561.062,2565.786,"Well, I asked you what happened if there were no mitigating circumstances--"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2565.786,2567.448,--And when there are no mitigating circumstances--
1989.88-5909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2567.448,2569.269,--found by unanimous jury.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2569.269,2584.028,"--Then... then the jury still must determine in that fourth issue whether the aggravating factors found are sufficiently substantial to warrant imposition of the death penalty, and they are specifically told the mere fact of finding an aggravating factor does not mandate death."
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.21,2708.472,"Ms. Byers,--"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2708.472,2709.053,--Yes.
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.053,2717.16,--Is there anything in the record to show that this juror did give reasons?
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2717.16,2721.883,That the... that the jury gave reasons?
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.883,2724.226,The juror that wouldn't go along.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2724.226,2729.392,There... there's no showing in this... record that there was a juror that wouldn't go along.
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.845,2733.806,Is there any way of having that known?
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2733.806,2735.428,Well--
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.428,2735.977,Of course not.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2735.977,2739.13,"--I would... I would not be sure, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2744.075,2751.058,"Would you have a problem if a juror, when he walked into jury room, said I am not going on this mitigating business?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2754.78,2759.725,"--Well, there's nothing, of course, that I can do about that, except--"
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2759.725,2764.299,Is there anything anybody could do about that in North Carolina?
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2764.299,2765.501,"--Well, yes, sir."
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.563,2787.228,"Well, if a juror violates his oath, what can you do about it, if he does it in the jury room?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2787.228,2794.735,"--You can do nothing about it in the jury room if someone violates their oath, but I would... I would think that this Court has--"
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.735,2794.865,Wait a minute.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2803.052,2810.575,"--One juror... theoretically one juror could stop mitigating evidence without giving a reason, but I think that it takes--"
1989.88-5909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.575,2811.557,"Well, why do you need the word theoretical?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,2813.94,2842.068,"--Well, when I say theoretically, Your Honor, I think that the dynamics of the jury system suggest that that is simply not the way jurors behave, and I believe that this Court has written a series of opinions that say that the jurors are presumed to follow their oaths, and are presumed to act in a responsible manner, Johnson v. Louisiana, and the Oregon case that I can't pronounce the first name of."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.661,3093.813,Let me just ask you one question there.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3110.987,3115.131,I know of no case where a 65-year old has convinced them that that is--
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.131,3116.543,"No, but I'm just saying it's possible, is it not?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3116.543,3117.321,--It's possible--
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.321,3119.514,And it would not violate any North Carolina rule.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3119.514,3135.996,"--It would not violate any North Carolina rule, but again, giving these types of standards to the jury in finding these mitigating factors helps eliminate the arbitrariness inherent in having different juries determining different cases."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.996,3142.49,I don't understand why the fact that this jury so found in this case will have any impact whatsoever on another trial.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3144.453,3145.652,"Well, no, they won't."
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.873,3163.586,"Well, the standard, as I understand it, is if one juror thinks it is not mitigating, it is not mitigating."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3164.167,3170.932,I think it is more that the... that the defendant has not proved to the entire jury and--
1989.88-5909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.932,3171.343,That's right.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3192.378,3193.209,--That is correct.
1989.88-5909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.209,3196.161,"He possibly could, but he would have to convince all 12."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3196.161,3196.521,That is right.
1989.88-5909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.521,3214.513,"Whereas under the system urged by... by the Petitioner here, if he convinces just one that the fact that he is 53 should be mitigating, that alone will justify that juror in using that factor to prevent the others from imposing the death penalty."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3214.513,3216.326,"Well, that... that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.107,3219.358,And your point is that that seems much more bizarre.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3219.358,3219.889,--That is right.
1989.88-5909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.649,3357.449,"Could... couldn't you live with the notion that you will make... you will require a unanimous verdict for historical facts, like age, or whether he was drunk, or things like that."
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3377.345,3380.006,"--Well, the... the statutory--"
1989.88-5909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.006,3389.553,"Couldn't... couldn't you live with letting each juror give what significance to a... an established fact, that it wants to?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3389.553,3393.193,"--Well, of course that is not the system we have before us here, or even the one that was suggested."
1989.88-5909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.737,3396.425,"Well, why is that the system?"
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3402.91,3409.775,--We require unanimity as to the existence of the fact and as to the eight mitigating factors.
1989.88-5909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.999,3416.139,Right.
1989.88-5909,1,29337,joan_herre_byers,,3416.139,3430.909,"As to the others, we say that the jury also unanimously should determine that, since the jury is the sentencer, is the cross-section of the community, and we believe the whole cross-section of the community should also believe that that in fact mitigates."
1989.88-5909,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.39,3432.972,"Thank you, Ms. Byers."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3436.485,3439.497,"Thank you very much, Chief Justice."
1989.88-5909,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3439.497,3456.68,"Counsel, with reference to Justice White's last question, North Carolina has never contended, has it, that there must be unanimity only as to the historical fact, but that thereafter jurors can weigh or weigh... not weigh on an individual basis."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3458.132,3459.043,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-5909,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3460.453,3470.771,And is... does the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision explicitly come to grips with this and say that unanimity is required for both?
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3470.771,3491.024,"They acknowledge the fact that, as to the nonstatutory mitigators and also the statutory mitigator of age, the jury has to find two things, as this jury was explicitly instructed, that it is a fact, number one, and that it is mitigating, as a matter of law, if you will, number two."
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.024,3503.482,Well you... you say that it is unconstitutional to... to require the jury to unanimously find and... what a person... what age a person is.
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3503.482,3506.735,"Well, I think if, for instance--"
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.735,3509.607,"Suppose, well... say it is intoxication."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3509.607,3510.007,--Okay.
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.007,3517.924,Say there was a dispute on a fact as to whether the person was intoxicated at the time of the crime.
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3525.418,3530.612,"Your Honor, I think if 11 jurors believe he was intoxicated, and that it's an important mitigator and--"
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.612,3531.053,So your answer is yes.
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3532.122,3532.272,--My answer is yes.
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.076,3566.216,What about age?
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3568.949,3574.921,"If 11 believe that the... the defendant's age is mitigating, and only one doesn't--"
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.921,3575.181,"No, no."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3586.801,3598.409,"--I would still... I think that's what was held in... in Mills, Your Honor, that allowing one juror to decide for the 11... other 11... because in Mills, this second level was not there."
1989.88-5909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.023,3604.803,"--Historical facts, yes."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3604.803,3605.544,--Yes.
1989.88-5909,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.418,3614.809,"Well, what if it comes out seven to five?"
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3619.024,3629.603,"--Well, I would say... my personal belief is no, that still wouldn't be constitutional, because they could be preclusion, but it is seven times less arbitrary than the system we have in North Carolina now."
1989.88-5909,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3667.747,3693.365,"Yes, but, apparently the jury is instructed that if there are no mitigating circumstances and there are aggravating circumstances, that they still have to determine whether those aggravating circumstances are sufficiently substantial to justify giving the death penalty."
1989.88-5909,2,35972,malcolm_ray_hunter_jr,,3695.428,3695.559,That is true.
1989.88-5909,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3731.635,3732.957,"Thank you, Mr. Hunter."
