2013.12-842,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.122,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-842, the Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,9.232,11.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-842,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.92,47.279,Aren't those issues of privilege?
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,71.831,74.05,"Well, two answers to your question."
2013.12-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.698,97.041,That's on what you can execute.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,104.896,112.205,"The FSIA doesn't have a provision except for 1605(g), which specifically talks about discovery."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.545,134.993,"In an ordinary State case, let's say, you get a judgment in -- in New York, and the judgment is -- is not satisfied."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,146.566,150.112,"--In Florida, certainly, yes."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.112,153.922,But the New York court has -- its writ does not run to Florida.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,153.922,155.297,The way Rule--
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.297,158.171,"You have to bring another -- another lawsuit in Florida, right?"
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,176.899,187.862,"--Well, Rule 69, which has never been construed in the area of discovery in aid of execution by this Court, provides for discovery in aid of execution."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.046,204.45,But that's absolutely not true because a New York court cannot order execution on property in Florida.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,214.164,225.627,"Rule 69 also says specifically, Justice Scalia, that it is subject to a Federal statute that governs where applicable."
2013.12-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.64,240.575,You're saying that you can't inquire into property that would be exempt anywhere.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,275.233,278.389,"That's -- that's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,290.661,295.038,"Well, what's the reason -- I mean, I read this like Justice Scalia."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,326.181,327.384,I think--
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,327.384,330.353,"And then I think that's the issue, at least as I saw it."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,364.634,368.68,"--If I could respond to some of those points, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.563,387.171,I know.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,425.687,432.403,"I favor saying that ""in aid of execution"" means in aid of execution permitted by the substantive law."
2013.12-842,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,442.399,444.087,But that goes back to--
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.087,459.159,Do you -- do you contend that you cannot levy upon commercial property in foreign countries where those countries have the same kind of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as we do?
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,467.655,472.075,To the extent and only to the extent that the judgment would be recognized by a French court.
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.075,472.512,Of course.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,472.512,474.121,A U.S. court could not levy on them.
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.121,477.838,So you are entitled to find out what -- what property Argentina has in France.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,491.973,500.986,"Well, property that's subject to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is only property in the United States used for commercial activity."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.986,501.392,"No, no."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,521.492,526.443,"But that's a matter of, with respect, the French law and what the French court would permit, including discovery."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.443,527.005,Of course.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,531.972,532.91,"Well, we would suggest--"
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.91,534.83,You're -- you're saying you can't even play the game.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,534.83,535.549,--No.
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.605,551.621,I can't understand this.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,561.709,566.209,--That's a function of a statute which deliberately circumscribes the normal powers of a court.
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,566.209,567.301,All right.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,625.545,629.776,"The reason, besides the language of the statute, is comity."
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.776,633.683,"Well, I didn't find language in the statute that forbids it, but I'll look that up again."
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,638.85,645.473,"Well, first of all, the order here, Your Honor, isn't limited to property that's executable."
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.473,646.411,All right.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,660.25,660.405,Okay.
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,662.554,662.813,Okay.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,664.763,688.487,"--The ""why not"" is because logically, if you're thinking in terms of -- of the statute, the statute doesn't distinguish between the categories that I hope I heard the Court say you would exclude, which the lower court here did not exclude and which the plaintiff in fact was eagerly pursuing -- diplomatic, military, national security, et cetera."
2013.12-842,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,705.528,714.4,"Well, if there were a limitation -- if there were a limitation of that sort, how would the district court possibly decide what could be executed on?"
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,727.425,727.893,We would say no.
2013.12-842,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,731.033,731.736,No.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,742.356,768.813,"I would impose, Justice Alito, a bar that is consistent with international law and practice, that discovery cannot extend under any circumstances to diplomatic property, to military property, to national security assets, to property of a sitting or former head of state of a country, to state officials, to entities other than--"
2013.12-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,770.719,768.813,We're waiting.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,771.312,771.812,--Okay.
2013.12-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.915,797.364,"--In saying that, are you giving up the argument you started to make before Justice Breyer gave you four ways?"
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,844.672,846.282,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-842,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,854.779,858.075,"What if Argentina -- what if Argentina were a private, a foreign company?"
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,867.9,871.836,That's a question this Court has never actually addressed.
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.337,884.111,"No, wait, wait."
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,885.714,887.122,--Right.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,927.031,928.343,That would be a logical reading.
2013.12-842,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.624,935.637,"If we need not, then I'm back to my question: Why not allow it with all these qualifications?"
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,948.631,969.451,"--I want to add that, just as the other slew of examples that I and Justice Ginsburg were referring to deal with specific categories of property that for good and sufficient reasons Congress has exempted and, therefore, you don't get discovery about them, the same is true of foreign state property."
2013.12-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.162,991.755,I found it extraordinary that we did not have -- I think this is correct -- a single brief from foreign countries.
2013.12-842,0,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,1005.984,1015.183,"Justice Scalia, on the question of owing money, one thing that's clear about this statute is it's designed for uniform treatment of states."
2013.12-842,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.467,1045.155,"Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1057.556,1060.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.358,1084.763,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1107.806,1108.111,--Yes.
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.111,1124.138,"But now you're coming in and saying, Oh, there are principles behind the statute that we have to apply that extend -- extend the words of the statute beyond what they say, and they say nothing about -- about finding out the assets of people abroad."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1124.138,1128.886,Our position is that it is the statute that controls.
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.166,1135.555,What provision of the statute controls here?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1135.555,1146.208,"We think 1609, which establishes an immunity from execution, and that immunity from execution is subject to exceptions only within the United States."
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.627,1164.153,So you think the discovery is certainly okay with respect to those commercial interests on which the plaintiffs can execute?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1164.153,1165.543,"--Yes, we do, and if it is--"
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.543,1168.246,So this thing is a little too broad.
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1168.246,1168.508,--No.
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.353,1175.15,"Well, why do you -- I'm sorry."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1175.15,1176.181,If I could just--
2013.12-842,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1176.181,1184.49,So you think they can't go to France with the American judgment and seek commercial property there?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1190.348,1195.532,"--Yes, and that would be a matter for French courts to decide under French law."
2013.12-842,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1212.01,1219.507,How often do you think the U.S. is going to default on paying a judgment and have people chase it all around the world?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1219.507,1223.272,--There are a number of circumstances in which the United States would and some in which it has.
2013.12-842,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.661,1241.936,"But the questions from the Court so far have narrowed the issue to property on which there could be execution in a foreign -- if it were in a foreign nation, and you said, Well, military and consulate."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1268.582,1273.142,"If the discovery is about assets in the United States, but if -- we agree--"
2013.12-842,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1273.142,1278.639,"No, discovery is about assets that can be executed on, but they are in other countries."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1281.606,1284.746,"--I was giving -- no, it is this case."
2013.12-842,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.746,1289.587,"Well, it's this case on the or -- but it's not -- it's not what the Court has been suggesting."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1289.587,1289.931,Right.
2013.12-842,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.551,1313.282,"Clearinghouse, we're trying to get away from this issue by assuming out of the case the military things, all those lists."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1357.215,1361.418,--What is wrong with that is a foreign sovereign is not the same as a foreign private person.
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.585,1374.195,Why haven't foreign countries protested?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1381.754,1387.455,"The State Department has heard concerns from foreign countries, particularly those that are--"
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.455,1389.174,Why haven't they told us?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1391.36,1392.655,--I think they--
2013.12-842,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.655,1399.652,"They file amicus briefs all the time and if this is as horrific as you are painting it, we would have had some briefs from them."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1399.652,1415.74,"--If we -- if we look at the backdrop against which the FSIA was enacted, in 1952 the United States adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity for liability, but it maintained, even then, the absolute immunity from execution."
2013.12-842,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.076,1439.684,"Counsel, I don't have a very good understanding about how this works in practice."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1471.046,1472.045,Yes.
2013.12-842,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.341,1490.069,"So they can -- so the defendant that -- the prevailing party files a request saying, give us anything that has anything to do with assets in the United States on the French bank and that's fine?"
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1490.069,1493.427,"--We think it should be more narrowly tailored, the discovery--"
2013.12-842,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1493.427,1494.692,Do you leave out the diplomatic--
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1494.692,1501.222,"--Well, it has to be reasonably tailored to uncover assets that could be subject to execution."
2013.12-842,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1527.275,1531.317,"Mr. Kneedler, can I take you back to a question, I think it was Justice Alito who asked it."
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1549.842,1552.795,--We believe that Rule 69 would allow that.
2013.12-842,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1567.631,1583.111,"But that's -- if you think that Rule 69 allows that, I mean, my next question was going to be what in the text would put a foreign government in a different position than the -- than when the suit involved only private parties?"
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1583.111,1584.76,--I will talk about the text.
2013.12-842,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1600.931,1615.455,"What in the text -- what in the text puts you in a different position -- if you have that view of 69, which extends abroad as well as within the United States, what in the text would suggest that we're not under that rule?"
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1615.455,1621.548,--1610's exceptions from execution immunity are limited all to things within the United States.
2013.12-842,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1621.548,1630.482,But isn't the logical reason for that -- why would Congress pass a law limiting execution on property in another country where there's no United States jurisdiction?
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1634.352,1640.063,It's true that the writs of U.S. courts do not run to foreign countries.
2013.12-842,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1668.951,1671.199,Just one question.
2013.12-842,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1681.836,1694.394,"It does not because Section 1610 requires the only property subject to execution is property within the United States used for commercial purposes, and that's true even when there is a waiver."
2013.12-842,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.702,1707.45,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1714.042,1715.495,Thank you.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.657,1788.527,"But, Mr. Olson, you have said -- you make this distinction between the exemption in the Act and what can be discovered."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1844.083,1845.833,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.081,1853.502,But this is a note to the discovery rule.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1853.502,1854.33,--Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1854.33,1861.514,"It says that Rule 69, the discovery rule, is subject to statutes on execution."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1861.514,1867.854,"But, 69(a)(2), as one of your colleagues pointed out, is the discovery in aid of execution."
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.046,1939.731,What exactly does that have to do with the issues before this case?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1939.731,1953.882,"Because exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the context of why my clients are attempting to seek information with respect to where Argentina has moved its assets, the lower courts, the district--"
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1953.882,1956.226,It seems to me that that context is totally irrelevant.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1962.207,1962.848,--Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1999.676,2020.588,"Mr. Olson, but this is a sovereign, and as I understand the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, it says execution, the foreign sovereign has immunity, has immunity except -- except when we're dealing with commercial property in the United States."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2033.522,2034.365,"Well, there's several answers to that."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.956,2086.781,"I thought that that goes to jurisdiction and liability, the judgment of liability."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2107.882,2110.335,"That's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.158,2125.062,Could it be addressed to Argentina on your theory?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2125.797,2128.953,"We believe that it could be addressed to Argentina, no question."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2140.917,2142.133,I thought they objected to it.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2143.305,2145.054,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2145.054,2147.443,"The banks, I thought that they objected to the subpoena."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2147.443,2150.474,One of the parties objected to the subpoena.
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2168.264,2176.511,It doesn't seem to me that the narrowing was -- we've been assuming that what we're talking about is discovery related to commercial property.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2183.304,2188.022,"It's asking for bank transactions, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2243.14,2244.687,I'm sorry.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2245.14,2254.246,I just -- the answer would be that if you don't know what Argentina is doing with the property and what labels it's slapping on the property--
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2254.246,2254.981,So I was right.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2268.662,2272.801,"--It is -- well, we don't know what its purpose is until we find out what the assets are."
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.801,2273.878,So just answer yes.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2273.878,2276.907,"Yes, the answer is yes."
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.845,2280.672,"--Well, but doesn't that seem pretty extraordinary?"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2298.728,2302.898,"Well, what -- this subpoena relates to bank transactions."
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2305.896,2313.847,"Just before you get over there, I thought your position was that yes, you can ask for discovery related to, you know, the Argentine Air Force."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2313.847,2315.798,"--That's what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide, that--"
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.798,2344.803,"Could we say no to that and just say, look, here is the difficult question in the case, of course, every subpoena -- every subpoena has to have limits, and the limits are typically limits that have to do with the purpose of the subpoena, and where a sovereign is involved, maybe a District Court has to be more careful, but you are indeed searching for information in respect to assets out of the country that you could execute upon?"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2346.911,2348.567,--I understand.
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.567,2349.737,"If you want to fight it later, go right ahead."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2450.837,2463.52,"Well, and part of the answer is in the Altmann decision itself where you specifically said the views of the United States with respect to the construction of a statute of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, are not entitled to deference."
2013.12-842,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2517.405,2520.31,"Mr. Olson, can I just make sure I understand the scope of your argument?"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2558.497,2559.325,Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.564,2592.14,"Well, that makes it a lot harder for me because I thought you just looked to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2614.084,2614.428,"No, no."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.531,2631.561,"So it includes military assets, diplomatic assets, everything?"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2631.561,2638.45,"--Probably -- diplomatic assets are covered by a separate convention, as we mentioned in our brief."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.636,2641.573,Military assets?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2641.573,2642.9,--Military assets.
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.314,2663.892,No.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2678.261,2686.741,"The problem, Justice Scalia, as any litigant knows, you don't know what the judgment debtor is doing with its assets."
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2689.834,2690.897,"No, no, no."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2711.935,2728.944,"--The answer to that is, to the extent that there's a specific objection with respect to a scope -- the scope of the discovery, it can be addressed by the district court as opposed to a blanket prohibition on finding out information with respect to a judgment debtor who has--"
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.944,2736.16,"Well, in making the rule, we're asking whether or not our rule should take account of this concern."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2740.549,2750.426,"--I think what you should say to the DISTRICT court is what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which were not replaced by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, do."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2771.301,2779.439,"And they are statutes and the rule, whether you divide it into the two parts, the substance is the same."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2794.855,2797.775,"--It says the discovery rule, Rule 69(a)(2) says the--"
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.775,2801.274,I'm talking about Advisory Committee notes.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2801.274,2801.586,--Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.586,2802.445,What they meant.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2818.735,2830.701,"And I think that with respect to that, that provision, those statements of the Advisory Committee have to take -- be taken in the context that the statute itself did not intend to address discovery that's quite clear."
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.485,2859.0,What about--
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.0,2869.091,--Let's assume -- let's assume that New York has an exemption from -- from levying on property.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2887.535,2891.143,"Well, you assume the answer in the question that you asked, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.154,2903.701,Come on.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2917.429,2918.648,--Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.648,2920.554,The same language as the New York statute--
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2920.554,2920.74,I--
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.74,2922.412,--which exempts those homes.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2922.412,2922.677,--I submit--
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.677,2923.161,Okay?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2923.161,2934.048,"--I submit that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would allow a judgment creditor to ask the bank or other persons or even the judgment debtor, what homes do you own, yes."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.048,2935.598,And you think you can levy on those homes--
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2935.598,2936.188,No.
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.188,2937.803,--in Florida even though New York wouldn't let you do it?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2937.803,2942.404,"You could levy on those homes in Florida if Florida allows you to do so, yes."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.323,2952.337,It's a judgment limited to property other than homesteads.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2956.352,2957.852,--Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.457,2966.629,But not from -- not from homesteads.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2966.629,2976.046,"Well, if that's your hypothetical, that the judgment exempts homesteads, I don't know whether the -- whether -- that gets pretty far afield here."
2013.12-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.827,2982.794,"When you say you can't execute on homestead property, it means any judgment in New York excludes homesteads."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2982.794,3002.442,"--A judgment creditor who has a bond in New York City and has -- and the debtor refuses to pay it and gets a judgment from a court which has jurisprudence, then can take that judgment and go to other places where there is property located and execute or attach on that property depending upon the laws--"
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.442,3003.535,"--Mr. Olson, what--"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3003.535,3004.504,--of that jurisdiction.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3004.504,3016.251,"--what about, there are countries that have more restrictive views than we do about what information, financial information, is confidential."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3048.455,3061.075,This Court -- I think it's the Societe Nationale case -- has said that a court can order discovery even with respect to where the person to whom the discovery is addressed says I can't give you that information.
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.85,3077.709,Can you do this in discovery normally?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3090.922,3091.408,--Exactly.
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3091.408,3091.699,All right.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3118.844,3127.342,"Well, that's -- you are talking about an abuse of discretion standard, and when you talk about airplanes that may they be used for commercial purposes, this Court has held--"
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.342,3129.107,"No, I'm not saying that -- no."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3134.026,3135.432,--Well--
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.432,3137.416,Something that couldn't be executed upon.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3137.416,3139.93,"--In this country, I think the--"
2013.12-842,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.93,3141.883,"Be very, very careful."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3144.694,3148.848,--The district court went through an elaborate process.
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3172.279,3173.044,Mr. Olson.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3173.044,3180.869,"--assets that could be levied on in the United States, and that we think is not the correct interpretation of the FSIA or the Federal Rules."
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3180.869,3192.146,"If I am understanding your position, you -- I think what you are saying, the judgment here is only for money due, whatever the amount was."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3199.799,3200.533,Yes.
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3200.533,3209.093,And so any -- any protection to those assets has to be provided by the jurisdiction in which they're located.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3209.093,3210.655,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3210.655,3236.206,"So your position, whether this is a sovereign or an individual, is that if they get a homestead exemption in New York, if the property is in New York, they're entitled to it, but if they have property in Florida and Florida doesn't give a homestead exemption, they can get that home -- they can't get the home in New York, but they can get the home in Florida."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3236.206,3236.721,Exactly.
2013.12-842,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3237.831,3254.323,"And so in answer to Justice Kagan's question, even though there might be a country out there that doesn't make any property immune by a sovereign, then you could go and attach any property in that country?"
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3254.323,3256.4,--Exactly.
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.179,3304.723,How many of the bondholders settled with Argentina?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3308.331,3309.893,I'm--
2013.12-842,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3309.893,3314.438,The vast majority of the bondholders settled with Argentina.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3314.438,3325.902,"--Yes, because anybody who has ever litigated against Argentina knows that it probably may be less costly to just give in on whatever terms Argentina offers."
2013.12-842,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3355.438,3377.32,"If you win on the categorical question that's presented here, do you think it's still open to Argentina to go back to the district court and to say, modify your ruling for this or that privilege reason or because the order is overinclusive or any of these more prudential conversations."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3377.32,3379.475,"Yes, I believe that's the case, Your Honor."
2013.12-842,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3397.593,3401.482,What exactly would a district judge do in those circumstances?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3421.334,3433.594,"I think the judge might ask for some assurances that, from Argentina, that you are telling the truth this time, that that's -- these are really military assets and not something disguised as military assets."
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3433.594,3435.998,Does the waiver extend to military property?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3435.998,3441.465,"The waiver extends as far as the law will permit, and we submit that--"
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3441.465,3447.682,"Well, then the waiver just restates the immunity that's provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3447.682,3448.213,--No.
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3449.024,3450.946,How does it go beyond that?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3450.946,3452.601,--It waives the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act defenses.
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3453.992,3457.459,But not as to military property.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3459.677,3470.671,--The waiver extend to anything that -- Argentina has decided that in order to borrow money in this country it had the sovereign right to waive sovereign immunity under the laws of the United States.
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3470.671,3474.608,I'm asking whether or not the waiver extends to Argentine military property.
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3474.608,3489.806,"I believe that it does, Justice Kennedy, because if you -- if you construed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of prohibiting a foreign sovereign from waiving its immunity, you would cripple a foreign sovereign from deciding that, I need to borrow money and in order to borrow money--"
2013.12-842,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.806,3495.663,Does it waive immunity as to a consular residence or an embassy building?
2013.12-842,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3495.663,3505.3,"--I think it depends upon the circumstances, but there is a separate treaty that covers consular affairs that is different than this, that does provide immunity."
2013.12-842,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3521.917,3523.135,"Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-842,3,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3525.135,3527.352,Thank you.
