1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,245.121,246.595,"Oh, that's correct."
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.119,266.018,"Well, your first point is, the Court should have been the summary judgment in your favor, is that right?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,266.018,271.264,"Well, not summary -- no there was only a motion for summary judgment in favor of the appellee."
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.411,275.462,"Well, I don't quite understand your first point."
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,275.462,282.149,"Well, that -- that on the showing made, the District Court should have rejected the failing company defense and going to a trial of the merits of this case."
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.115,287.208,Wasn't that just one point?
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,287.208,294.814,"Well, we put it -- we put it in two steps, we think that this record affirmatively we showed there was no failing company defense."
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.814,297.627,But are you asking us here to render a summary judgment in your favor?
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,297.627,298.358,Oh no.
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.375,305.435,And that's all you're asking for?
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,305.435,306.2,That's correct.
1961.286,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.274,314.193,"Well, you want us to say that, don't you?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,314.193,315.005,"We do, yes."
1961.286,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.005,319.341,You want us to say send it back for a new trial on embarrassed by the failing company.
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,319.341,320.399,That's what we hope.
1961.286,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,325.4,327.561,Merely a question on the issue of failing company.
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,327.561,328.486,"That's correct, yes."
1961.286,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.486,329.807,"No, (Inaudible)"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,329.807,331.567,Yes Mr. Justice.
1961.286,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,490.149,491.329,"Because, what did you say?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,491.329,491.934,Pardon sir?
1961.286,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,491.934,492.968,"Because, what did you say?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,492.968,495.228,Because of the shortages of cash the company --
1961.286,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,495.228,495.453,Oh yes.
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,495.453,498.698,-- had difficulty paying its bills of short of cash.
1961.286,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,546.03,555.691,"What is irrelevant to that, judgment (Inaudible)"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,555.691,556.447,Why I --
1961.286,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,556.447,560.074,An acquisition at the time (Inaudible)
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,560.074,563.948,I would think at the time of the acquisition Mr. Justice.
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,761.578,766.808,"These are all this -- this data that you're giving us is for the company's books, is that right?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,766.808,769.744,That's from a company's published financial state.
1961.286,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,769.744,776.623,"Now, isn't the -- isn't the basic claim of the respondents that these books were only that they didn't show the correct picture?"
1961.286,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,776.623,777.472,That is correct.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,1669.59,1679.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2039.228,2045.087,When was that audit have made before or after the -- before or after the transaction?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2045.087,2046.32,I beg you pardon Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2046.32,2047.761,When was that audit made --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2047.761,2047.784,This -- this --
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2047.784,2049.009,-- before or after the transaction?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2049.009,2054.233,This order was made by Lybrand Ross after the transaction.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2054.233,2060.079,Were these facts that you're talking about now known to Diebold at the time they purchased?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2060.079,2062.36,They were not -- have no one to Mr. Chief Justice.
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2442.51,2446.34,So they check this from the back of the checks against the accountants?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2446.34,2447.579,They did.
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2486.551,2492.708,"Let's say they went to send the check out of the box, and we thought it had the money in the bank to pay for it (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2492.708,2505.477,"No, if you permit me Mr. Justice Clark, they wouldn't kick the check out of the box into float until they could predict it by the time the check cleared all the banks that have to clear and get back, there would be funds in the bank at time to cover it."
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2508.892,2515.545,You would send the check through the (Inaudible) and he would deposit it in (Inaudible)
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2515.545,2516.06,That's right.
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2516.06,2517.703,(Inaudible)
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2517.703,2518.536,That's right.
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2518.536,2528.141,"And they -- they would (Inaudible) you said at the time, they had to check if it was actually mailed by HHM, he did not handed them?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2528.141,2531.799,They would not have had enough money in the bank to cover that check on the date it was sent out.
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2549.458,2551.674,They're all paid in (Inaudible)
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2551.674,2564.319,"They all paid -- well, after the closing on September 10th of 1959, I regret to say that a large number to the tune of about 300,000 were paid for by us."
1961.286,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2564.319,2565.914,Where those in the box or out of the mail?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2565.914,2567.89,They were out in the mails.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.949,2594.767,But Mr. McGovern --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2594.767,2595.071,Mr. Justice --
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2595.071,2598.453,-- you say didn't know the actual condition of the company at the time --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2598.453,2599.397,We did not know.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.397,2600.993,-- you contracted by --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2600.993,2601.647,That's right.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.647,2608.066,When did you sign the -- were you ever obligated to buy before the closing day?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2608.066,2615.353,"Yes, we are obligated to buy at whatever time Mr. Mosman would finally convene his stockholders and got their approval to go ahead for the sale."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2615.353,2617.902,He just didn't give you an option.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2617.902,2621.19,"Well, we have an option to begin what the option was exercised."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.19,2627.292,"And what was a period of time that's been exercising, between the time you were bound and time you closed?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2627.292,2636.642,"The record shows Mr. Justice White, I would say between about some time around July 20th and the actual closing was on September 10th."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.185,2641.26,You didn't arrange for a -- for audits prior to closing.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2641.26,2642.617,We didn't arrange for more audits.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2647.106,2650.274,But you didn't know the addition of company prior to closing --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2650.274,2650.301,We did --
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2650.301,2654.858,"You thought, it was a -- you thought it was a company in reasonably good shape?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2654.858,2657.095,"No, we didn't think the company was in reasonably good shape."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.548,2675.371,Did you realize at the time of closing and it was in a -- that it was insolvent in the sense that you speak out?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2675.371,2675.474,No.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.474,2677.147,-- that he's unable to pay his debts?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2677.147,2679.854,No we did not.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2685.977,2689.29,But you thought there was a lot better shape in -- then it really was?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2689.29,2691.187,We certainly did Mr. Justice White.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2702.324,2702.669,Would you say --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2702.669,2706.825,"But this thing is so extraordinary, I don't think that any rational person ever could've conceived of it."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.825,2719.242,"Well, do you -- do you say that as a matter fact, this company was insolvent in the bankruptcies that his assets exceeded his -- or his liability exceeded in his assets?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2719.242,2719.497,No.
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.83,2726.931,What --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2726.931,2740.924,"If you take all this floating checks outstanding, if you take his demand notes to the bank, you see, he had borrowed the limit -- the legal limit of his local bank to lend him money and demand notes by the tune of about $300,000 just prior to the closing."
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.929,2766.903,"What is meant by tangible net worth in those findings, could tell us?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2766.903,2768.904,Tangible net worth?
1961.286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2804.319,2810.724,"Mr. McGovern, isn't this the normal situation for someone to seek chapter 10 rather than straight bankruptcy?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2810.724,2813.293,"Yes, I would say so."
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2829.903,2847.159,"Well, Mr. McGovern, I'm just wondering if so far as the status of the company is concerned that there'd be any great difference between this little black box situation and just as delaying granting checks for two or three months?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2847.159,2849.375,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it'd be the slightest (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2849.375,2851.226,Could be always (Voice Overlap) --
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2851.226,2855.715,"The only significance for us Mr. Chief Justice is by virtual of doing the way he did, we are now --"
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2855.715,2855.869,Yes.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2855.869,2857.608,"-- able to reconstruct the record, because we see the --"
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2857.608,2857.777,Yes.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2857.777,2858.477,-- dates.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2858.477,2859.23,Yes.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2878.275,2879.397,Mr. Chief Justice if we have (Voice Overlap) --
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.397,2881.818,"In times of depression, in times of depression --"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2881.818,2881.844,Yes.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2881.844,2883.139,-- particularly.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,2883.139,2888.018,"Mr. Chief Justice, we have nothing more in this record than simply late payment of bills."
1961.286,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3050.652,3060.119,Is there any a suggestion that to the condition of this company is the result of dishonesty in the part of (Inaudible)
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3060.119,3066.348,None of to all as far we are concerned Mr. Justice Harlan.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3167.576,3190.93,"Mr. Friedman suggested that as a possibility, he may have had financial credit that would have unable him to carry over but then he did this in order to keep his company without any long time indebtedness, is there any -- what is your --"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3190.93,3190.962,Well --
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3190.962,3192.69,-- response to that?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3192.69,3202.668,I say that I cannot believe Mr. Chief Justice that a man with credit at the bank would write a payroll check and not have funds in the bank to cover it.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3227.03,3231.855,Is there any finding that of the court on that issue?
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3231.855,3233.124,On this last point about --
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3233.124,3233.504,Yes.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3233.504,3233.966,-- yes.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3257.666,3258.707,Yes.
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3258.707,3264.494,-- that check we now know was withheld in the little black box for about 90 days.
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3578.887,3590.227,"Mr. McGovern, would you mind stating your opinion as to -- as of what date we should judge the failing condition of the company?"
1961.286,1,45412,william_l_mcgovern,,3590.227,3601.922,"I would say Mr. Chief Justice in response to your question, the question of Mr. Justice Harlan that of course the appropriate date is the date of the actual sale, September 10th 1959."
1961.286,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3651.52,3652.963,Mr. Friedman.
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3652.963,3656.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.286,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3730.419,3738.481,Mr. Friedman your basic deposition here is that there was error on the part of the District Court to grant a summary judgment in this case?
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3738.481,3739.182,That's right.
1961.286,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3739.182,3747.285,"Now, I ask you -- let me say it that we seem to have here a record of some 638 pages."
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3754.232,3766.322,"Well, I think Mr. Justice is this, that most of the pre-trial, the depositions that were refer to, were taken before the motion for summary judgment was made."
1961.286,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3785.418,3787.185,So why make any difference?
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3787.185,3787.615,Pardon?
1961.286,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3787.615,3789.161,Does the motivation make any difference?
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3789.161,3794.908,"Well, I -- I think the motivation maybe significant in the determining the basic situation."
1961.286,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3814.958,3815.699,-- (Voice Overlap) --
1961.286,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3815.699,3820.02,-- the company -- it's pointed out that the company was up to its legal limit with its bank.
