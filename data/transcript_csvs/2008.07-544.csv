2008.07-544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.248,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,7.402,22.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and the one in Stromberg were structural defects."
2008.07-544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.456,97.44,"Do that again, will you?"
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,97.44,107.388,We need to have a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.094,144.734,Can I interrupt you?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,157.73,158.12,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.856,192.792,But you said that's what happened here.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,194.355,194.964,--Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,205.086,206.911,"But you should have said ""no"" to the question, I think."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,218.735,222.232,There is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.
2008.07-544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,224.139,224.544,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,224.544,244.85,"Then the harmless error question is: Given that they misapplied the law, do we know under the requisite degree of certainty -- Chapman on direct review, Brecht here -- that they would still have found him guilty of felony murder under a proper instruction?"
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,244.85,250.083,Do you agree that the California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation to the answer to that question?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,260.951,273.792,"I'm not sure I followed the last part of the question, but I agree with you if what you are saying is that the California Supreme Court, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,276.994,277.29,No.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,282.523,288.146,"Their basis for the conclusion was the jury's ""special circumstance"" finding."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.146,288.551,Right.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,288.551,300.578,"Now, they did not consider, when they made that ""special"" -- when they interpreted that ""special circumstance"", the ""and/or"" mistake that was embedded in the instructions."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.578,304.559,Which meant that the jury really hadn't answered the question they thought it had answered.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,304.559,305.592,"No, it didn't mean that."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.144,334.64,"If you do that, you are removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's decision."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,334.64,336.36,--Well--
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.36,337.702,Is that not right?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,337.702,340.762,--The basis--
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.762,341.53,At least the basis--
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,341.53,343.324,--The basis for the California Supreme Court--
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.324,346.463,--The basis--
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,346.463,347.387,--I think -- I think that--
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.387,349.196,--for the decision was a -- was a specific finding--
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,349.196,352.04,"--The reasoning behind the decision, yes, I think that's right."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.04,352.461,--All right.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,352.461,353.088,Okay.
2008.07-544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.916,365.208,Could you clarify the -- the category of cases that would be affected if your argument is accepted?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,375.188,376.127,True.
2008.07-544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.127,381.7,"Now, what is the standard under California law for submitting a theory of liability to the jury?"
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,385.294,388.371,I'm not sure I understand the question.
2008.07-544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,394.805,408.361,"Well, you are -- you are arguing that there are instances in which, when a theory of liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and it's erroneous -- the error can be harmless."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,408.361,408.926,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,408.926,409.659,Correct?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,422.761,429.07,I don't think -- I don't think I know the answer to that question.
2008.07-544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,455.954,468.666,What I'm asking is: When is there going to be a case in which a theory of liability is submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous -- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,476.285,491.44,"--This one -- this case -- this case was submitted to the jury on two alternative theories: One of them correct, pre-killing aiding and abetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and abetting."
2008.07-544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.742,528.157,"I thought there was -- that there was this -- there were three possibilities, and one was that the defendant didn't do anything before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an accessory after the fact."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,535.749,538.733,"Well, the jury rejected accessory after the fact but--"
2008.07-544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.733,539.825,How do we know that?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,541.762,551.569,--They were instructed on accessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they found in essence robbery and felony murder.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.569,557.02,"They found the greater offense, so there would have been no need for them to go to the lesser included offense."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,573.937,574.468,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,575.185,577.935,"I mean, that's the difficulty we are having."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,577.935,578.98,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.352,589.913,Right.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,589.913,600.582,"However, they went and found the special circumstance in which they found reckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant."
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,600.582,623.524,"I thought the, the difficulty with using that as a means of answering the first error was that the way the special circumstance instruction was phrased, they could have found the special circumstance without finding anything more than that he came in at a late stage."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,623.524,623.945,No.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,638.486,639.83,The second -- go ahead.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,639.83,660.402,"--It didn't address the reckless indifference to human life and the major participant, but that was embedded in the instructions, and from the start the courts that have looked at this and have reached this question have all agreed that there was a jury finding of reckless indifference to human life and major participant, and they have disagreed as to what it might have meant."
2008.07-544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.527,666.819,How do we -- in this -- how do we know what the jury found?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,669.475,670.988,--No.
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.203,689.78,"Isn't the special circumstance finding the one that had the word ""or"" in it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a postkilling interpretation of the event."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,689.78,691.73,--No.
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.106,695.138,I thought that was what the California Supreme Court relied on?
2008.07-544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.138,698.137,I agree with Justice Stevens.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,704.32,717.798,--The -- I'll read from JA 14.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.66,790.188,"Yes, but isn't -- maybe I'm not getting it."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,817.289,817.679,No.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,822.881,823.941,I may be doing that.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,823.941,830.486,The felony murder instructions did not speak to this question of contemporaneity.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.871,847.199,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,847.199,853.165,"And now it has to decide, among other things, as I -- as I read to you,"
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.191,871.453,Where does it say that he must have assisted prior to--
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,871.453,871.906,--It doesn't.
2008.07-544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.97,874.374,--Then that doesn't cure the error.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,874.374,898.722,"Yes, it does, and the reason that it does is because the harmless error test is not whether the jury actually made the finding that it needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do we know from the evidence and from the findings that the jury would have made the findings that it was required to make had it been properly instructed?"
2008.07-544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.722,909.86,"It seems to me that you're arguing one of two things: First, that there was no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if there was error, it was harmless error."
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,923.013,924.557,Yes.
2008.07-544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.92,953.998,The district court didn't say that.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,953.998,955.059,"No, it did not."
2008.07-544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,961.435,965.994,"So if we were to say, Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court was right--"
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,965.994,970.494,"Well, the district court was right to the extent that it found it to be trial error."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.638,1004.229,But do you not agree that the harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the California Supreme Court was incorrect?
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,1004.229,1012.554,--Was the rationale incorrect?
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.459,1015.646,In the harmless error analysis.
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,1021.128,1025.126,"--It's incorrect in the way that you're thinking it is incorrect, but it was also incorrect in another way."
2008.07-544,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.697,1039.117,"--The -- answer was incorrect, too, wasn't it?"
2008.07-544,0,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,1040.587,1048.549,"--That answer was incorrect; and as well as what you're thinking, it was incorrect, in that they premised it on a factual basis that was not in fact the case."
2008.07-544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1050.659,1051.564,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1631.39,1648.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this morning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error under the reasonable likelihood standard, the same question that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1667.609,1669.437,I agree with that.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1679.868,1680.446,Yes.
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.744,1682.197,--Right.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1685.508,1750.168,"Your Honor, although the Ninth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect nomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that the Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth Circuit decision and the district court decision, this Court can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth Circuit did conduct was actually a case-specific inquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and when an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and the instructions and anything else indicative of the jury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether the jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory, that's a substantial and injurious influence."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.135,1760.506,You're saying that I should have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1768.614,1769.129,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.129,1769.534,There it is.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1784.169,1785.292,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.292,1785.873,And that's wrong.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1831.836,1845.41,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that question is in the underlying trial reporter's transcript at pages 1015 to 1016, the district attorney's cross-examination of Mr. Pulido."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1911.04,1913.96,So the error wasn't harmless.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1917.193,1934.339,"--That certainly is an argument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced that the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance -- because I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature was inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going to defend that."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1948.459,1949.851,"Well, why don't we just take them at their word?"
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,1961.768,1973.03,"Your Honor, I think I could best answer that by offering my own critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it may be unnecessary."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2165.748,2171.105,"Under Brecht, you have the burden of showing a substantial injurious effect."
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2171.105,2198.437,"Well, actually, Your Honor, as understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced describing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are not going to use the ""burden"" terminology, and rather than talk about allocating burdens, we are going to address it from the perspective of the judge and say, if the judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2238.719,2240.56,So you think you win under Brecht?
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2240.56,2242.497,"--I think we will under Brecht, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.497,2248.09,"You think the Ninth Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually applied the Brecht standard?"
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2248.09,2256.93,"In substance, it did even though, as I said, I will -- I can't -- I can't run from the language the Ninth Circuit actually used."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.93,2257.273,Sure.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2263.301,2264.159,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2264.159,2268.437,And all the fight is over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard or not?
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2268.437,2270.89,"Yes, Your Honor, whether it applied it in substance."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2270.89,2273.031,Why don't we just send it back and ask them?
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2277.968,2301.408,"Your Honor, as I said a little earlier, if I fail to persuade the Court that the substance of what the Ninth Circuit did was -- effectively satisfied Brecht as interpreted in O'Neal, then I agree that's an appropriate course, and we indicated that in the final section of our brief."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.285,2306.797,"I'm sure that would be -- I mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among judges."
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2315.887,2316.452,"--I agree, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2316.452,2317.341,Just go do it.
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2323.776,2344.048,"Your Honor -- and, again, I don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains, remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be the Court's inclination."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.911,2681.74,"Thank you, Mr. O'Connell."
2008.07-544,2,32251,j_bradley_oconnell,,2681.74,2682.769,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.769,2688.111,"Mr. Friedlander, you have three minutes remaining."
2008.07-544,3,30243,jeremy_friedlander,,2688.111,2691.672,We agree that we need to do Brecht.
2008.07-544,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.724,2791.849,"Thank you, Mr. Friedlander."
