1992.91-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.605,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-871, Bath Iron Works v. the Director of the OWCP."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,63.334,105.613,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.014,400.635,"Now, in this case, do you concede that the hearing loss actually occurred during a time he was employed actively?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,400.635,402.963,I think it depends on which hearing loss you're referring to.
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.859,429.795,But some basic loss--
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,429.795,430.42,Some of it--
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.42,430.811,--Occurred--
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,430.811,431.53,--Yes.
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.654,434.091,--Earlier.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,434.091,444.555,"--That distinction, that hearing loss due to excessive noise in an occupational setting occurs shortly after the injurious stimulus occurs."
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.555,446.617,Do you disagree with that as a--
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,446.617,446.945,No.
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.928,449.662,--Medical proposition?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,449.662,458.237,"--That basic theory, but I just feel it doesn't go far enough because it doesn't concentrate on the disease that becomes... or the disability that becomes manifest later to the worker."
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.237,466.078,"Yes, but we have no question before us here as to the extent to which that greater disability may even be compensable."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,481.681,486.695,"The hearing loss wasn't manifest during the period of employment, the hearing loss wasn't manifest--"
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,486.695,497.251,"Well, the fact that he had an 84 percent hearing loss at some later time presumably was not manifest earlier, but that's not the issue that we're dealing with."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,497.251,500.501,--We're dealing with the issue of whether--
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.501,505.233,We don't even know whether he's entitled to compensation or an 84 percent hearing loss.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,506.404,507.232,--That's not the issue.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.777,518.869,You would concede that he is entitled to compensation for 84 percent?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,518.869,521.179,"--And the question is, under which provision of the law--"
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.179,524.617,"I mean, that's a generous concession for you to make, but--"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,524.617,527.803,--I guess I may be misleading in that way.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,542.437,562.164,--And whether it should or should not be depends upon which the hearing loss... depends upon whether the hearing loss attributable to the occupational conditions... the injury attributable to the occupational conditions occurred during the period of employment and whether that loss was manifest or should have been manifest during the period of employment.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,564.225,575.409,I guess I would change that a little to say that it depends on whether the disability that became manifest to the worker became manifest before or after the retirement.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,575.409,577.939,"Well, except that that, as I understand it, is not the standard."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,617.283,625.482,I think that the provision under which he's compensated does depend on when the hearing becomes manifest in terms of when it's measured.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,626.076,629.575,"No, but I... excuse me, I'm not making my question clear."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,646.614,657.799,"--I think that the time when the injury occurred, what we're referring to is the time of injury under section 910(i), and I think that depends on when the worker knows or should have known--"
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.799,658.454,Should have known.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,658.454,659.829,--Of a disability.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.829,660.297,Okay.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,660.297,670.027,"And my point would be that in the case of hearing loss, a worker cannot know of a disability, which is an impairment measured by a hearing test, until the hearing test is taken."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.027,672.885,But that's not how 10(i) reads.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,703.326,718.665,"I think that the question is what disability is Congress referring to when they refer to, does not immediately result in death or disability, and our position is that the disability that's important is the disability that becomes manifest in the disability which the worker can claim."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.098,734.563,But that's all the section talks about... disability due to an occupational disease which does not immediately result in death or disability.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,734.563,743.513,"But I think that the first and the third references to disability in the statute refer to something else, and that the disability should be read consistently."
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.402,756.024,I have a problem that's a slightly... it's a threshold problem on this same section while you're on it.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,761.989,762.942,--Well--
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,762.942,764.113,Why isn't it an injury?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,764.113,785.855,"--Because the distinction between an injury and an occupational disease is that an injury happens because of a sudden event, where an occupational disease occurs over a long period of time, evolves over a period of time, and occurs not because of an accident or a sudden event, but because of the characteristics of the particular industry."
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,785.855,793.727,Are you saying that a hearing loss is an occupational disease as opposed to an accidental injury?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,793.727,794.774,Yes.
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,799.584,807.535,"Well, doesn't the act in 902 define accidental injury and occupational disease as two different things?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,818.343,820.668,Right.
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.257,841.411,But there's still a difference between an occupational disease on the one hand and an injury on the other--
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,841.411,842.552,--That's correct.
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,842.552,849.829,"--And it seems to me that all that this statute does is to talk about occupational injuries, so that you're not within it anyway."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,849.829,853.594,"When you say this statute, you refer--"
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.594,854.828,910(i).
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,854.828,861.592,--I think it's been held repeatedly that hearing loss is an occupational disease by the various circuit courts.
1992.91-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.592,864.386,And they have addressed this subject specifically.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,864.386,865.104,Yes.
1992.91-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.104,869.697,"And the Director doesn't claim otherwise, does he?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,869.697,870.478,That's correct.
1992.91-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.478,879.349,"And by the way, your position is at odds with the Director's position."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,879.349,879.88,Correct.
1992.91-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.88,886.971,Do you think that your interpretation of the statute is the only permissible one?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,886.971,889.236,"I think it's the only plausible one, yes."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.332,928.58,Can you tell me again why you say that the time of injury is after retirement?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,931.016,936.78,"Because it is the date of manifestation... that is, the date when the worker knows he has a disability."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.415,954.523,--But then 10(i) becomes circular.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,999.348,1010.937,"But without 10(i), the time of injury for average weekly wage purposes would be the date of last exposure, and the legislative history makes it clear that Congress did not want that result at all."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.727,1068.899,"Let me put it... it seems to me that you're saying 10(i) applies here because this is an injury that occurred after retirement, and then I ask you why this is an injury that recurs after retirement, and you say, because 10(i) says that it shall be deemed to be an injury that recurs after retirement, but you don't get into 10(i) to begin with unless it is an injury that occurs after retirement, so you can't appeal to 10(i) as the justification for your assertion that this injury occurred after retirement."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1068.899,1071.351,10(i) doesn't deal with retirement at all.
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.174,1106.087,"No, but it... 10(i) deals with retirement inasmuch as you only qualify for 10(i) if the injury does not occur immediately... that is, while you're still working, okay... and I ask you why this injury didn't occur immediately, and you say, well, because 10(i) says it shall be deemed not to have occurred until you find out about it, but you don't get into 10(i) unless it did not occur immediately."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1106.087,1112.491,"In the case of any occupational disease, the disability can occur while the worker is still working."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.799,1123.002,Yes.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1123.002,1125.204,"--Retirement, you're in 10(d)(2)."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.204,1143.118,"That is because asbestosis is not a disease which immediately results in disability, but I thought that it had been conceded here that the hearing disability occurs immediately."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1143.118,1161.252,"Again, we have to refine that to mean... to determine whether we're talking about a disability that the worker can claim, and the disability that later becomes manifest on the one hand, or just the occupational component of the disease, which may not be manifest to the worker."
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.257,1200.237,"But you do concede that in medical terms anyway the hearing loss, the compensable hearing loss that we're talking about, occurred before retirement."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1209.655,1210.575,--The--
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1210.575,1212.294,The damage to the ear--
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1212.294,1217.495,"--Caused by the employment, but not the compensable hearing loss which you made reference to."
1992.91-871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1223.367,1223.727,--Okay.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1245.437,1245.999,Yes.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1247.67,1273.034,"Well, you don't deny, do you, that if following the date of his first exposure to noise he said I wonder if I had a hearing loss, and he went to... what is it, an audiologist, and had his hearing measured, and the finding was that he had suffered a 5 percent hearing loss and he could show that that was attributable to the noise, you don't deny that that would have been compensable right then and there, do you?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1273.034,1274.315,"That would be compensable, yes."
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.315,1274.986,Okay.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1274.986,1276.08,I agree with that.
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.62,1302.429,"Well, except that there... Redick is... or the desire to respond to Redick is satisfied simply by extending the date within which claim may be made, isn't that true?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1302.429,1315.065,"I don't believe so, because Redick... the claimant in Redick was not denied benefits because he had filed his claim late under section 913 or because he gave notice late under section 912."
1992.91-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.577,1348.831,"But without an extension of the time within which claim would have been made, he would have been out anyway, wouldn't he, so Congress could have said this will satisfy the problem of allowing Redick... allowing Redicks of this world to come in and make their claim, and because we assume that the injury is complete at the date at which it occurs, there will be no problem for them."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1348.831,1358.703,--It's not clear whether Mr. Redick would or would not have had a problem with notice in the statute of limitations if he would had gotten over the retiree provisions.
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.82,1379.194,May I just ask you a question?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1387.206,1387.362,Right.
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.362,1387.753,--Right.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1398.187,1400.967,"No, I don't believe so, because his--"
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.967,1401.81,Then why are they different?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1401.81,1403.263,--Condition arose before retirement.
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.263,1413.055,"Well, but why is that... why is the hearing loss claim different if it arose before retirement, if he in fact... you know, the noise around the place caused him to lose some hearing?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1413.055,1416.898,"I guess the question that you're asking is, was Redick wrongly decided?"
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.898,1418.663,"Yeah, I think Redick may well have been wrongly decided."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1418.663,1429.174,"It very well may have been, and I think the important point is not whether it was or it was not, or whether it was fair or unfair, but the question is, what did Congress intend to do in light of Aduddell and Redick?"
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.174,1450.697,"Well, of course, they did at least take care of the cases like asbestosis, or however you pronounce it, where the injury does not really manifest itself until 2 or 3 years later, and they may have thought hearing loss was the same, but maybe they're wrong about hearing loss, and maybe hearing loss does... you know, is an injury before retirement and therefore should be treated like a loss of leg."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1450.697,1459.567,"And the real question is whether Congress thought that hearing loss was different... not whether it is or it isn't, but what Congress intended."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.567,1461.067,"Well, is that the case?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1488.29,1488.744,I think the--
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.744,1489.947,I don't think we do that.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1489.947,1495.1,--I think the congressional intent has to be followed unless there's some constitutional problem with it.
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.585,1498.239,Even if it's contrary to the language of the statute?
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1498.239,1503.174,"--Well, what we're trying to determine is what Congress intended with the language of the statute."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.174,1514.436,"Oh, but that's quite different what you said... I thought you were saying even if Congress put it incorrectly we're bound to follow... to do what Congress thought it was doing even if it ended up doing something else."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1516.389,1532.366,"The point I'm trying to make is that Congress did not intend to draw a distinction between hearing loss and other occupational diseases along the lines that the Director suggested, and the reason I say that is that first Congress intended to do something about Redick."
1992.91-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.873,1577.316,"Well, just as a practical matter, you know, if I'm exposed to something that causes me to lose my hearing and I find I used to be able to hear Justice Blackmun quite well when he whispered to me, but now I can't hear him at all, I don't need a hearing test to tell me that I've lost my hearing, do I?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1577.316,1586.845,"Well, you may feel subjectively that you've lost your hearing, but you may not have what a hearing test would show is an AMA percentage of hearing impairment."
1992.91-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.845,1595.966,"Well, so you say the only way that something... a disease or injury can manifest itself is if there's some medical test that is performed to show it?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1595.966,1597.325,"In the case of hearing loss, I would."
1992.91-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.325,1598.965,"Well, what if I break my arm."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1605.899,1625.969,"I agree with that, but... and you would know your disability if you couldn't work, but here we're dealing with injuries as opposed to an occupational disease that evolves over time, and again I think that the date of manifestation and hearing loss is when the hearing is tested and an AMA disability can be determined."
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.969,1630.342,"Mr. Gillis, can I follow up on a question that Justice O'Connor asked you?"
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1654.911,1657.081,The occupational component of it doesn't.
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.081,1662.094,Well... which is to say you may have hearing loss from some other causes as well.
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1662.094,1664.733,"That can continue after, for example, a retirement."
1992.91-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.733,1664.983,"Oh, sure."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1665.343,1665.718,Particularly aging.
1992.91-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.718,1678.902,"--Somebody else can shoot a gun in your ear or something like that, and you'd lose your hearing, but the effect of the occupational activities that caused your hearing loss does not increase afterwards."
1992.91-871,0,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,1680.213,1681.385,"I agree with that statement, yes."
1992.91-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.54,1687.351,"Very well, Mr. Gillis."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1689.615,1695.987,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the members of the Court:"
1992.91-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.176,1776.378,I didn't understand the waiver to be quite as broad as you say.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1795.572,1796.681,"That is correct, you will get a--"
1992.91-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1796.681,1797.056,--And that's not waived.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1797.056,1798.54,--You will get a very different answer.
1992.91-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.54,1798.759,Yes.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1798.759,1806.444,But the specific issue of whether the case should be sent back for a recalculation of this individual's award has been held to have been waived by the First Circuit.
1992.91-871,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.444,1810.035,"Under that section, under 13, not under 23."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1815.97,1816.752,That's correct.
1992.91-871,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.752,1818.187,"What are you here for, then?"
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1818.187,1818.499,Because--
1992.91-871,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.499,1819.078,I don't understand.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1819.078,1819.374,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.512,1833.228,Do we have a case of controversy before us if it's a matter of indifference to your client?
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1833.228,1836.914,If the Court accepts that argument... the waiver argument.
1992.91-871,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1932.533,1936.812,"Well, that's not true if it's a scheduled... if it's scheduled, isn't it?"
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,1936.812,1953.289,"That's correct, Your Honor, but for the purposes of section 10(i), which doesn't refer to scheduled awards, it simply says in the case of an injury which does not immediately result in disability, then you have to go and read the section which defines disability, section 210."
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.249,2495.415,"Well, I take it that in subdivision 13 dealing with hearing that it's a permanent partial disability, isn't it?"
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2495.415,2496.508,"It is, Your Honor, yes."
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.508,2505.818,"So it is a disability, even though it doesn't result in any proved loss of earnings."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2505.818,2507.146,"It can, obviously."
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.207,2512.846,"Well, I know, but you don't have to prove it to get this compensation under 13."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2512.846,2513.299,--That's correct.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.299,2516.205,You say it's just because it's presumed.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2516.205,2516.718,It is presumed.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.882,2555.86,"Well, whether it's presumed or not, if you get a toe cut off, whether you just go right on doing your job and everybody agrees that you're just as good as you ever were, you're earning just as much and you get salary increases or wage increases, you just don't have to prove that there's any loss--"
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2555.86,2556.735,--That's correct.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.735,2559.374,--And the statute doesn't provide for there being any loss.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2559.374,2561.794,The statute awards you benefits--
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.794,2562.388,Yes.
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2562.388,2563.605,--For that loss.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.793,2565.059,"Yes, yes."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2565.059,2565.809,You don't have to prove it.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.809,2573.102,It's not too bad an idea to give somebody some money for getting a toe cut off--
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2573.102,2574.712,"I agree, and that's why I say--"
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.712,2579.459,"--And there's nothing wrong with saying you've lost some hearing on the job, we're going to pay you for it."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2579.459,2580.147,--Absolutely.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.201,2605.088,"Well, suppose the day before he retired he had an audiogram and said I've lost hearing."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2605.088,2605.901,--Fine.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.901,2611.367,"Well, he's only going to get what 13 says he gets."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2611.367,2612.586,That's correct.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.586,2614.82,But a day after he retires--
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2614.82,2621.911,"Under either of the other two theories he will receive less, especially under the theory advocated by the employer--"
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.911,2623.645,--Well--
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2623.645,2630.408,--Because he will receive a small amount of money weekly for the balance of his life as opposed to the award under section 13.
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.408,2637.141,"--Well, I know, but why should it be different the day after he retires than the day he retires?"
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2637.141,2638.781,"I don't believe it should, Your Honor, and that's my point."
1992.91-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.781,2639.655,"Well, it isn't."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2649.995,2653.275,"And that's... that is... if I can use your term, that is the scheme they adopted."
1992.91-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2660.068,2661.552,"Thank you, Mr. Lupton."
1992.91-871,1,39750,ronald_w_lupton,,2661.552,2661.959,Thank you.
1992.91-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.959,2663.629,"Mr. Wright, we'll hear from you."
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2663.629,2676.453,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-871,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.176,2783.503,"Well, you agree, I take it... or do you +/?"
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2786.393,2799.777,"We have not challenged that, Justice Kennedy, and I should admit that the medical treatise on which we rely refers to occupational hearing loss as a disease."
1992.91-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.182,2845.994,"Well, it's... yes."
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2859.489,2874.982,"Well, our answer to that is, this Court noted in Pepco and has long been the rule, and I do not believe is challenged by any party to this case, is that scheduled injuries automatically call for recovery."
1992.91-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.887,2879.168,And loss of earnings is assumed.
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2879.168,2880.542,The loss of earning is presumed.
1992.91-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.542,2882.074,Which means that it's a disability.
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2882.074,2883.51,That's right.
1992.91-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.51,2901.674,"So the definition of disability really is not... I guess it isn't... 8(c)(13) doesn't seem to use disability in the definitional sense either, because it says in the case of disability partial in character but permanent in quality."
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2908.688,2911.78,They're talking about a loss of hearing which occurs immediately.
1992.91-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.402,2919.73,--Well--
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2919.73,2922.166,--Are presumptive of disability.
1992.91-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.166,2930.975,--Section... subsection (c) describes... is dealing with what itself calls permanent partial disability.
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2930.975,2933.255,It says that hearing loss is permanent partial disability.
1992.91-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.255,2934.786,"Yes, so they're all disabilities."
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2934.786,2937.598,I agree that that's right.
1992.91-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.375,2954.621,"Whatever, but I would think (c) at least says that all of these listed items are disabilities."
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2954.621,2959.854,"--If you've suffered a loss of hearing, you've suffered a disability whether or not your earning capacity has gone down."
1992.91-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.533,3215.033,Could I ask you a question about that right at that point?
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3242.553,3255.281,"In our view... and this gets a little complicated, but in the case you described I believe the entire hearing loss would probably be compensated."
1992.91-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.873,3262.107,Right.
1992.91-871,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3262.107,3275.242,"--For the employer to be liable, and it's then not possible to separate out the age-related hearing loss from the occupational hearing loss, then an award for the entire hearing loss is what is normally proper."
1992.91-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.207,3407.426,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1992.91-871,3,33841,kevin_m_gillis,,3410.127,3420.81,I wanted to cover the reasons why in my view the Director's interpretation of the statute is implausible.
1992.91-871,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3605.219,3606.735,"Thank you, Mr. Gillis."
