1987.86-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,57.821,"Mr. Rubin, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,57.821,63.148,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.027,213.946,"Mr. Rubin, were these other children... were they handicapped also, or were they non-handicapped?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,213.946,215.179,"--They were handicapped children, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.536,234.032,"Mr. Rubin, both of the students involved in this case have now left the public schools system, is that correct?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,234.032,237.405,I have a feeling I am going to hear about mootness here.
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.811,243.246,"Well, I am just asking the present status of these students."
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,243.246,248.494,"--Your Honor, the first student, John Doe, is over the age of 21."
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.815,286.245,"May I ask, as long as you are interrupted, whether you raised the first question in your Cert Petition, the so-called ""dangerousness exception"" to the statute in the courts below?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,286.245,289.916,"Your Honor, we believe we did."
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.491,306.566,"Well, can you refer me to anything specific so that I might satisfy myself that you indeed raised it below?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,306.566,312.718,"Your Honor, in terms... I personally did not raise it."
1987.86-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.982,369.602,"Mr. Rubin, could you elaborate on your statement that the 20 year old conceivably could come back into the San... I mean, anybody in the country could conceivably could go to the San Francisco school district."
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,369.602,391.546,"With respect to possible mootness, Your Honor, we think that this is capable of repetition yet evading review, although within the Murphy v. Hunt requirement that there be a ""reasonable expectation"", in that it will recur between these parties--"
1987.86-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.546,392.655,Between these parties?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,392.655,395.169,--I can make no representation.
1987.86-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.079,466.469,How old was he at the time?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,466.469,469.984,"--Your Honor, at the time of the incident, he was--"
1987.86-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.984,470.342,John Doe?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,470.342,476.778,"--John Doe was, 17 years old, he was 6 feet tall and he weighed 195 pounds."
1987.86-728,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,476.778,477.403,And the other one?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,477.403,479.292,The other one was 13 years old.
1987.86-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,529.615,537.191,"Before you get into that, just to refresh my recollection, before the lawsuit was filed, what was the posture of the matter?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,564.726,567.554,"It was filed before it could be done, before a hearing could be--"
1987.86-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.554,570.707,Was it while the five... before the five-day suspension had expired?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,570.707,573.3,"--No, it was after that five-day suspension had--"
1987.86-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.3,577.408,"So by the time the lawsuit had been filed, he had been suspended indefinitely?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,577.408,579.954,--On an extended suspension.
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.943,609.942,Was this ever referred to the juvenile court?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,609.942,611.02,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,611.02,614.285,Was this ever referred to the juvenile court?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,614.285,616.33,"No, Your Honor, not to my knowledge."
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,616.33,618.282,Is there any reason why not?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,618.282,620.938,I do not know why it was not.
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.938,624.842,"Well, is kicking out a window a crime in California?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,624.842,630.621,"Your Honor, I believe initially they try to handle these things administratively."
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.245,641.195,"Well, if you kick one out would get into trouble... you would have trouble, would you not?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,641.195,644.835,"Well, hopefully, Your Honor, it would not be a manifestation of my handicap."
1987.86-728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,649.442,656.782,"The fact that he is handicapped does not immune him from criminal prosecution, does it not?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,656.782,673.355,"--Well, no, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, this is not in the Record, but later on in 1982, I believe it was, John Doe was involved in the criminal justice system and did go on to the state hospital."
1987.86-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.074,757.273,"Mr. Rubin, with reference to that statement, is a ""suspension"" a ""change in educational placement""?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,765.473,777.436,--The consensus seems to be that 10 days... the 9th Circuit said 20 days here... a suspension would in effect become a change in placement.
1987.86-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.436,778.796,What do you think?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,780.171,797.758,"Well, a short suspension, during which you are trying to figure out what to do with the child, certainly would not be a change in placement, whether it is ten days or twenty days, I would have to say 20 days, I think, which the Ninth Circuit allowed us--"
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,797.758,802.646,"Mr. Rubin, I thought the Ninth Circuit referred to 30 days, not 20 days?"
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,802.646,808.784,"--Well, 30 is in a special case, Your Honor when it involves a transfer from one school from another."
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.784,813.765,Is there not some federal guideline that suggests 10 days is the limit?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,813.765,816.311,"There is, I believe, and--"
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,816.311,825.37,So that would be the administrative agency interpretation placed on it by the federal agency?
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,825.37,825.558,--Yes.
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.365,893.171,"Well, there is a problem with the ""stay-put provision"", which does appear to indicate that Congress thought that a child should stay put, pending following the procedural provisions in the statute."
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,907.931,917.239,"Your Honor, first, I think we can look at this as not really... an exception to the statute."
1987.86-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.176,970.422,"Call it what you will, you want us to read something into the statute that is not expressly there, and that would appear at least on the face of it to read in an exception that would be at tension with the statute."
1987.86-728,0,16803,asher_rubin,,979.574,1012.577,"Your Honor, I believe the Solicitor-General's approach, which I hesitate to characterize for him, is an alternative which... has some merit to it, that is, you can give the district court the ability to weigh these matters as ordinary injunctive matters and balance equities and irreparable injury, et cetera."
1987.86-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.843,1164.811,"Thank you, Mr. Rubin."
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1166.608,1175.573,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.006,1382.722,"Mr. Nager, do you have a position on what the appropriate relief in this case would have been?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1382.722,1388.032,"I can give a series of possibilities, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.007,1415.881,Is it something that the district court should have ordered?
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1415.881,1416.537,--Yes.
1987.86-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.371,1442.917,"Do you think there was a violation of the ""stay-put"" provision?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1442.917,1445.854,"--Well, our position is that there was not, because--"
1987.86-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.854,1447.54,"Well, then there should have been no relief, I guess?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1447.54,1455.475,"--That is correct, although the state... the local education agency still would have had a continuing obligation under the EHA to provide--"
1987.86-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.475,1460.191,I am focusing on what the district judge should do when they come into a court in this kind of emergency.
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1462.051,1482.572,"--Because there was a basis for claiming that the children were dangerous here, it is correct that the district court, we did not believe, should have directed the local education agency as to which alternative placement would have been most appropriate."
1987.86-728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.298,1507.656,Is there anything in the Record of expert information?
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1507.656,1510.64,"No, and that is part of our point in this case, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1514.42,1516.154,On either side?
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1516.154,1518.075,"--On either side, that is correct."
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.82,1582.767,"Is it your position then that the ""stay-put"" provision just is not violated when the school suspends a violent student?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1582.767,1586.501,"The short answer is ""yes"", Justice White."
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.032,1590.626,Whether it is for 30 days or 100 days or anything else?
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1590.626,1591.203,--No.
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.895,1628.032,"But I take it, then, that a district court in a case like this should say, ""well, the"" stay-put"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1638.044,1639.419,Yes.
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.714,1685.852,Why is this case not moot?
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1685.852,1690.554,The United States is inclined to believe that it is moot.
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.638,1715.355,"There were claims for damages, but they were rejected, I take it?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1715.355,1728.179,"Yes, the district court held that there was sovereign immunity for the state; there was a settlement with regard to the local school district with regard to damages; and the court of appeals found that there was qualified immunity for the state officials."
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.179,1734.426,"But there was a settlement on damages, but was that contingent on liability or what?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1734.426,1736.706,"Not to my knowledge, Justice White."
1987.86-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.94,1747.125,"What do you mean, if the local... if the school authorities win this case like you think they should, are they just going to pay the damages?"
1987.86-728,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1747.125,1752.185,"--I believe they have already been paid, but I am not privy to the information whether the monies have been forthcoming."
1987.86-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.937,1786.999,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1795.073,1796.589,"We did not, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.657,1864.624,"That would not ordinarily be enough, would it, to meet our standards?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1864.624,1884.77,"It may not be, given the inclination of the Court to say that, while it is technically possible for a Petitioner to come within the circumstances again, if in fact it is not likely that they will, then the case could be moot."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.812,1941.718,What about sending it back and find out what they do want?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1953.369,1955.196,Perhaps that would--
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.196,1957.071,"Would it not be moot if both of them said,"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1962.021,1979.78,"--I do not believe it would because the gravamen of the injury here, Your Honor, was in fact the absence of a state policy and a practice of the state to sanction actions like the Unified School Districts in continuing to treat handicapped children under the regular discipline code."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.78,1986.762,"Well, you do not have any person before us who wants that right enforced."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1986.762,1992.01,"Well, with due respect, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is not true."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.01,1994.946,"Well, who wants it enforced?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,1994.946,1998.961,Jack Smith is within the age when he can continue to be educated.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.428,2003.208,Has he asked to be placed in an education?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2003.208,2005.253,--He has not asked to go back to the Unified School District.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.253,2006.112,Then how is he asking?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2006.112,2009.814,He remains eligible under the federal Act.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.814,2013.095,Is anybody that is eligible old enough to bring this suit?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2013.095,2024.887,"Well, they would have been at the time it started because San Francisco or the State of California did not allow any handicapped child who was disabled--"
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.887,2035.101,"Well, at this stage, so far as I am concerned, I would be satisfied if he told you that he wanted this case decided."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2036.523,2037.912,"--Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2037.912,2038.881,He told you that?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2038.881,2039.428,Yes.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.428,2044.19,That he wanted this case in this Court decided?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2044.19,2045.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.19,2048.502,Now that you understand--
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2048.502,2053.187,--I have spoken to both of my clients within the last two weeks.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.54,2076.35,"--Well, does he not need a committee or somebody to represent him?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2084.69,2086.297,Jack Smith has not been found insane.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.297,2091.391,I am not talking about Jack Smith; I am talking about the one that is in the insane asylum.
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2091.391,2098.872,"He does not need... as a matter of fact, he does not need a guardian or a conservator, if that is what you are suggesting."
1987.86-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.433,2107.352,Is Respondent Smith living in the San Francisco school district now?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2107.352,2111.007,"He is not living in the school district, although his guardians still are."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.318,2138.996,"So, for this case to recur, we have to assume that Jack Smith is going to move back to San Francisco; that he is going to be placed by the San Francisco school district in a program that cannot handle violent children; and that this same episode will repeat itself."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2142.104,2143.01,We have to see.
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.68,2147.149,Either one.
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2147.149,2156.255,"I think it is likely that he could ask for education because he in fact has not graduated, and it is his right; he is a handicapped student and needs some training."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.255,2156.49,Fine.

1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.719,2212.139,Put them in a program that they know cannot handle them?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2213.966,2228.35,"--Well, the more difficult problem, Your Honor, is that they want to put them in a program that they unilaterally have selected, and that is the concern more than any other, we feel, that proposition violates congressional intent."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.107,2253.857,"Ms. Brogna, when you say"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2259.918,2261.556,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.556,2265.102,The San Francisco Unified Schools have never petitioned for Certiorari.
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2265.102,2266.475,"They did not, Your Honor, that is correct."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.475,2277.113,"So what then we are talking about here is really Jack Smith's possible relationship, not to the San Francisco Unified School District, but to the State of California and to the Superintendent of Education, are we not?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2277.113,2279.033,That is correct.
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.808,2302.648,"Yes, but what I am suggesting for the purposes of mootness, are the State of California is the one involved here."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2305.897,2308.068,"Well, that is correct, and I certainly point--"
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.068,2309.631,"The Chief Justice is trying to help you, Ms. Brogna, and I think--"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2312.145,2322.469,--We would point out that there are final Orders that would continue to be in effect against the School District; the injunctions do stand and have not been appealed.
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.771,2357.049,"Ms. Brogna, the State of California has conceded, however, has it not, that the procedures employed here were in some respects not correct."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2357.049,2360.672,Apparently they have.
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.672,2370.417,"So again, even if the State is the only party, do you think there is a real likelihood that the same thing would occur in another school district in California?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2370.417,2375.228,I submit I cannot predict what they would do.
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.608,2531.727,"Ms. Brogna, when you say, ""it specifically did not"", referring to Congress, are you suggesting that there is evidence that this proposal was made to Congress and Congress said, 'no, we do not want that in it?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2533.445,2576.396,"There is not a discussion about that in particular, although there are many, many references in the congressional history, Your Honor, to the fact that Congress reviewed the consent decrees in Mills and Park in quite detail, and provided all the other due process rights that had been written up and drawn together as the scheme in the Mills Court in particular, notice and opportunity for a hearing, the right to be accompanied by counsel; the right to have a transcript; the right to appeal into state or federal court... all of those due process procedures you will find in the consent decrees in Mills and Parks, and you will also find in 20 U.S.C. 1415."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.909,2624.049,"Well, Ms. Brogna, you say"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2635.076,2637.576,"No, I want to--"
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.576,2638.371,"""No"", what?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2638.371,2643.089,"--I am not saying that it was not or could not, have been dangerous, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.883,2651.272,Despite the fact that they are?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2651.272,2667.376,"Well, I think, as perhaps Justice Scalia was suggesting, if appropriate programs and appropriate planning has been made for these children, the types of outbreaks of behavior that we had in this situation should not properly occur."
1987.86-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2674.341,2685.525,"Well, Ms. Brogna, we are dealing with situations that are not always predictable and human beings do not always operate with perfection, as we know."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2711.061,2712.639,It is absolutely proper.
1987.86-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2714.278,2719.042,"Did the district court make that kind of a balancing inquiry here, do you think?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2719.042,2720.542,"Yes, she did, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.909,2784.297,Had you ever presented the court a plan that would take care of the situation?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2784.297,2787.108,"Certainly, Your Honor, and in fact you will notice at--"
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.108,2789.077,Did you... a plan?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2790.873,2804.742,"--Yes, Your Honor, at page... I believe it is in the Appendix at page 64, when the district court is talking about ""balancing the interests"", she remarked about the fact that ""plaintiff himself came forward #""--"
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.742,2808.882,I want to know what is the plan to handle a kid that has a habit of choking other people?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2808.882,2810.598,--There are many other plans.
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.333,2812.489,Like what?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2812.489,2821.798,"--He was returned to his classroom and in this case, under court Order, with an aide in the classroom and it is important to note that he finished the school year without incident."
1987.86-728,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.796,2828.139,What plan was used to prevent him from choking people?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2828.139,2834.887,--He cooperated with his psychiatrist and with the school officials.
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.021,2869.42,"Ms. Brogna, may I ask you about the government's proposal which you accepted here, do you think it is correct that the district court has discretion despite the language of the statute to use some other placement if that is more appropriate?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2888.834,2895.003,"I would say, the district court, having viewed the particular circumstances of a case before it, Your Honor."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.003,2908.185,"Right, but the next suit, in the next suit, it will have been established that the school district and its officials violated the law by taking him out of that particular placement."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2930.535,2935.721,"Prior to receiving a court Order or reaching agreement of the parents, I agree with you."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.721,2952.62,"So, in the future, although in this one case, the injunctive powers of the court would solve the problem, it will not solve the problem in the future, because we are going to be imposing civil liability on people who take the ""dangerous student"" out, if you will accept that characterization, out of this particular placement."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2952.62,2957.65,"Your Honor, with respect, I believe that Congress has already made that determination."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.321,2971.972,"I agree with you, but let us just be clear what we are saying, if we say that only the injunction... only the injunction remedy exists."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,2971.972,2981.655,"Yes, we think that the statutory scheme is set up so that, for example, when a child acts out in the classroom, the school districts may immediately suspend him."
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.267,3019.188,Is that because suspension is not a change in placement?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3019.92,3022.42,"That is correct, Your Honor, and it was never in dispute."
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.06,3027.559,Why would it... a 100-day suspension be a change?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3027.559,3039.195,"--Well, as Justice O'Connor observed, there is a regulatory ruling that suspensions of more than five... ten, days probably--"
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.195,3041.195,We are construing a statute here.
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3048.44,3058.718,--That is correct in the interpretation that comes from the comments that interpret the language of 1415 that talks about change of placement.
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.918,3070.104,How do you pick out five days or 30 or 40 or 50?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3070.104,3082.802,We pick out five days from California State provision for suspension; we pick out ten days from this Court's ruling in Goss v. Lopez and the interpretations by the United States Department of Education.
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.849,3092.704,And that is just because of the... you are just saying--
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3092.704,3094.235,--It is a juxtaposition of the state and federal--
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.235,3102.825,"--Despite the language of the statute, suspensions may be put into effect and the child excluded from school--"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3102.825,3104.091,"--Well, Your Honor, you will see that--"
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.091,3107.419,"--for a length of time without violating the ""stay-put"" position?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3107.419,3109.964,--You will see the comment at--
1987.86-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.964,3110.603,Is that not right?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3112.009,3116.726,"--There is no language in the statute that talks about suspension, you are correct."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.967,3140.936,--Who is that comment by?
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3140.936,3149.557,"It is by the... well, it was issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, prior to the change in the Administration."
1987.86-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3155.257,3188.447,"Ms. Brogna, if your position is correct on the statute and that there is no authority for the school district to make any exception for a dangerous child, other than the five-day suspension in California, will not the inevitable effect be that a school would want to place such a child in the most restrictive environment at the outset, rather than run the risk that it otherwise would, that it couldn't change the placement if the child acts out?"
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3188.447,3202.208,"Well, Justice O'Connor, we would certainly hope not, because one of the main purposes of the Education for the Handicapped Act was to mainstream these children and have them educated with non-handicapped to the maximum extent possible, so that--"
1987.86-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3202.208,3227.713,"Yes, but if you are going to be held liable... if you make a misjudgment in the placement, then it seems to me it is human nature that would cause the school to be very conservative in making the placements in the first instance, so I think the result you may get could be one you would not want."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3227.713,3228.9,--It could be.
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.979,3266.26,"Well, it is not that they cannot get them out of the program."
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3268.712,3270.978,"That is, of course, always the problem."
1987.86-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.978,3274.524,--And one would assume that the parent would not want to leave them in a program where he is likely to choke somebody.
1987.86-728,2,40998,sheila_l_brogna,,3274.524,3283.364,"That is an assumption we have always made also, but it is predicated upon the school district offering in good faith a reasonable alternative."
1987.86-728,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.699,3383.636,"Thank you, Ms. Brogna."
1987.86-728,3,16803,asher_rubin,,3386.369,3402.676,"Your Honor, Respondent in answering a question from Justice Marshall, indicated that it was significant that when an aid was placed in a classroom with John Doe, there were no further incidents during the year."
1987.86-728,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3425.072,3432.085,"With an emotionally disturbed child, I mean, one expects that that is occasionally the problem."
1987.86-728,3,16803,asher_rubin,,3438.536,3442.252,"--Your Honor, all we have in the Record is that it was a ""violent incident""."
1987.86-728,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.838,3508.21,"Well, but her language... sentences, considering, after going on both sides of all of these factors, the court finds that the balance of these hardships in the public interest way in favor of allowing Plaintiff in there."
1987.86-728,3,16803,asher_rubin,,3510.412,3516.66,"Yes, Your Honor, but it was not based on the presentation of the evidence before the court or on trial."
1987.86-728,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3516.66,3518.801,--of dangerousness because apparently it was not argued.
1987.86-728,3,16803,asher_rubin,,3518.801,3526.391,"Well, Your Honor, I would simply say that that is a conclusionary finding by the court not based on evidence."
