1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,37.008,40.571,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1302,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.371,399.713,"Mr. McMahan, are you talking now about those who were employed by a particular mining operator and who are presumed to have contracted the disease during the period of that employment although their symptoms showed much later?"
1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,399.713,417.386,I am talking about all applicants for benefits payable by a former employer whose employment terminated prior to the enactment of the law that imposed this obligation.
1975.74-1302,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.422,488.052,"Well, I do not see what is irrational about it."
1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,497.289,509.26,"Yes, my contention and unless the Court is prepared to accept that the only question of rationality here is whether the money actually reaches the miners."

1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,559.279,573.574,I think that the scope of the inquiry here is narrow but not as narrow as it would be in the case of more conventional economic regulatory legislation.
1975.74-1302,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.083,596.731,What is suspect about it?
1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,596.731,607.87,"It is suspect because this Court has recognized that laws that have that effect are suspect, not necessarily unconstitutional but worthy of close examination."
1975.74-1302,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.87,614.08,"Well, are coal mine operators now in the classification of racial minorities and aliens?"
1975.74-1302,0,39940,r_r_mcmahan,,614.08,639.111,"No, certainly not, but coal mine operators to the extent that they are now being held responsible to pay benefits to former employers in connection with exposure in the production of a product in the past and the creation of a disease that could not be anticipated and could not be passed on in a pricing are carved out as a class."
