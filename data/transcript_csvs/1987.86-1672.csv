1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.649,"The opinion of the Court in Westfall against Irwin in No. 86-1672, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Jesse C. Bollinger."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,15.891,19.725,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.218,193.541,"There the corporation held the title to the property in its own name, the dummy corporation, didn't it?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,193.541,194.281,That's right.
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.281,205.3,So what this Court said was that the Code simply required the taxpayer to recognize the record state of affairs.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,205.3,205.691,That's right.
1987.86-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.515,267.274,"Mr. Horowitz, do you recognize the exceptions spoken of in dicta in National Carbide for a true agent?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,267.274,268.372,We do.
1987.86-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.624,289.909,"Well, do you accept the explanation in National Carbide of when a true agency might exist?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,289.909,295.385,You mean the so-called six factors that are set out in National Carbide?
1987.86-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.385,295.535,Right.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,295.535,296.474,"Yes, we have no quarrel with those."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.658,324.134,"But here the dummy corporation if you're right in saying, it did follow record state of title."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,328.528,329.708,In this case?
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.708,330.049,Yes.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,330.049,333.892,I don't think the corporation reported any income in this case.
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.821,346.261,On the partners' individual returns.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,346.261,350.064,"Now, basically the partners treated the corporation as a non-existent shell."
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.822,387.64,"What would be needed here in order to make it separately taxable, or reportable on the individuals' returns?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,387.64,392.132,In order for it to be a true agent relationship?
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.533,470.735,"Well, the income here was received by a partnership, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,478.431,493.88,"Well, what happened was the corporation went out and it got a loan from the bank in its own name, didn't purport to be acting as an agent or anything like that, and then it took the loan proceeds and deposited them into an account that was called a construction account."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.95,510.332,"I thought it was Creekside Apartments, a partnership, the account."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,511.351,513.965,--The account was in the name of the partnership.
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.313,516.784,So it wasn't a corporate account?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,516.784,524.95,"It was not labeled as a corporate account, but the property was owned by the corporation and the corporation was the obligor on the loan."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.559,538.471,"Well, this isn't certainly a direct parallel to Moline?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,538.471,540.754,I think it is.
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.949,553.453,"Yes, but there, the gain was recognized or property to which the corporation held title."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,556.145,564.92,"Well, in both cases, the income was attributable to the property in which the corporation held title."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.92,565.921,Why do you say that?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,565.921,578.129,Because the corporation here owned the apartment buildings and the apartments were rented out and the tenants paid rent to the owners--
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.129,580.952,"Well, you say, it was quote attributable close quote."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,587.638,591.09,"--No, that's just, I would say that's a descriptive word."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.267,605.939,"Mr. Horowitz, the partnership didn't own the stock in this corporation, did it?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,607.579,613.065,"Well, I mean, the facts are somewhat confusing."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.065,628.286,"In the other cases, in one more, I don't remember the number, there are five or six cases, one of the cases the sole shareholder is the beneficial owner, and in the other case, some of the other cases, there's a partnership that is treating it as income and the partnership didn't own the corporation, just one of the partners."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,628.286,630.92,"Well, in most of the cases the corporation was solely--"
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.92,631.368,"Well, factually, am I correct?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,631.368,631.789,--Yes.
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.706,673.799,"Well, the argument's whether they were corporate expenses, or the corporation was an agent, and therefore they're the principals' expenses."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,674.18,680.186,"--That's what you get down to, that's the bottom line, but we believe--"
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.186,684.589,And they paid the expenses of a corporate entity that they did not own.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,684.589,688.281,"--No, there's no dispute that the corporation was the obligor on the loan."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.281,696.065,"And also that it was personally guaranteed by the partners in one case, and by the individual shareholder in the other, is that not true?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,696.065,696.205,Yes.
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.205,700.018,So they were personally liable for the debt?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,700.018,700.869,In part.
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.869,708.236,"And they made the regular payments, and they were looked to as the principal obligors, even though they were even though the were in the form of--"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,708.236,710.947,"Well, I think I have to disagree with that statement."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.131,719.525,--Was there a guarantee in the Moline Properties case?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,722.908,738.986,"Well, in the Moline Properties case originally the loan was taken out directly by the individual, and then the bank asked them to set up this corporation and so the corporation then assumed the liability, assumed the mortgage."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.986,750.694,"Do you know from the opinion whether the individual, after the assumption by the corporation, remained liable on the note in the Moline case?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,750.694,769.978,"I don't know whether there was a personal guarantee that was reflected in writing, but the Moline case is clear that the corporation had no bank accounts and had no money in its own name, so it's clear enough that the individual was paying the loan and that the lender was looking to the individual for the payment of the loan."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.978,775.353,"Yes, but the ultimate security was the property whereas here, the ultimate security well--"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,775.353,775.943,No.
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.825,822.586,"--Was that paid out of the CNA account, the interest?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,822.586,828.33,It was paid out of this construction account to which the loan proceeds were dumped as soon as they were received.
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.53,848.572,"Mr. Horowitz, I interrupted you and I apologize, but I didn't give you a chance to answer Justice Scalia's question."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,848.572,852.096,"--At this point, Justice Scalia will have to remind me."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.096,859.719,Which was what more should the taxpayer have done in order to make it a true agency relationship in your view?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,859.719,861.66,"Well, as I started to say--"
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.66,862.942,"You know, not ten things."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,865.944,868.178,"--Well, with an unrelated agent, it's very simple, I think."
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.643,893.496,"Sounds just like an agency, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,893.496,894.437,Not to me.
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.328,923.281,"Well, I interrupted you again, and I'm sorry."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,923.281,927.441,"Well, you keep giving me the opportunity to avoid answering this question."
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.947,959.334,"Cases where it's a clear agent, I mean, but what facts in this particular case would be--"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,959.334,959.933,In this particular situation--
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.933,963.446,"--If you just had to change a couple of facts, what would do the trick?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,963.446,963.626,--No.
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.045,978.717,But it has to be a compensated agency.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,981.22,986.574,"--You can be an agent without being compensated but it's hard to describe it as an arm's length relationship, if there's no compensation."
1987.86-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,986.574,1000.142,"Well, Mr. Horowitz, wouldn't even in an arm's length relationship, the fee for holding bare legal title seems to me could be quite minimal."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1004.416,1008.459,"Well, I don't think it would be zero, because the corporation is doing things."
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.002,1058.596,"--But you'd be satisfied, I take it, if one of these partners had a father who owned a title company and they just went over to the title company and said, would you please hold the title to this property for us, and the company said, sure."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1062.097,1066.531,And the title company doesn't charge any of its clients anything?
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.531,1068.792,"Well, it doesn't charge this one."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1068.792,1074.666,"Well, if it doesn't charge this one, it seems to me, it's not really acting as an arm's length agency."
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.666,1074.816,It's not an agency?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1080.382,1080.83,"Well, no."
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.322,1083.764,"Well, it's an independent corporation."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1090.68,1092.152,"--Well, that's probably all right then."
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.42,1106.563,"So if they went through these same motions they went through here with this title company that I talked about, it would be all right."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1106.563,1108.393,--If it was an unrelated--
1987.86-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.393,1110.684,"And the only problem is the controlled corporation, is that it?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1110.684,1114.958,--That's the problem under the so-called fifth factor of National Carbide.
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.797,1147.331,You're asking for some special rule.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1176.072,1176.302,I think that's right.
1987.86-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.901,1200.228,"So even if it might be enough if your father did it for you, it wouldn't necessarily be enough if a controlled corporation did it for you because you have no other way of controlling your father, whereas you do have another way of controlling a controlled corporation."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1200.228,1200.668,"Well, that's right."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.603,1244.358,"Now, there's another choice, they could use an employee, they could use the secretary in the office as the nominee and give her all the protections, all the guarantees, agree to insure the property and all the rest."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1246.401,1250.705,"Here, they needed to use a corporation."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.705,1256.609,But assume you had a situation for a different reason other than usury that you felt it necessary to use the nominee.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1264.236,1268.256,"Well, if you're using an individual as an agent, you don't run into any of the problems that you have here."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.642,1277.832,You might have different brackets.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1281.846,1286.801,"Well, you might have different brackets, but I don't think we'd be taking... I mean, it's just not a concern."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.293,1293.006,You don't think there's any tax avoidance motive here do you?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1293.006,1296.869,"In setting up the corporation, no."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.563,1397.857,What's wrong with the motive that it may be a little cheaper to form a corporation than to ask some national corporation to use one of their subsidiaries or something like that?
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1402.351,1405.203,"Well, why is it cheaper, Justice Stevens?"
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.856,1409.196,That's right.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1409.196,1416.302,"--Well, and therefore the agent is giving them a break because of the control that the stockholders exert over it."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.302,1423.396,"If all of the legal incidents of the relationship are identical, whether there's compensation or not, why is one an agency and the other not?"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1439.667,1446.402,"Well, I would agree that $100 a year here or there should not, that the Court should not come up with a ruling that's going to make it turn on that."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.683,1498.991,"But the case might be different if the law firm that represented these people formed a corporation and the partners in the law firm just served as stockholders and so forth, and then used this corporation for this purpose."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1499.913,1503.485,"--Well, I think that would be a more difficult issue because you wouldn't have the apparent control there."
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.485,1505.786,You'd have exactly the same control.
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1505.786,1517.835,"Well, I'm not sure what position the Service would take there because I don't think those cases have come up, but it might be that the fact that the partners were paying all the expenses and everything would make them constructive shareholders--"
1987.86-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.835,1518.906,"No, they'd get reimbursed by their clients."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1526.392,1532.116,"--Well, that's what I'm saying, and the fact that they're paying all the expenses, I think, might well make them constructive shareholders of the corporation."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.116,1551.377,"Mr. Horowitz, in Arizona when I practiced, it was a very common practice to have subdivision trusts where a title company would hold title to a large piece of property and charge virtually nothing for holding it because they were going to make their money out of insuring titles in the houses that were built ultimately on that vacant land."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1564.637,1569.271,"Well, if it's an unrelated corporation that held it clearly as an agent--"
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.271,1569.75,"Well, of course--"
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1569.75,1570.842,--Did it take out the loans?
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.842,1572.094,"--No, no."
1987.86-1672,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1585.733,1599.452,"Well, that sounds like an agency relationship to me because you don't have the Moline problem of needing to recognize the corporation as a separate taxable entity, because you don't have a dealing with a controlled corporation."
1987.86-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.146,1690.076,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1692.139,1696.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.059,1815.029,Would you be in great trouble if you went into Court in this tax case in Kentucky and said this corporation that was set up to hold title is just the alter ego for the partnership?
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1815.029,1836.104,"Yes, Justice White, I believe that we would be in terrible trouble because in five of the six projects, the owners of the partnership were two or three individuals only one of whom was Mr. Bollinger who was the sole shareholder in the corporation and there was a nominee in--"
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.104,1840.838,Would you be in any trouble under Kentucky usury laws?
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1840.838,1842.668,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.668,1846.982,So Kentucky wouldn't mind.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1849.223,1854.508,There has not been a case insofar as I know that--
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.508,1859.071,So everybody knows the way around the usury law in Kentucky.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1859.071,1871.289,"--The method used here to comply with the usury statute, and I think it was a compliance, we complied with it by having the loan made in the name of a corporation."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.765,1926.396,Is that really true?
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1951.324,1959.038,"In that situation, Judge Scalia, you have Moline Properties because there you are doing business as a corporation."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.962,1967.924,"So the reality has nothing to do with it, does it?"
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1986.418,1988.659,"I think that is true, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.659,1988.799,All right.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,1990.752,2004.313,"A corporation itself is a fiction, it is a recognized fiction which has separate entity classification for tax purposes, and we recognize that."
1987.86-1672,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2038.796,2044.921,"Mr. Hembree, the tax years involved here are some time ago, a decade or so."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2049.443,2052.024,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1987.86-1672,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2086.929,2096.415,"So you wouldn't have to do this in order to, as you put it, to comply with the Kentucky usury law, rather than to avoid it."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2096.415,2097.606,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2097.606,2098.907,Today you wouldn't have to do it.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2098.907,2099.277,Yes.
1987.86-1672,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2099.277,2099.908,All right.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2099.908,2111.686,"Now, the issue in this case is not whether the nominee corporations can be disregarded as separate entities."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.696,2374.658,"Mr. Hembree, maybe they were agents of the corporation."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2377.87,2398.495,"On that point, Justice Stevens, the only way that they could be agents of the corporation would be if the corporation were the owner of the property and they were operating under that type of an arrangement."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.008,2460.806,"Well, do you mean to say that, suppose, as your opponent suggests, that somebody slipped on the ice in front of the building and brought suit, and they searched the title records, and found... I suppose the record title showed in the corporate entity?"
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2460.806,2461.908,"That is true, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.908,2474.626,"I suppose if they filed a lawsuit against the corporate entity and then the Statute of Limitations ran before the found out who the real true owner was, you'd say they couldn't recover because they sued the wrong party?"
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2474.626,2489.777,"I believe they might be able to recover, but they would be able to recover in the final effect only from the partnership or the proprietorship because--"
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.777,2498.973,"If they didn't name the other people as defendants, just got a judgment against the corporate entity, you don't think they could recover on that judgment and foreclose against the real estate, if they had to."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2498.973,2507.68,"--Any liability that the corporation became liable for, they were indemnified under--"
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.68,2514.143,"They're indemnified but would it not be true that a judgment would be a lien against the real estate, if it was just against the corporation?"
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2514.143,2518.998,"--I believe that would be the correct result, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.998,2520.588,So you can't totally ignore the corporation.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2520.588,2524.782,"No, we don't attempt to ignore the corporation."
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.855,2563.038,How do you distinguish Moline?
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2563.038,2567.29,"I don't distinguish Moline, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.199,2596.098,"Yes, but the Board got reversed."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2596.098,2602.163,And a very important aspect of that and this gets over to a point that was brought up by Mr. Horowitz.
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.163,2605.365,"And of course, the Government in that case was on your side."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2605.365,2610.461,I didn't--
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.461,2618.485,I think the Government's position didn't stand up in the Court of Appeals.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2618.485,2622.817,--It did before this Court Your Honor.
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.817,2625.589,"I know, but not the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2625.589,2635.045,"Well, I think the thing that we're interested in here is what this Court held in Moline Properties, and in that case,--"
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.045,2636.057,"Oh, yeah, all right, go ahead."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2636.057,2659.742,"--this Court, in reversing, or in affirming the Circuit's reversal of the Board of Tax Appeals, held that the separate entity must be recognized and that the income of that separate entity must be reported by it."
1987.86-1672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.028,2683.049,"Of course, that solves the whole case."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2688.885,2710.248,"That's where that assertion is completely and diametrically opposed to the findings of fact of the trial court which were accepted by the Court of Appeals, and there's no basis being pointed out for contesting those facts."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.248,2715.534,Suppose the stock of this corporation had been sold after it had been set up and the money was coming in from the properties.
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2722.339,2722.809,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.634,2756.293,"Counsel, isn't that your distinction with the Moline case, not the fact that they called in the income coming from one or the other, in that case, there was no agency agreement, whereas there was in this case."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2757.564,2760.865,"Well, I think that's a part of it, Your Honor."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.429,2774.616,"I thought the argument in that case was that they should be treated as an agency simply because they were wholly owned by the individual, and that was not enough to establish agency."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2779.52,2800.215,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I believe there are two aspects over the Moline Properties case, number one and the principal part of it was that the sole shareholder was attempting to say I am the sole shareholder and I have the complete beneficial interest of everything the corporation has."
1987.86-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.062,2817.957,"And in other words, the mere fact that I own all the stock is not enough to make me the principal in the corporation an agent."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2819.909,2821.041,That's true.
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.996,2892.658,"--Well, they have to do from year to year for one reason or another under the tax laws or because of my peculiar circumstances, it becomes advantageous from one year to another to shift the income to the corporation or to me, all I have to do is write up the nominee agreement with the corporation saying, you know, I'm the sole shareholder."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2899.864,2904.847,"No, Your Honor, not in terms of shifting the income of the type that we're talking about here."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.222,2924.733,"Well, it's the same thing here."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2932.539,2949.29,"--If that's the agreement, then, it does not stand up because in that instance because it's nothing more than an anticipatory assignment of income, and that is not a proper relationship under the National Carbide case."
1987.86-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.59,2964.813,"Well, why isn't this just as much?"
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,2977.409,2990.96,"Well, I think the big distinction, Justice Scalia, is that the income was not anything that the corporation had any right to under the agreement that is involved."
1987.86-1672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3487.866,3491.138,"Thank you, Mr. Hembree, your time has expired."
1987.86-1672,1,19205,charles_r_hembree,,3491.138,3491.628,--Thank you.
1987.86-1672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.628,3493.93,"Mr. Horowitz, you have three minutes remaining."
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3493.93,3496.632,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1672,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.011,3518.076,--took the contrary position there.
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3518.076,3519.084,--I'm sorry.
1987.86-1672,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.829,3530.351,"Well, the Tax Court got reversed in the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3530.351,3531.633,--That's right.
1987.86-1672,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.633,3541.96,"And the Tax Court agreed with the Government's position because the Government there was trying to stick the taxpayer, the individual, trying to ignore the--"
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3541.96,3550.597,"My recollection is that the dispute was over whether the corporation would have to pay corporate tax and it was the Government that wanted to collect the corporate tax, but I could be wrong."
1987.86-1672,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.818,3555.249,"--You may be, you may be."
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3555.249,3569.088,The point I want to is that Mr. Hembree's statement that the corporation should not be recognized here because it did so little is exactly the contention that was accepted by the Board of Tax Appeals in Moline and reversed by this Court.
1987.86-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3576.605,3579.747,"Well, there wasn't an agency agreement in Moline was there?"
1987.86-1672,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3579.747,3580.267,"--No, there wasn't."
1987.86-1672,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3649.834,3651.556,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz, your time has expired."
