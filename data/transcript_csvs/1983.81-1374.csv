1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,We will hear arguments next in Blum against Stenson.
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,11.206,22.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the state of New York challenges a fee award entered against it under a fee shifting statute."
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.179,153.381,"Mr. Leventhal, that is true of any fee shifting statute, isn't it?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,162.587,163.439,--That's correct.
1983.81-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.964,266.554,"Mr. Leventhal, did you raise your challenge to the use of market rates in calculating these fees in the lower court?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,266.554,277.528,"--Your Honor, we raised in the lower court a claim that the fee award was exorbitant, and we argued in the Second Circuit for the first time that hourly rates should be based upon costs."
1983.81-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.218,300.026,"May I ask, in the same vein, you mentioned at the outset that you never reviewed the time records because they weren't your client and the court should probe deeply into the time records."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,305.711,316.868,"Your Honor, it is our view that the plaintiffs have the burden of producing time records and of producing evidence of proper market rate, of an hourly rate that is appropriate."
1983.81-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.907,331.478,"Did you specifically object to the... Do you question the hours they spent, for example?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,331.478,332.411,"Excuse me, sir?"
1983.81-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.411,339.734,Did you raise any question about the integrity of the time records and the number of hours they claimed to have spent?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,339.734,343.036,We claim that the number of hours they claimed were excessive.
1983.81-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.488,349.357,"I understand that, but did you deny that they actually spent the time they say they spent?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,349.357,351.291,"--No, Your Honor, we did not."
1983.81-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,351.291,354.91,So we can assume that the time records are genuine and not in dispute?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,354.91,355.91,That's correct.
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.91,358.045,"Well, Mr. Leventhal, I am confused."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,364.282,370.353,What was filed with the District Court was an affidavit listing the hours expended by counsel.
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.555,373.855,Yes.
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,373.855,374.805,"--no, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.805,377.923,No such records were filed by the plaintiffs in support of their application?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,377.923,378.256,That's correct.
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.379,391.414,That was the substance of their affidavit?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,391.414,392.783,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.783,401.169,Was there any evidence put in with respect to how many hours a year a lawyer of this status and stature would have?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,413.077,415.779,"Your Honor, that is one approximation."
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.856,438.295,"Well, that is a lawyer who has the obligations of running the firm, besides taking care of the clients."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,438.295,439.913,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.913,451.721,"There are studies extant, the American Bar and others, that lawyers at the lower echelons in the law firm can put in 2,000 charged hours a year."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,451.721,455.256,"Indeed they can, Your Honor, and that is relevant--"
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,455.256,461.243,That would mean at the rate they were allowed here these men would be paid at the rate of what?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,468.747,472.885,"--$150 an hour total, a $100 base rate and a 50 percent multiplier."
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,472.885,473.368,"Oh, I see."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,475.337,477.92,"No, Your Honor, it is $100 plus 50 percent."
1983.81-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.202,502.987,"Are you going to spell that out any more, Mr. Leventhal?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,507.891,511.26,"--Your Honor, the courts have struggled with that."
1983.81-1374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,530.887,538.577,"Well, what is the going rate for civil liberties lawyers in New York?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,538.577,541.362,"Your Honor, I don't believe we've ever calculated that."
1983.81-1374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,541.362,543.564,"Well, what are you going to measure it by?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,543.564,560.424,"Your Honor, we think that a reasonable approach would entail paying an attorney for the value of his time based upon his counterpart at a private law firm plus a percentage of the non-profit organization's overhead attributable to that particular attorney."
1983.81-1374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.57,583.02,I sure wish that was retroactive.
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,585.372,610.753,"The critical deficiency in the market rate approach, even one that entails a meaningful effort to obtain solid information, is that the taxpayers of New York are not to be forced to pay two aspects of that market rate that produce windfalls to a non-profit lawyer."
1983.81-1374,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,678.295,684.199,"Incidentally, when fees are allowed, do they go to the Society or do they go to the Society's lawyers?"
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,684.199,687.151,"--They go to the Society, Justice Blackmun."
1983.81-1374,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,687.151,688.336,No question about this?
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,688.336,690.002,There is no dispute.
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.012,813.631,"There is no claim, I take it, that there is such an overhead with respect to the Society here."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,813.631,815.333,--That amount?
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,815.333,815.916,Yes.
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,815.916,816.566,"No, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,819.785,821.587,"This is the going rate, in other words."
1983.81-1374,0,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,821.587,824.272,"No, it is entirely speculative."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1623.364,1648.348,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I would like before launching into my argument to have some general principles up front."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.809,1826.546,I take it they have abandoned that notion in the Court of Appeals.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1826.546,1831.165,Having been unsuccessful at least before Judge Sweet they have indeed abandoned it.
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.853,1846.441,"But the Court of Appeals entertained that, didn't it?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1846.441,1848.793,"The Court of Appeals, well, entertained it."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.328,1853.113,"Well, I know, but so it was there."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1853.113,1854.763,It was before the Court of Appeals.
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.763,1856.315,And they accepted it.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1859.101,1860.051,"No, they did not."
1983.81-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.559,1906.415,"There is a certain element there of on whom is the burden of proof, isn't there, Mr. Silverman?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1906.415,1906.998,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.998,1938.367,"If the state is obligated to justify by a certain prima facie case the attorneys' fees which it has... rather, if the plaintiffs are seeking to justify it, if they are obligated to come forth with a prima facie case, if they didn't, the fact that the defendants might have utterly devastated their showing even further by cross examination or by discovery doesn't make up for the lack of a prima facie case on the part of the party who has to show it."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1938.367,1965.352,"It surely would not, Your Honor, but let me suggest that a prima facie case was well made out here by the submission of affidavits, the digest of the time records, and the submission of memoranda which called the court's attention to what the Society felt were comparable cases submitted on the other side were the citation of other cases which the state thought were comparable."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.515,2109.96,"Well, Mr. Silverman, unless you had really some support in the legislative history that would foreclose the kind of an approach that is suggested by your colleague on the other side, you might be in trouble."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2109.96,2119.916,"If Your Honor please, I do not think that the legislative history is fairly to be determined when the Congress has considered and rejected."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.349,2121.732,All right.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2144.364,2146.297,"--Your Honor, I think that I have, if I--"
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.297,2148.147,"But, of course, you--"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2148.147,2166.525,"--I may live to regret these words, but I think I have the easier case in demonstrating that the legislative history manifests the Congress's intention that fees should be awarded on the prevailing rate in the community test."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.464,2194.361,"--By that you would mean that a law professor who takes a particular case just on appeal, for example, where it is easier to measure the time, has no significant overhead, can charge the same as Sullivan and Cromwell or your firm or--"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2194.361,2195.878,"No, sir."
1983.81-1374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.688,2240.842,--Does the history say anything about this overhead business?
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2240.842,2242.842,"Not a word, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.461,2280.133,And you pay a Wall Street lawyer with an office in Wall Street more than you pay a lawyer with offices on Madison Avenue.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2280.133,2289.656,"Well, I... There are an infinite number... You may have to pay the Wall Street lawyers different sums based on the following."
1983.81-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.07,2346.825,"Mr. Silverman, suppose... Is your only objecting to the figuring in of the overhead factor the difficulty of getting the statistics?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2387.152,2409.535,"--Well, Your Honor, the answer is, I don't think that the same... that the lawyers... Given the same case, and Lawyer A and Lawyer B having worked side by side, and the stipulations which Your Honor refers to are entered into, I should think that they would both get the same amount."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.641,2425.878,"Yes, but in Justice Rehnquist's example, who would get hurt?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2440.621,2443.423,--I have yet to hear of such stipulations.
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.481,2471.092,"Of course, most of the firms... I have asked a good many firms, what does it cost you a year for your first year associate, and they have an answer right on the tip of their tongue--"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2471.092,2472.692,"Your Honor... Forgive me, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2563.583,2564.051,--Mr. Silverman--
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2565.485,2566.018,"Certainly, sir."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2566.018,2567.637,I think it is relevant to what you are saying.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2588.964,2591.583,"Your Honor, they are not identical, but they are within ranges."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2591.583,2592.602,"Oh, within range?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2592.602,2603.558,"Yes, and if I may suggest it, Your Honor, the way the courts have for... I don't mean to be irreverent... for donkeys' years dealt with this problem."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2610.829,2611.646,What is the prevailing rate--
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2611.646,2613.348,The courts have done this now for decades.
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2613.348,2618.067,--What is the prevailing rate for the Wall Street law firms for first year associates?
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2618.067,2621.019,Somewhere between $65 and $85 today.
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2621.019,2622.121,First year?
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2622.121,2625.156,For first year lawyers.
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2625.156,2626.706,Without clerking any--
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2626.706,2627.556,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2627.556,2629.275,--First year associates.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2629.275,2631.227,First year associates.
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2633.293,2636.445,"You said $65,000 to $80,000?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2636.445,2638.361,Not... I am sorry.
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2639.48,2639.947,No.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2639.947,2641.447,Forgive me if I--
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2641.447,2643.099,What is the... I thought you said thousands.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2644.082,2676.586,"--The hourly rate is between $65 and about $80 to $85 an hour for a person out of law school, and let me hasten to add that if a person comes to a law firm having served as a law secretary or clerk for a member of the Supreme Court, he is not a first year associate, he comes in as a second or a third year associate, depending upon how much time he has clerked for various judges, and that rate is commensurately higher."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2676.586,2681.307,Are associate lawyers paid the same in the various New York law offices?
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2681.307,2687.228,"For the major firms, there tends to be a kind of standard."
1983.81-1374,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2687.228,2687.828,Yes.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2687.828,2704.505,"Now, that standard sometimes gets out of whack because raises come into effect on January 1st or September 1st, and the associates are not terribly bashful about pointing out to the law firms when they feel that the law firms are falling behind--"
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.205,2742.528,"Mr. Silverman, don't you acknowledge that there is a great difference in the problem of fixing fees now and let us say 50 years ago or 40 years ago in cases of this kind?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2742.528,2747.499,"--Your Honor, I do not think that the process would differ."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.945,2793.48,"Well, that is a little more complicated than running a law firm, isn't it?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2793.48,2800.967,"--The running of a law firm, Your Honor, since I am doing it for mine, I know of nothing more complicated."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2852.519,2859.69,Let me suggest a hypothetical that might not be so complicated that it would need a CPA and a ten-year study to resolve.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2892.894,2895.096,"Your Honor, it is a--"
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.096,2896.465,It is a perfectly legitimate profit.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2898.098,2907.836,--I don't want to be seen to be adopting words the implications of which I am not comfortable with.
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.705,2912.074,"Well, let's call it--"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2912.074,2913.207,--It's a funny thing in a law firm.
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.207,2914.426,--Let's call it markup then.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2916.059,2919.311,More than you pay the young man for his salary.
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2919.311,2925.115,"Now, some of that is because the firm is taking a certain measure of responsibility."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2928.5,2929.619,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.619,2936.09,But they can readily calculate what is the overhead factor to be assigned to that associate.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2936.09,2937.156,I suggest--
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2937.156,2938.475,They don't need a CPA for that either.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2938.475,2941.826,"--Your Honor, I suggest that that is a most complicated problem."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.826,2944.445,"Well, having done it myself, I--"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2944.445,2945.761,But you... Forgive me.
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.761,2946.997,--I think it is not all that complicated.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2946.997,2952.901,"Your Honor, I heard, I read Judge Friendly say that's not complicated."
1983.81-1374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.307,3021.295,"Mr. Silverman, may I ask one other question that you went by rather rapidly earlier?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3034.317,3034.734,--The costs?
1983.81-1374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.734,3034.984,Yes.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3035.767,3038.936,My friends raised it in argument.
1983.81-1374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.738,3044.256,"--In oral argument, or was it in their briefs?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3044.256,3045.023,--In their briefs.
1983.81-1374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.542,3051.327,"Because it's... They have a very conscientious panel and didn't even mention the issue, I see."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3051.327,3062.717,"--Because it is... if I may suggest it, it is bizarre, and I don't really know why we are here."
1983.81-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.535,3093.587,"Well, you are here presumably because at least four Justices of this Court voted to grant certiorari."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3093.587,3111.215,"Your Honor, I believe that had the Justices of this Court seen our Appendix 3, and been persuaded as I urge that you be persuaded, that this does not manifest some hog wild approach to the public fisc."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.551,3143.603,"Well, Mr. Silverman, there may be another reason for granting cert, because there is another issue in your case."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3143.603,3144.788,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.49,3148.457,How about the 50 percent?
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3148.457,3149.573,--I beg... The bonus?
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.894,3155.144,"Well, I mean, that is an issue, isn't it?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3155.144,3156.513,It surely is.
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.315,3166.219,"And there is some... there is disagreement around the country on that, isn't there?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3166.219,3174.075,"--Your Honor, I do not consider that there is disagreement with respect to the upward adjustment of the lodestar."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.975,3254.01,"Well, it certainly just didn't depend on winning the lawsuit."
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3254.01,3275.44,"Oh, I do not believe that that depends only upon winning the lawsuit, but in this case the judge held, having looked at comparable cases around the country, that an upward enhancement was justified, as I believe has been held by all of the courts around the country."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.859,3305.809,It is part of the prevailing rates in the community.
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3305.809,3317.5,"Precisely, Your Honor, and that has been determined again in the legislative history to be permissible as not, and I repeat, not producing a windfall."
1983.81-1374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3317.5,3320.135,"And the contingency is part of that factor, is it?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3320.135,3323.487,"Your Honor, contingency means various things to various people."
1983.81-1374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.241,3390.548,"So you are not suggesting then that it would be proper to make an award based on what a contingency, a regular contingency fee lawyer might charge?"
1983.81-1374,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3390.548,3394.083,Not on the basis that you are going to pay him for unsuccessful cases.
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3577.319,3591.962,"Your Honor, may it please the court, the present calculation of hourly rates and amounts of award are rough estimates in many, many respects."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3661.209,3666.677,I suppose if the city had won its case... Is it the city or the state?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3666.677,3667.196,The state.
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.196,3667.646,The state.
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3677.301,3678.268,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.268,3680.353,How would you like to cost justify that?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3680.353,3688.526,"Your Honor, the fact is that the courts have held that we are under those circumstances required to look at the ability of the Legal Aid Society to pay."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3688.526,3693.68,"I know, but on your theory you would have to cost justify."
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3693.68,3695.196,I think we can estimate it.
1983.81-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3820.677,3823.796,May I ask one other question about the proceedings in the lower court?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3830.366,3831.651,"No, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3831.651,3832.668,You just said this was too high?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3832.668,3837.555,We said it was too high and that the plaintiffs have the burden of establishing what the market rate is.
1983.81-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3837.555,3837.905,Right.
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3845.744,3846.294,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3846.294,3849.446,"You tell us how to figure it, I know, by this cost accounting."
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3849.446,3866.407,"And we are saying at bottom that it is improper to bill the state of New York for a non-profit organization for the time, for that part of the award that goes to pay a profit to a partner in a firm and that goes to pay the fancy overhead of a major firm."
1983.81-1374,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3866.407,3871.692,Under your approach have you figured what this fee should have been?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3871.692,3882.481,"No, Your Honor, we have not, but in the Willowbrook case, we have found acceptable an hourly rate of $75 an hour, the breakpoint rate."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3893.271,3924.041,"Well, Mr. Leventhal, I still don't understand how you could fail under your approach to insisting on cost accounting for fees when no non-profit organization is involved, but just private lawyers, individual lawyers or individual lawyers attached to law firms, because I would think, as you say, there are just hundreds of law firms, two-man, three-man."
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3924.041,3926.01,That's correct.
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.01,3930.814,Wouldn't you have to do that with every fee award to a private organization?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3933.848,3936.314,"Your Honor, if we can adjust--"
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3936.314,3936.848,Wouldn't you?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3936.848,3937.764,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3937.764,3938.631,What would you do then?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3941.033,3942.218,"Your Honor, we would--"
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3942.218,3942.885,Would you or not?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3942.885,3945.337,--We would not go to a prevailing market rate.
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3945.337,3945.92,What would you do?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3945.92,3946.42,We would--
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3946.42,3948.203,"Not cost, not prevailing market."
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3948.872,3950.105,"--We would estimate it, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.105,3951.572,Estimate on what basis?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3951.572,3955.276,"On the basis of the total costs, the total overhead of the law firm."
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.276,3959.978,So you would do a cost accounting based on each individual law firm.
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3959.978,3962.53,"Well, cost accounting, if you mean a complex--"
1983.81-1374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3962.53,3968.516,"Well, I mean, you would do an estimate on each, and your estimate might be one thing for one law firm and another for another."
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3968.516,3969.483,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-1374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3972.235,3975.689,Which law firm would you compare in this case?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3975.689,3978.724,--To the Legal Aid Society?
1983.81-1374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3978.724,3979.707,Yes.
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3979.707,3982.593,"At the very least, a very small law firm with low overhead."
1983.81-1374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3984.545,3987.413,A law firm with no overhead?
1983.81-1374,2,36217,melvyn_r_leventhal,,3987.413,3988.013,Low overhead.
