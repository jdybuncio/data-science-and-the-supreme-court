1974.74-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.749,848.137,Now you're talking about the second order.
1974.74-156,0,37578,oretta_d_sears,,848.137,849.349,That's correct.
1974.74-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.125,906.944,The District Attorney in -- there's one District Attorney in each California County?
1974.74-156,0,37578,oretta_d_sears,,906.944,907.535,That's correct.
1974.74-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.535,910.268,Elected by the people for about a four-year term of office?

1974.74-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.984,916.252,And then the deputies and the assistance are appointed by him?
1974.74-156,0,37578,oretta_d_sears,,916.252,922.037,"That's correct, and that only with his -- in his name."
1974.74-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1280.28,1286.324,Very well.
1974.74-156,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1288.402,1291.723,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-156,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.206,1405.757,Did the magistrate had herself viewed the film?
1974.74-156,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1405.757,1406.87,Himself.
1974.74-156,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1406.87,1408.431,Yeah.
1974.74-156,2,37578,oretta_d_sears,,1408.431,1408.966,That's correct.
1974.74-156,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.776,1462.964,Same title though?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1462.964,1463.804,Of the same titles --
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.804,1464.025,Yes.
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1464.025,1469.236,But different content.
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1489.51,1490.765,Under statutory proceedings?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1490.765,1492.292,"No, it is not."
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.706,1564.261,"And the object -- the element object of that proceeding would have been the permanent what, the destruction of the film?"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1564.261,1564.878,It would have been.
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.586,1577.671,As ancillaries to some other proceeding or is it end of itself?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1577.671,1579.134,"Well, either way."
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1728.49,1736.343,"Mr. Smith, somewhere can you straighten out for me the juxtaposition of Judge Ferguson and Judge Lydick?"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1736.343,1738.621,"Oh yes, I'm glad you raised that."
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1817.344,1818.447,"Who certify, what --"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1818.447,1819.443,He certified it --
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1819.443,1820.33,He certified the --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1820.33,1822.114,"-- on that date, same day."
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1822.114,1822.851,He certified the --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1822.851,1823.123,Yes he did.
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1823.123,1824.345,-- necessity for the three-judge court.
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1824.345,1825.725,Correct.
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.172,1844.343,And who petitioned?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1844.343,1857.231,"And who certified, rather it was assigned to Judge Ferguson another U.S. District Court judge and a Circuit Court judge and a third judge."
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.412,1867.471,Why not?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1867.471,1874.101,"Why not, because I feel that there are maybe misjudged but I feel there are more critical issues in the case than that."
1974.74-156,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.501,1909.385,Did you --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1909.385,1910.292,What?
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.292,1910.672,(Inaudible)
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1910.672,1911.537,Yeah.
1974.74-156,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.537,1919.968,Did you ever object to the three-judge court that was actually convened that you thought there had been a jurisdictional error?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1919.968,1922.224,I can't say that we did.
1974.74-156,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1925.993,1932.274,Or do you think this came about Chief Judge Chamber surely knows what the statute says?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1932.274,1956.532,"Well, I think it came about if you look at proceedings on December 5th, 1973, six days after this action was filed, you'll notice that the same panel was assigned to consolidate -- a number of consolidated cases and in those cases they discussed abstention California statute."
1974.74-156,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1967.948,1969.417,Also obscenity cases?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1969.417,1976.874,Also obscenity cases and apparently they were assigned apparently by the Ninth Circuit to handle these issues.
1974.74-156,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1980.639,1982.854,"If you prevail on this point, you win your lawsuit, don't you?"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1982.854,1987.26,Yes and we urge it we've urged it into the briefs.
1974.74-156,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1987.26,1995.421,Are you going to touch on the question that Judge Ferguson's changing position about the recusal?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1995.421,1997.298,"Well, I think it speaks for itself."
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.624,2034.908,"Well, it's not unheard of any judge that has a misapprehension about whether or not he owns the stock in some company or whether or not he thinks he may know some of the persons involved and it turns out to be another person by the same name?"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2034.908,2036.864,"No, that is not so here."
1974.74-156,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.458,2085.817,"Well isn't it conceivable too that Judge Ferguson this could have come to me or one of the other 15 judges of the central district would say I -- there's not, possibly I'm biased, I won't sit."
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2102.425,2106.497,"That's possible, apparently he did."
1974.74-156,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2106.497,2113.593,Mr. Smith what is your position as to the finding by the District Court of harassment?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2113.593,2117.873,"Well, if the District Court Judge Lydick is on that three-judge District Court --"
1974.74-156,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2117.873,2119.591,The three-judge court?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2119.591,2128.655,The three-judge court simply resided the facts of reference to the warrant and said they speak for themselves.
1974.74-156,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2203.737,2208.246,"Mr. Smith, was there any hearing on this issue of harassment?"
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2208.246,2216.222,"Well no, except into the extent that there was a hearing on the TRO by Judge Lydick prior to the convening of the three-judge court."
1974.74-156,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2229.515,2235.339,Are you saying Mr. Smith that the three-judge court which now did not include Judge Lydick overruled --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2235.339,2239.377,"That's precisely what I'm saying, yes and correct."
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.683,2242.497,"But they have nowhere to go, they have affidavits."
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2242.497,2245.942,"They had no, indeed the very same affidavits --"
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.942,2246.77,The same affidavits.
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2246.77,2254.855,"The same, in fact the counsel were present before Judge Lydick and argued the matter, the same affidavits were presented."
1974.74-156,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2258.739,2260.985,They didn't hear the counsel at all?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2260.985,2272.771,"No, they did not, they did offer counsel the opportunity to present additional affidavits and additional materials but no additional material was in fact presented."
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.947,2297.843,You said there are complaints --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2297.843,2298.572,Criminal complaint.
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2298.572,2302.452,When was that filed in relation to the day of the filing of the federal lawsuit?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2302.452,2307.953,The criminal complaint against the employees was filed prior to the federal action.
1974.74-156,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.056,2398.261,Were the appellees in this case parties to the Municipal Court per se?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2398.261,2399.467,"Oh, absolutely!"
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2417.294,2420.803,But were they -- are different prints of the same film?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2420.803,2421.622,"No, they were different."
1974.74-156,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2426.259,2426.919,Deep Throat.
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2426.919,2440.59,But apparently what happened was as pointed out here on page 48 that what they did was -- is in another instance came on with what they call a “soft virgin” first.
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.887,2627.899,Referring to the State Court of Appeals --
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2627.899,2628.536,State Court of Appeals.
1974.74-156,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2628.536,2629.492,In San Diego?
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2629.492,2631.5,In San Diego.
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.955,2703.276,(Inaudible)
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2703.276,2704.259,"Yes, it's in the appendix."
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.776,2714.803,(Inaudible)
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2714.803,2721.59,"I'm reading from the transcript to the proceedings of August 12, 1974 before Judge Lydick."
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.59,2724.075,(Inaudible)
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2724.075,2726.108,Yes it is.
1974.74-156,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.19,2734.817,It was filed.
1974.74-156,3,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2734.817,2735.63,Yes it is filed.
1974.74-156,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.422,2775.341,Mr. Fleishman.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2775.341,2779.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2794.827,2801.929,"Would you address yourself to the question of personnel competition, three-judge court."
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2801.929,2802.385,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.12,2807.572,"Very well, we'll wait for it."
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2807.572,2810.087,"No, I will do that because I was there."
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.514,2887.166,"Well, in the interim has Judge Lydick were into the case?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2887.166,2914.429,"Yes, when Judge Ferguson withdrew, it was assigned to Judge Lydick, but then as I say the complaint was amended to withdraw from it, the money damage aspect and again in this connection Judge Chambers selected the Court and gave to the parties an opportunity to object that they had any objection to the composition of the Court and no objection was filed at all."
1974.74-156,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.921,2934.123,Quite end up that Ferguson-Lydick and Ellie is that it?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2934.123,2937.424,"No, it was Ferguson, Ellie and Easton."
1974.74-156,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.008,2939.078,And Lydick was out?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2939.078,2940.373,And Lydick was out.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2940.373,2943.866,What do you have Mr. Fleishman of the requirement statutes.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2943.866,2944.425,The statute was --
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2944.425,2949.274,He certified -- Judge Lydick certified the necessity for the three-judge court.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2953.975,2959.741,The practice is the judge to whom the case is originally assigned and Judge Ferguson was originally assigned to the case.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2961.842,2962.97,"No, that's not my question."
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2962.97,2964.343,Yes sir.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2964.343,2969.846,I'm trying to find that out Judge Ferguson could've been appointed by Chief Judge Chambers.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2969.846,2973.435,I think part of the explanation Mr. Justice Brennan is --
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2973.435,2979.226,"Under the statute may he do that, isn't he required to assign the certifying judge?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2979.226,2980.269,I think not Your Honor.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.269,2982.697,I see.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2982.697,2983.62,I would like to --
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.62,2986.515,I guess we'll have to decide that Mr. Fleishman.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2986.515,2999.089,"That maybe a question although I hope that in deciding if Your Honors keep in mind that Judge Ferguson was drawn by lot, Judge Ferguson was no stranger to this litigation at all."
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2999.089,3002.576,"But he was drawn by lot as a single judge, was it not?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3002.576,3007.429,And under the three-judge court statute then he should be one of the members of the three-judge court.
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.429,3012.672,"Even though himself, there maybe a question of whether it is not out of the case then for all purposes."
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3022.07,3026.911,"That I -- yes that is a question, our answer to the question as I have indicated."
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.911,3030.391,But you rely also that no objection was made when opportunity was given.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3030.391,3030.995,Absolutely.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3030.995,3034.313,That both sides I gather to object and not to the panel as composed.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3034.313,3035.855,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.855,3040.428,"If it's very simple, although that would make no difference, would it?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3040.428,3048.684,Ordinarily jurisdictional questions are not waived although that is not a universal rule either as I've been learning.
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3216.031,3222.533,"If we held in handling that we had not said in Miller that Roth Memoirs was vague, didn't we?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3222.533,3231.161,"I had read that it's saying that Roth Memoirs with the specificity, with the Miller specificity read into it was not vague."
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.122,3249.927,"You don't mean written in the statute itself, you mean construed in one way or another."
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3249.927,3270.155,"Construed it, oh yes, I don't mean -- attack here is not that's it's not in the statute everybody concedes it's not in the statute, but what was involved here is that even as it was construed by the California courts there was no itemized lists of sexual conduct indeed --"
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.155,3277.004,But what if there been an itemized list in the construction of Section 1461 by this Court?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3278.04,3284.921,"Well, the A and B that have been given as plain examples of kind of material."
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.921,3297.648,But there's been no itemized list and surely these courts of California have as much freedom in administering obscenity statue written by the California legislature as this Court does in administering one written by Congress.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3297.648,3299.048,I haven't any doubt about that.
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.511,3453.063,"Well, is that any less of a guideline in our construction of 1461 in the Reel's case and in Hamling?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3453.063,3458.726,"I would say so, if Miller's requirement of specificity Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.74-156,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.726,3465.452,But we said in Hamling that Miller wasn't a legislative drafting manually that you didn't have to do exactly what Miller has said.
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3465.452,3483.785,"No, but you also said that Miller was a constitutional requirement that as a constitutional requirement that due process required that there be specific sexual conduct itemized either in the statute or by judicial construction."
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3564.682,3568.831,A similar case has not yet been taken by Supreme Court?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3568.831,3586.04,"As a matter of fact, after this Court had taken this case and I have called it to the Court's attention just about two or three weeks ago, the California Supreme Court has taken the case called People against Nisenoff (ph) where that is issue is finally coming up to the --"
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3586.04,3589.998,"Well, would that -- what Court have decided this --"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3589.998,3604.828,"Nisenoff (ph) was decided by another intermediate court, Enskat had been decided by a Court of Appeal down in Los Angeles and Nisenoff (ph) was decided by Court of equal level up north."
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3604.828,3606.774,Did the Nisenoff (ph) Court follow Enskat?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3606.774,3607.85,Exactly.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3607.85,3610.451,"I see, so the very Enskat issue is now before the Supreme Court?"
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3610.451,3612.874,Exactly.
1974.74-156,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3612.874,3614.175,That hasn't been argued?
1974.74-156,4,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3614.175,3620.367,That has not been argued Your Honor.
1974.74-156,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4054.342,4055.115,Mr. Rosenwein.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4055.115,4060.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4213.804,4215.006,So whose there?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4215.006,4215.688,The police officer.
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4215.688,4216.772,They have been told?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4216.772,4218.427,They had been told by the District Attorney.
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4218.427,4220.215,They who have been told were the?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4220.215,4221.81,Police officers.
1974.74-156,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4266.82,4267.776,What page are you on?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4267.776,4278.582,"I'm on page five of my own brief, but they actually -- it also appears in the findings of the Court and you'll find that in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement."
1974.74-156,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4382.009,4387.843,But that's because their conclusion was after viewing that the pictures were essentially the same.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4387.843,4389.149,Exactly.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4401.29,4408.903,Mr. Rosenwein I hope you're going to give some time to whether or not we have jurisdiction of this case and weather Younger should've been filed.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4408.903,4410.827,"Well, alright then let me just see."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4413.584,4418.489,Because I gather these things were all irrelevant if we've decided we don't have jurisdiction in this appeal.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4418.489,4437.003,"Yes, but these four seizures were all done, we say of the identical film and in addition, some month or two later at the criminal trial and pretrial proceedings for the purposes of the trial, they conceded that these films were identical and they needed only one."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4453.411,4456.098,What's the appeal here is from?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4457.164,4461.575,The appeal -- there's only -- I think --
1974.74-156,5,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4461.575,4469.835,"May I emphasize what Mr. Justice Brennan is asking, there seems to be a great desire on the part of both sides of the council table to avoid this issue."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4472.498,4475.71,"Now, let me start just from the beginning then on that."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4509.633,4512.288,"Well as I understood, if I may tell you what bothers me."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4512.288,4515.648,Yes.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4515.648,4524.518,This is direct appeal from an order to this Court and if it's properly here that's because there was some kind of injunctive order below.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4526.849,4532.755,"There was an injunctive order, but I don't think I'd say literally there was of course an injunctive order."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4534.449,4536.833,I'm speaking of the two orders and what these two have said?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4536.833,4538.922,There's only one really before this Court I think.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4548.298,4550.544,And that's an adjunctive order?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4550.544,4550.951,Yes.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4550.951,4554.44,You think you'll agree and an appeal was taken from that order here.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4554.44,4555.953,Yes and I am saying and I --
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4555.953,4568.701,"Now, the next thing I'm interested in, if we have jurisdiction should the three-judge court had followed Younger and this --"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4568.701,4572.329,"No, I don't think Younger was applicable here, I think this was Steffel."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4572.329,4577.783,"There was a pending as I understand it, at least at the time of any order in the three-judge court."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4583.18,4588.791,"At the time the amended judgment was filed, yes at that time there was."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4588.791,4595.854,And when with relation to the firing of the federal suit was that state criminal proceeding begun?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4595.854,4610.456,"The state criminal proceeding against the two employees was begun first, then came the federal complaint six weeks later; six weeks later after service of the complaint, they amended to include these two appellees."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4610.456,4617.588,"Right, but as after that, before you had the first judgment order of the three-judge court."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4617.588,4618.887,And I think that -- I think that's correct --
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4618.887,4626.825,And meanwhile there had been additional proceedings involving these appellants in the state courts?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4626.825,4633.09,"Yes, but those were -- those had nothing to do with the problems that were then in the federal court."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4633.09,4638.109,Why do you say in that circumstance that Younger does not apply?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4638.109,4648.742,"Well, for this reason, first, if we follow Steffel, we had filed first our compliant filed by these two appellees was filed first."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4666.258,4669.726,May I suggest I don't understand Younger that way.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4679.969,4687.23,"Well, we couldn't have I would say relegating us to that Court would have not resulted and the answer to the Constitution."
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4693.857,4703.747,"Well, you might told us to a petition for hearing to the Supreme Court of California at the San Diego Court of Appeals decided against on your constitutional claim, didn't you?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4703.747,4704.924,In which case are you referring to?
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4704.924,4709.405,"Well, had you taken your case up through the California Court System."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4713.305,4713.552,Yes.
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4713.552,4719.389,But you could've then asked the Supreme Court of California for him if you'd lost in the Court of Appeals.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4721.627,4739.245,"Yes, I assume one can say that one could go through the entire situation again, but Enskat had just been decided, the defendant the appellants here themselves come and said to the District Court, Enskat has decided this and there's nothing that you can do about it."
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4748.106,4749.444,Mr. Rosenwein.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4749.444,4750.33,To --
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4750.33,4751.328,"Oh, I'm sorry, finish it."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4752.055,4757.205,I just want to say that the three-judge court found was a deliberate attempt to circumvent.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4757.205,4758.694,With an exception.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4758.694,4760.806,They wanted to circumvent the jurisdiction of the Court.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4760.806,4765.391,"Well, you mean that was -- it was the finding of harassment within the Younger exception is that what you say?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4765.391,4786.372,"No, I mean that there was a finding that the filing of this amendment to their criminal complaint to include these appellees six weeks after they had started that action was intended in bad faith to circumvent the jurisdiction of the federal court which we had invoked and we had invoked simply a violation of the Heller rule."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4792.297,4800.071,Well Mr. Fleishman has told us that some other litigators exceeded in getting the Enskat issue before the California Supreme Court.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4813.796,4825.603,"Mr. Justice Brennan, here is our situation on that, you have an Enskat decision, you have this -- all of these people coming in and saying this is a binding law, we understand to be the binding law."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4845.232,4853.009,"Well, I gather you're suggesting that means the Supreme Court is going to follow Enskat, but then you've come here wouldn't you or try to get here."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4853.009,4879.452,"Well, what I'm saying is the time nine months ago when we were there before the District Court it had a clear situation of an attempted circumvention, it had an Enskat case, that the binding law everybody agreed that it was and we had filed our complaint first and had not -- has invoked the federal court's jurisdiction before."
1974.74-156,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4880.454,4899.956,"Do you suggest that the Younger doctrine is limited to where the state law or where state courts having decided the federal question that was in the case, but if the state courts have already taken a position on the federal question of the case, you may ignore Younger, is that it?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4899.956,4903.517,"No, what I'm saying is that we had one other reason."
1974.74-156,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4908.202,4913.369,You say we don't need to go to the state court because they've already decided the issue.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4913.369,4931.922,"We simply said that one of the reasons why it would be purposeless for federal court to relegate us back to the state court is you've had a ruling from the state court today, yesterday which says, our statute as we construe it is constitutional."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4954.262,4956.456,This is a 1983 suit?
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4956.456,4959.019,Yes it's a 1983 suit.
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4959.019,4967.341,"Mr. Rosenwein, did your original application asked for a three-judge court?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4967.341,4968.156,Yes it did.
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4968.156,4970.123,It did.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4974.399,4976.697,Judge Lydick certified.
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4976.697,4985.935,"Well the statute says that on the filing that he shall immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, that was Judge Lydick right?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4985.935,4987.283,Yes.
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4987.283,4996.528,"Who shall designate two other judges to sit with it, does this comply with the statute?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,4996.528,5005.865,"Well, if this is were to be considered mandatory and I consider it directory not mandatory, but if because it would -- I know but Your Honor that it --"
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5005.865,5006.93,It's not mandatory.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5006.93,5013.274,"If it's not mandatory, we have a situation -- I'll tell you what the situation it's in the record there have been --"
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5013.274,5015.58,"Who shall, is not mandatory?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5015.58,5019.79,"Shall and may as Your Honor know is very often, vary in meaning."
1974.74-156,5,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5047.445,5064.918,"Mr. Rosenwein are you departing now from your associates posture, I thought that he took the position that under the statute it was Judge Ferguson to whom the application for injunction or other relief was originally presented."
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5064.918,5078.01,Yes but I think that would be another reason why it was appropriate for Chief Judge Chambers to point -- I refer as Judge Ferguson as one of the members.
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5090.267,5094.008,Actually I never heard of it before.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5101.078,5102.184,"Yes, I think that this true."
1974.74-156,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5104.462,5106.618,Assume you could call that a statute.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5106.618,5114.404,"Yes that would be ordinarily be followed, but unless it's mandatory I would not conceive it is something."
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5198.621,5200.35,"Well that is injunctive, isn't it?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5200.35,5219.212,"Yes it is, (Voice Overlap) but this Court has said that 1253 is kind of a statute that should not be literally construed that are there maybe cases where it would be helpful for judicial economy etcetera to commit the appeals to go to the Ninth Circuit, I think this is one."
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5233.101,5236.475,Did I understand you to say that's either discretion whether we take this one.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5236.475,5240.817,"What I understood from Gonzales, I understood from Gonzales that --"
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5240.817,5242.791,Discretionary in Gonzales --
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5242.791,5255.303,At least policy wise that one could say that we would not take this thing because this is not an injunction that restrains the enforcement of the statute because of its unconstitutionality.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5255.303,5262.655,"But it wouldn't matter, I should take in the place of the statute, unless as an injunctive order we have no jurisdiction --"
1974.74-156,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5262.655,5267.525,If there is and if there was a three-judge court that was required to be convened then we do and must.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5267.525,5278.852,You have jurisdiction but I thought from the cases there have indications that could if you wanted to refer to the Circuit Court.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5300.661,5307.55,"Now, with that situation is one in which there has no criminal proceeding pending all over this --"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5307.55,5308.579,This raises the question.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5308.579,5311.719,Here you've got an actual criminal proceeding --
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5311.719,5311.87,With a finding --
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5311.87,5313.125,That involves whether Young --
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5313.125,5314.014,With a finding --
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5314.014,5315.796,That's within an exception.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5317.852,5318.581,Exactly.
1974.74-156,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5318.581,5319.657,The harassment exception.
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5319.657,5350.131,"Exactly and in addition with respect to all of what has been said about the adversary proceedings so-called in which they went informed shock to a judge in Orange County, the Superior Court judge who had no jurisdiction, no statutory references, California as this Court well knows has only one way of trying an obscenity case and that's a criminal trial."
1974.74-156,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5402.075,5404.086,"Judge Lydick had a different view at one time, did he not?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5404.086,5406.921,"Yes, but Judge Lydick didn't have before him the evidence."
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5431.991,5446.291,"Mr. Rosenwein, at what stage did your Heller complaint in the federal court turn into an attack on the constitutionality of the California obscenity statute itself?"
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5446.291,5461.801,"Well, when you say that -- well, let me just say this, when we came in, when we came originally before Judge Lydick and asked for temporary restraining order, and by the way at that time they already knew who the plaintiffs were."
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5477.826,5482.694,But when did you first pray for a declaration or injunction as to the unconstitutional --
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5482.694,5483.671,In the complaint.
1974.74-156,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5483.671,5484.915,In your original --
1974.74-156,5,41981,sam_rosenwein,,5484.915,5488.059,Original complaint.
1974.74-156,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5488.059,5488.539,Very well.
1974.74-156,6,37578,oretta_d_sears,,5491.86,5494.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please."
1974.74-156,6,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5642.143,5649.346,"Mrs. Sears you said as I understood you, that you had never appeared before or even seen this three-judge court."
1974.74-156,6,37578,oretta_d_sears,,5649.346,5649.991,That is correct.
1974.74-156,6,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5649.991,5653.489,Did any counsel for Orange County had that privilege?
1974.74-156,6,37578,oretta_d_sears,,5653.489,5654.277,No sir.
1974.74-156,6,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5654.277,5656.371,There was no hearing of any kind nor argument of counsel.
1974.74-156,6,37578,oretta_d_sears,,5656.371,5657.327,No sir.
1974.74-156,6,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5657.327,5659.133,Were the files -- were briefs filed?
1974.74-156,6,37578,oretta_d_sears,,5659.133,5661.918,"Yes, by order of the Court."
1974.74-156,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5686.691,5688.526,Thank you.
