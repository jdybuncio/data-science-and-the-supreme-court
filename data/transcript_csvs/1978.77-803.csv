1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.38,"We'll hear arguments next in 803, Barry against Barchi."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,62.099,65.45,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.328,314.157,"General Hammer, could I just ask one question about when they find the drug -- evidence of drug in the horse and it's presumed that the drug affected the performance of the animal in the race as I understand your rules, does that mean that something is done with the race itself or the results change or is there anything to undo the harmful consequence to the public of the race itself?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,314.157,316.205,"Well, Your Honor, nothing can be done."
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.389,327.81,But is there any discipline against anyone other than the trainer if we held to that finding in that presumption.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,327.81,331.969,The presumption is a rebuttable presumption which relates only to the trainer.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.861,360.211,"I do mean supposing it's a mystery as to what really happened but just from the presumption itself which includes the presumption that performance of the animal was affected by it which of course would affect the owner's record and all the rest of it, nothing happens to anyone except to the trainer as a result of that presumption."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,360.211,361.923,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.923,373.715,"Sometimes you see the inquiry sign go up on the tote board, you know and then it stays on for about 20 minutes or half an hour and then it's replaced by an official sign and they put up the odds."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,376.836,379.042,"Yes, that would be a standard part of the tote board."
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.576,402.147,I think you may have been overbroad.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,421.175,432.593,"Yes, in fact I made that point to Mr. Justice Stevens that this relates where in fact it is found that a third person -- a third party or an outsider whether it would be from another owner --"
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,432.593,438.471,But this is a presumption to get the matter started and that can be rebutted by other evidence.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,438.471,439.539,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.56,446.006,General Hammer can I also clear up one thing.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,457.038,459.025,"No Your Honor, it was not."
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.025,475.195,We'll resume at one o'clock.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,478.731,481.487,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please."
1978.77-803,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,519.839,527.142,But was the purse forfeited here?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,527.142,527.837,"I believe it was, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,527.837,528.941,One can assume that it was.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,528.941,529.9,I think we can so assume.
1978.77-803,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,529.9,532.307,In the law as you said it.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,532.307,538.414,This was not in the case but I would assume that it was forfeited.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.48,625.603,"So I have it in mind, what was imposed here?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,625.603,626.915,A 15-day suspension Your Honor.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.915,628.696,So that was the total punishment.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,628.696,629.583,"That's all, sir."
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.583,631.199,And it was not permanent.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,631.199,631.994,Absolutely not.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.994,637.884,"So by the time there could be any review, the suspension the entire punishment would have been over."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,637.884,639.22,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.22,644.53,Well 15 days is 15 days but -- and you had 30 days.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,646.755,652.55,The statute grants the Board up to 30 days to render its decision.
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,675.567,677.655,Let me go back to your administrative proceedings.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,687.26,692.582,It is our position Your Honor that although the statute itself is somewhat unclear --
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.582,696.775,"So it says -- it says that the suspensions will stay in effect, doesn't it?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,696.775,706.999,"That's what it says, however, in practice and there was an offer of proof on the record, Your Honor, which the District Court did not see fit to take us up on."
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.956,732.741,"Well, I suppose the Board could say -- to tell somebody that we're considering any suspension and just not impose it until there is a hearing."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,732.741,737.088,"Well, in harness racing, this doesn't work that way."
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,751.148,757.561,But the language is rather explicit isn't it that pending such hearing --
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,757.561,757.831,That's true.
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.831,763.935,-- the action suspending a license shall remain in full force and effect and you said that doesn't mean what it says.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,763.935,765.104,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,767.468,770.12,Where does that appear other than you're telling us so?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,770.12,774.751,It appears in the record in the affidavit of John Dailey which appears --
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.751,776.498,Is that in the operative of proof?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,776.498,782.377,"As well as in -- yes and also on the record, the transcript of the hearing --"
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.377,787.599,"So is it just that they regularly disobey the statute, is that it?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,787.599,801.248,Let's put it this way that the statute is construed administratively to in such a way as to achieve substantial justice in meritorious cases.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.248,804.602,"And you're representing the State of New York, I take it."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,804.602,806.132,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,840.726,857.877,"What is the significance of a regulation, a statute or any provision which says one thing and we have assurance that the present people in office won't enforce it."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,860.895,866.715,If it were merely the fact -- an assurance that the present people in office do not enforce --
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.715,872.876,"Well, I don't -- is there anything in there that said what the future people will do?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,872.876,873.435,I think in this case --
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.435,875.019,There's no way --
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,875.019,875.189,In this case --
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,875.189,879.5,There's no way you can predict what a future official do.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,879.5,889.712,Except Your Honor by the established administrative practice of the agency which I think had -- we've been given the opportunity we could have proven as a matter of fact.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,889.712,890.9,Proven what?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,890.9,900.061,That as a matter of well-established administrative interpretation stays was indeed granted.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,900.061,901.678,Always?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,901.678,903.826,As a matter of -- in the discretion of the Board.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,903.826,906.723,"Oh, in the discretion?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,906.723,918.692,When I -- Your Honor apply to this Court for stays of lower court judgments and Your Honor as circuit justice has to exercise discretion.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,921.683,927.742,"I have never -- please, I have never suspended a jockey."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,927.742,929.604,What I'm saying -- no.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.167,941.717,I have the discretionary authority to ignore a statute?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,941.717,943.94,"Not ignore it Your Honor, interpret it."
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.94,949.803,To interpret it and say no when it says yes.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,949.803,950.918,"Well, statutes --"
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.918,952.695,That's larger than the chance to a foot.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,956.367,965.133,"Well, I can only suggest Your Honor that the record as established below indicates that we offer to prove this is a matter of fact."
1978.77-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.133,992.113,"Mr. Hammer, it does seem to me that we do have a problem of New York law here that reading this language that some of my Brother have questioned you about pending such hearing and final determination there on the action the commission refusing to grant or evoking or suspending a license or on imposing a bunch of many full force and effect seems kind of incongruous with the Commission's initial determination."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1000.793,1005.9,It is a conceivably a possible interpretation of the statute.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.345,1015.813,"General Hammer, could I ask you another question about this language."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1032.445,1039.449,The track -- the track judges are the state stewards who make the initial determination.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.333,1042.491,Are they the commission?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1042.491,1042.873,No.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.791,1061.496,"Well, but what I'm suggesting is that there is no inconsistency between the statute and the affidavit because the affidavit talks about staying a penalty imposed by track judges whereas the statute refers to an order that the commission remaining in effect."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1061.496,1062.874,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.874,1067.385,So then we just accept the statute and there is no conflict in the record at all.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1067.385,1069.674,I think that indeed resolves the problem.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.674,1082.756,"Mr. Hammer may I get a question into this particular sentence in the statute has not been construed by your state courts, has it?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1082.756,1089.466,We have the Tafas case which was referred to in the opinion of the three-judge district court.
1978.77-803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1097.152,1103.035,"Well, in your jurisdictional statement, you made an abstention argument based on the Pullman case."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1103.035,1103.983,Right.
1978.77-803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1103.983,1107.066,I see no similar argument in your brief on the merits.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1110.384,1112.061,We have not entirely abandoned it.
1978.77-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.361,1146.584,"Tafas didn't deal with 8022, did it?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1146.584,1153.567,Tafas was a harness licensee and I think Tafas in fact did deal with 8022.
1978.77-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.567,1156.952,"Well, do you think the Pullman issue is before us now?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1156.952,1159.504,I think the issue remains before Your Honors.
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.504,1162.559,Why you don't argue it?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1162.559,1167.891,"Well, it was raised on the jurisdictional statement."
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1181.296,1183.102,Even though you don't press at your --
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1183.102,1186.133,I don't press it vigorously but I do believe it is in the case.
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.133,1197.808,"What happens if the majority of this Court noted it on -- just on the Pullman point because you don't know, do you?"
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1197.808,1198.221,"Well, I --"
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.221,1202.765,I'm talking about alleging something in your jurisdictional statement and then not following it.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1203.919,1207.734,"I think frankly, Your Honor, insofar as following it up."
1978.77-803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.734,1208.034,Yeah.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1208.034,1217.955,"The cases on point Pullman, Carey against Sugar layout a very simple and rather straightforward rule of law."
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.525,1354.059,Are you suggesting that this is analogous to the summary proceedings that are sometimes employed to take a dangerous drug off the market or a medicine or food stuff when it's discovered that it is dangerous that there is a summary suspension and then a hearing.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1354.059,1376.595,I would suggest Mr. Chief Justice that the state interest is in taking a probably -- a licensee was probably misconducted himself off the track is of equal constitutional value and dimension here.
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.265,1380.973,"Well, I'm not making an analogy."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1382.971,1389.196,"Well, I think your inquiry presents the proper analogy."
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.719,1438.691,What -- under what Section did the steward issues a suspension?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1438.691,1439.245,The steward --
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.245,1442.024,I mean what authorized him to issue the suspension?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1442.024,1457.419,"The steward suspended the license under the racing regulations that is found in Title IX of the New York Codes, Rules And Regulations which is the state analog to the CFR and it's reprinted and --"
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.419,1459.059,But who issued the regulations?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1459.059,1460.804,The Racing and Wagering Board.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.804,1462.315,So is that the Commission?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1462.315,1465.498,The steward is the agent of the Board.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.498,1466.414,Is that the Commission?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1467.173,1467.94,Yes.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.94,1471.853,"Is that -- in Section 8022, it refers to a racing commission."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1471.853,1472.778,Right.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.778,1473.442,That's the Board?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1473.442,1474.178,That's correct because --
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.178,1475.672,And they'd issued regulations?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1475.672,1478.843,The harness racing commission was subsumed under the state racing --
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.843,1482.397,And their stewards are their agents authorized to make the suspensions?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1482.397,1484.124,Yes sir.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.124,1488.749,So the suspension in effect was issued by the Commission here?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1488.749,1497.641,It was issued by an authorized agent of the Commission subject to review at the request of the licensee by the full Commission or full Board.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.641,1500.518,Thank you.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.518,1503.461,I'm not sure you completed your answer to Justice White.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1507.24,1529.11,"The suspension was authorized -- it was for violation of Sections 4116.11, 4120.05 and 4120.6 of the Rules of harness racing and they're reprinted at --"
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.11,1529.78,On page 5a.--
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1529.78,1531.554,at 5a of our jurisdictional state.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.554,1541.444,But none of those Sections refer to suspension of a trainer.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1541.444,1555.055,There is an earlier Section of the racing rules which authorized suspension for violation of these other rules.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.179,1563.532,But is there a standard set forth in that earlier regulation of when there shall be a suspension?
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1568.16,1570.13,This is within the discretion of the steward.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1570.13,1571.916,I see.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.916,1574.364,"So, do you have the Section?"
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.364,1576.432,No.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.179,1589.119,Now that gives -- I take it that that refers to the Board or the Commission.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1589.119,1598.697,It refers to the judges of the -- who have been appointed by the Racing and Wagering Board.
1978.77-803,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1598.697,1600.57,I gather that it's not printed anywhere here.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1600.57,1600.843,No sir.
1978.77-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.843,1601.517,"Well, that's alright."
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.218,1609.813,Just to make one point clear.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1620.509,1626.955,We contend that this is a rule which is enforced as a matter of discretion.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.955,1628.701,Thank you.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1628.701,1647.508,That while the trainer's responsibility rules are rules of law in practice and this was our intention before the three-judge court which appears in the transcript which is filed with Your Honors that the stewards nevertheless have discretion in enforcing it.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.508,1662.749,"Does that mean to put it bluntly that if the track judges or the commissioners have decided to believe the lie detector results and thought this man was totally innocent, they could have not suspended him without violating any state law they could have had."
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1662.749,1665.366,That's correct.
1978.77-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.366,1669.039,But then does the record that tells us why they did suspend them.
1978.77-803,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1669.039,1672.579,The record does not so show.
1978.77-803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.014,1841.036,"Alright, very well."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,1844.793,1849.599,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.761,1969.485,You say that he took a polygraph exam.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,1975.273,1983.596,I believe that they are part of the appendix in this case -- he was asked to whether or not he had given Lasix to this horse.
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.942,2007.874,"If the Commission believed him as to all those answers, would that make Rule 4120.6 the trainer's responsibility rule inapplicable to him?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2007.874,2015.93,"The way it has been interpreted by the New York State Racing and Wagering Board and some of the jurisdictions around the nation, the answer to that is no."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.213,2028.427,Didn't the District Court which generally ruled in your favor say that that was a proper rule?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2028.427,2032.773,They said that it was a rebuttable presumption or at least some of them were rebuttable.
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.516,2071.533,Did you ask for it in an administrative hearing?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2071.533,2073.422,"It's never given, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2074.386,2076.071,Did you ask for it?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2076.071,2077.157,"No, we did not ask for it."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.157,2079.927,"Well then you can't complain about not getting it, can you?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2079.927,2087.543,"Well, we're not aware of the fact that they were going to suspend my client without any type of a hearing whatsoever at that point in time."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.67,2105.548,"But going into an administrative hearing, you would have been able to challenge that right away, would you not?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2105.548,2106.57,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.362,2135.529,Did you say that various -- very rapidly that how are we to know now but if you would ask for the administrative hearing that the statute provides for that you might not had your man cleared then there never would have been any lawsuit.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2135.529,2144.416,"Well, Your Honor, since I stop grooming horses and became a lawyer, I've never seen one instance where a stay was granted by this Board."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2238.864,2254.654,"I'm not sure what that has to do with this case but let me ask you another question, neither of you as far as I observe have cited the case of Securities and Exchange Commission against Sloan which was decided in this Court in May of this year."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2279.369,2283.366,"Well, not having the case before me Your Honor, it makes it pretty difficult."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2296.959,2304.095,"-- suspended from training for 10 days, that's quite of a loss tp him, isn't it, in the stock market?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2304.095,2316.824,"Yes, I would agree but this bears upon an individual's right to earn a livelihood in the horse racing business as soon as you are suspended as the trainer, the owner automatically loses the purse."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.896,2340.483,-- his refusal to ask for a hearing.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2340.483,2341.495,Excuse me.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.495,2345.287,Isn't a part of that his refusal to ask for a hearing?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2345.287,2348.031,I would agree with that if the hearing were meaningful.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.031,2352.941,"All of this that is going to happen to the rest of his life, he could have --"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2352.941,2366.224,"But Your Honor, if he did ask for the hearing without a provision for a stay given to harness racing licensees while there is one given to thoroughbred racing licensees, then the hearing is meaningless at that point in time."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.224,2367.224,Help me with this.(Voice Overlap)
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.224,2368.166,15 days.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2370.792,2374.98,"That is correct but during that period of time, Your Honor, these horses --"
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.98,2380.381,"I understand that but after the 15 days expired, he is free to practice this free trade again."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2380.381,2401.37,"Yes he is but during the 15 days, he loses all the owners whose horses have to race during that 15-day period because so long as they employ him as trainer, their horses will not race so he cannot earn a portion of the purse which the trainer gets and once those horses are given to another trainer, it would be like an attorney suspended from the practice of law."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.609,2414.117,"But if you want to stay, you're going to have some sort of hearings on the stay aren't you?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2414.117,2415.78,A hearing on the issue of the stay?
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.78,2416.481,Yes.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2428.677,2439.741,I'm saying that parallel to Section 401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act that there certainly are instances where stays do not have to be given in emergency situation.
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.741,2451.829,"If there are instances where stays don't have to be given, then there must be some sort of a hearing that the commission would have to hold to decide whether your clients is one of those instances or not."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2456.747,2458.562,"Yeah, I would believe so, yes."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.562,2461.014,But you just say 15 is too many.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2461.014,2466.065,"Well, 15 of course is an irremediable loss to the trainer."
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.065,2468.943,How about 10 -- 10 days?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2468.943,2478.985,10 days will probably work -- 10 days would probably not work as great a detriment but it would come very close because these horses race once a week.
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.346,2482.561,What you're really --
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2482.561,2483.967,-- Your Honors will not tolerate it.
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.967,2489.773,What's you're really arguing is that there can't be any suspension by a summary process.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2489.773,2509.197,I'm arguing that from the decision in this case below and from the due process decisions of this Court before where there is no ability for retroactive payments where there is not something that can be restored by a post-termination hearing.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.546,2553.28,What do you think the standard would be in a hearing -- in a pre-suspension hearing or hearing within 48 hours of the suspension?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2563.598,2569.347,"Yeah, I think there would be a question of probable cause to believe sir at the very minimum, yes."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.347,2570.4,"But that would satisfy, do you think?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2570.4,2575.684,I think at the very minimum but I think that in view of the type of injury that is caused --
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.684,2586.647,"Well, I know but in Bell against Burson, probable cause to believe that you've -- that fall to an accident, you lose your driver's license, you may lose your job because you can't get there."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2586.647,2602.602,Yes but under the presumptions if the Court accepts the presumptions as a rebuttable presumptions then the probably cause that something was found in the same would end the entire case.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.37,2611.624,Well suppose it showed that he was in the hospital for the past three days?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2611.624,2620.1,"Under the terms of the rule as interpreted by New York and some other jurisdictions, he would be suspended no matter where he was, no matter what he had to do with it."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2620.1,2624.096,At least he could show that at the hearing.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2624.096,2635.742,"Well, so long as -- yes, he could show that at a hearing but so long as he was the trainer of the horse he again would be suspended under the interpretation of this statute."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.647,2677.1,What have the state courts responded to those arguments?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2677.1,2686.987,"In some instances, the state courts have gone along with the argument of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board and refuse to grant any stays."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.987,2688.621,What about in the other instance?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2688.621,2693.51,"In the instances of thoroughbred racing, the stays are commonly granted in New York."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.266,2762.815,Did they have the result of overturning the decision of the Appellate Division?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2762.815,2775.447,"No, the Appellate Division which went in the same vane as Barchi and the three-judge court below was sustained by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York on the dismissal of this appeal of Gerard v. Barry."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.447,2777.326,Was that a construction of the statute?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2777.326,2788.105,"That was a construction of a statute which has come into existence paralleling the decision of Barchi, Section 401(3) of the State Administrative Procedure Act."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.336,2795.87,So 8022 is no longer in effect?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2795.87,2797.126,Excuse me?
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.126,2799.97,Does the statute involved here is no longer in effect?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2799.97,2803.355,"No, the statute has not been changed by the New York State Legislature."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.355,2803.763,I see.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2803.763,2818.363,But Section 401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act which gives the same kind of guarantees that the three-judge constitutional court gave to these licensees has now been the law and has now been made the law in the State of New York.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.363,2829.44,Would you suggest it would be unconstitutional of New York simply made trainers liable for the condition of the horse and suspended them without proof of fault?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2829.44,2833.758,I believe that in each situation where --
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.758,2847.117,"If a trainer has custody of the horse, the state says if the horse has its proof to have drugs in it, that's the end of the matter, that's the trainer's responsibility."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2847.117,2852.575,I think that you have made one assumption in your statement and that is if the trainer had control of the horse.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.575,2853.042,Yes.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2853.042,2857.004,"Had the trainer the exclusive care custody in control of the horse, I have no objection for that."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.004,2860.039,Or if the state made in responsible for the exclusive care and custody.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2860.039,2864.589,"Well, by legislative field, I don't think that they could deprive him of his constitutional rights."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.947,2879.322,"Of course, I understand that the District Court, it didn't say the presumptions were irrebuttable, it said they were rebuttable."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2879.322,2880.813,"Yes, I believe --"
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.813,2886.68,"Which means that it turns on some kind of fault doesn't it, rather than some absolute liability?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2886.68,2896.83,Yes it does but I think that the Section that the court below was taking into consideration was the one that says that the trainer is responsibility and must guide and care for his horse.
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.413,2944.979,"Mr. Faraldo, my home State of Arizona has a statute that makes the registered owner of an automobile liable for damage caused by anyone operating it unless it's actually stolen and you don't have to show that he loaned it to anybody, you don't have to show that he had anything to do with the operation of it or knowledge of it."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2955.084,2963.998,"Well, I think that that has been -- I think that that has dictated to us by insurance considerations and other considerations."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.277,2968.011,Well --
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2968.011,2970.978,-- unless Arizona has something other than mandatory insurance.
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.978,2982.666,"Well, Arizona is bombed by the United States Constitution the same way New York is and the same way the District Court that the same Constitution that the District Court was interpreting in this case."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,2989.457,2995.057,"No, I do not because I do not see a rational connection with the fact of his control."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3055.382,3060.98,"We're dealing with dumping of horses, how would you handle it to prevent it?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3060.98,3071.972,"Well, I think that the state of the scientific art in the horse racing and chemistry is sufficient enough to place the time of administration within fixed parameters."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.531,3094.531,He had to prove that he administered the drug?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3094.531,3096.699,"No, I think that on that basis, you would --"
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3096.699,3097.811,Because I have never heard of it --
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3097.811,3098.412,No.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.412,3100.678,-- out in the public to do with that.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3101.38,3111.436,I think what you would have to prove is that the drug was apparently administered during a period of time when he had control and/or custody of the horse.
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.436,3117.326,"Well, we can't review -- we are not here to review the medical question counsel."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3134.737,3137.547,No but the assumption as far as questions --
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3137.547,3139.532,"I'm sorry Mr. Faraldo, I ask you the question."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3143.699,3153.632,The presumption so far as it puts the liability from the mere finding of the substance in the horse's urine I think is part of the case.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.698,3197.387,"They gave you a couple of test or at least one and as far as we know, they investigate it."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3197.387,3201.045,"And as far as I know, they did absolutely nothing."
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.372,3219.6,"How did you know -- so what you say you pass the exam, what did they say to you, anything?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3219.6,3225.737,They said we pass the exam and if they knew we had nothing to do with it but they insisted on suspending us anyway.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.841,3232.101,"Is that the part of the record, what they said to you at the time."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3232.101,3246.304,"Well, in the affidavit of Mr. Dailey which has been alluded to before, there is a statement that when it was not able to be determined who was responsible for this incident, Mr. Barchi was suspended under the basis of the trainers responsibility role."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3252.293,3259.38,"Mr. Faraldo, I'm not sure I'm clear about this change in the New York procedure, what do you call it?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3259.38,3261.514,The State Administrative Procedure Act sir.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3261.514,3267.932,"Now what's the effect of that -- does that mean in the future, 8022 suspensions must be proceeded by a hearing?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3267.932,3270.928,"Well, what -- yes sir that is an essence to what it means."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.046,3287.628,"Well, help me out this way, suppose that law -- that moment have been in effect when all these happened, what would Mr. Barchi have gotten?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3287.628,3291.686,Mr. Barchi would have got a full judicatory hearing prior to the taking.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3291.686,3293.114,When would that have been --
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3293.114,3293.339,That would have been --
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3293.339,3295.482,In the context of this case.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3295.482,3298.52,"Well, I don't quite understand."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3298.52,3303.382,"It would have been before -- there was an 18-day period of investigation before the suspension, wasn't there?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3303.382,3303.837,Yes.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3303.837,3309.061,"Now, and what would have happened if that amendment had been in effect in this case?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3309.061,3312.978,"Well, Mr. Barchi would have been given notice of charges and an opportunity to respond --"
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.978,3315.434,Some time in that 18-day period I take it though.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3315.434,3316.276,Yes sir.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.276,3317.944,Before there was any suspension?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3317.944,3318.003,Yes sir.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3318.003,3320.11,There would have been a full judicatory hearing?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3320.11,3325.96,That is correct as which is now provided for now but only post termination.
1978.77-803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.06,3330.749,Unless they make a finding.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3330.749,3339.399,Unless they make a finding that the public welfare safety or health is in jeopardy by continuing the license of that individual.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3339.399,3341.683,A finding based on what?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3341.683,3344.488,That is a question that has not been answered by the New York State Court.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3344.488,3350.01,"This finding that I gather, the commission could make without giving you any hearing."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3350.01,3358.628,"Well, if they could substantiate that then in a court action for a violation under Section 401(3) of the State Administrative Procedure law, I would agree with that, yes sir."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3358.628,3365.199,And all that you ask for here was a declaratory judgment that the then the existing New York procedures were you know unconstitutional?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3365.199,3371.692,On the grounds of due process and on the grounds of violating the equal protection of law and I would like to address myself to that issue.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3459.948,3470.084,"Well, is it there are some suggestions though that has been corruption around harness racing that is not been through of thoroughbred racing?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3470.084,3483.772,"The statement made by the attorney general is that in 1954, there were some labor union disruptions or activities at Yonkers Raceway I believe it was or in harness racing in the State of New York."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3532.066,3535.228,"Your statutes did develop separately, didn't they?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3535.228,3574.972,"Yes they did and as a matter of fact, the state investigation commission in June of 1976 noted that there were procedural differences which did not have any rational basis and that once the State Racing and Wagering Board was consolidated, in other words, once the harness racing commission and thoroughbred commission were brought under one roof that the New York State Racing and Wagering Board ought to work to alleviate those reference where they appear but there is no factual, there is no factual basis for treating the harness racing personnel different than thoroughbred racing personnel."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3577.945,3582.411,"I suppose the equal protection doesn't demand identity, does it all the way through."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3584.445,3594.299,"Yes, I would agree with that."
1978.77-803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.299,3599.788,You don't agree that thoroughbred racing can be distinguished because it's for the improvement of the breed?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3599.788,3600.186,No.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3607.774,3614.561,"Well, why don't you do something to breakdown the inference that harness racing horses aren't thoroughbreds?"
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3614.561,3617.734,"Excuse me, breakdown the inference that harness racing horses are not thoroughbreds?"
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3617.734,3619.496,Are not thoroughbreds.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3619.496,3621.149,"Well, they are not thoroughbreds."
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3621.149,3621.281,Why not?
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3621.281,3622.89,They are different breed altogether.
1978.77-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3629.3,3634.546,I thought a thoroughbred mentioned knew your mom and your papa.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.546,3636.867,I'm a little curiuos.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3642.507,3644.055,In respect to what sir?
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3644.055,3646.679,To the racing that declined.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3648.129,3652.021,The Hambletonian is a Du Quoin and it's under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Racing Board.
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3652.021,3652.659,"Well, I'm asking."
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3658.296,3659.107,"Well, they do not."
1978.77-803,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3690.942,3694.381,I think that your New York trainers go to Illinois for the Hambletonian.
1978.77-803,1,30378,joseph_a_faraldo,,3694.381,3696.522,Yes we do.
1978.77-803,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3697.89,3698.212,Thank you.
1978.77-803,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3701.935,3704.626,"Mr. Attorney General, before you start."
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3742.642,3744.616,I would disagree with that Mr. Justice Powell.
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3744.616,3748.155,Have I stated his position correctly?
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3748.155,3755.473,I believe you have stated counsel's position correctly but I believe he has misconstrued what the New York Court of Appeals did.
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3767.918,3769.328,The Appellate Division.
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3769.328,3770.26,That's correct.
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3770.26,3772.712,What did the New York Court of Appeals say?
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3772.712,3778.427,The New York Court of Appeals were on purely procedural grounds unrelated to the substance of the statute.
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3778.427,3781.932,Does the opinion make that clear?
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3781.932,3786.733,All you have are single orders without any opinion whatever.
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3786.733,3789.111,But does the order make that clear?
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3789.111,3794.139,"As a matter of New York jurisprudence, any New York lawyer would understand this that --"
1978.77-803,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3794.139,3797.492,What about us?
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3797.492,3803.536,I think it would be clear from the examination of the New York statutes.
1978.77-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3823.434,3836.425,"Mr. General Hammer, would it be true that the decision of the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court was consistent with Mr. Justice Powell's understanding of New York law or suggested understanding?"
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3836.425,3836.911,No sir.
1978.77-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3864.712,3869.457,And that would be your view even if the Appellate Division decision had been by the Court of Appeals rather than the Appellate Division.
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3869.457,3875.437,"Well, if the Court of Appeals -- if it had been the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals is the last word on New York law --"
1978.77-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3875.437,3876.098,I understand that but --
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3876.098,3877.207,-- but this was not.
1978.77-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3877.207,3881.466,But you're saying the opinion itself doesn't hold what counsel said it holds.
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3881.466,3894.58,The opinion counsel is correct in his summarization of what the appellate division held but this is not we submit what New York law is or should be and this will have --
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3894.58,3896.924,Because the Appellate Division is not the Court a last resort.
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3896.924,3898.139,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-803,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3898.139,3902.73,"But it is the court, the highest court of the State of New York which spoke into this issue of state law."
1978.77-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3902.73,3903.646,That is correct.
1978.77-803,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3903.646,3909.324,"Well, is it also because the appellate division case did not involve a drugged horse?"
1978.77-803,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3909.324,3926.492,"In this case, the appellate division involved the so-called the Gerstein case switching where the veterinarian was ultimately convicted on some violations and in fact sentenced to prison for a year."
1978.77-803,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3962.439,3963.093,Thank you gentlemen.
