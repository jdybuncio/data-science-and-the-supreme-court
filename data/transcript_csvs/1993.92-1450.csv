1993.92-1450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.678,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1450, Cynthia Waters v. Cheryl Churchill."
1993.92-1450,0,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,11.11,13.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1450,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.398,120.26,"Mr. Manson, do you mean no evidence on the record as it now stands?"
1993.92-1450,0,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,139.004,141.077,Your Honor... I'm sorry.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1026.023,1038.551,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1450,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.53,1085.863,"Mount Healthy was a case in which the contest was a contest as between motivations, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1085.863,1091.697,"Yes, Mount Healthy was most accurately characterized as a mixed-motive case."
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.385,1103.645,I don't understand that.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1106.75,1111.432,Well... and it's exactly in this respect that we think the court of appeals was wrong.
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.685,1122.157,"Well, I don't... then I don't understand why your response is... Mount Healthy still, mixed motive or not, is right on point."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1122.157,1122.417,I think--
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.417,1127.532,That... why would mixed motive make a difference if what your real motive is doesn't make a difference?
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1127.532,1131.834,"--Motive clearly is relevant, and Mount Healthy establishes that much."
1993.92-1450,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1131.834,1148.767,"Well, couldn't... couldn't it make a difference if, in fact, there... there would be a compete... there was a competing justification, and the question is whether that justification was the operative one, as opposed to a justification of retaliation against protected speech."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1148.767,1150.056,Yes.
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.376,1164.846,I still... I still don't understand... I still don't understand that.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1171.892,1174.543,--That's right.
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.543,1184.15,"And the assertion was, well, there may have been mixed motives and... but, still, doesn't it assume that you have to prove the bad motive?"
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1184.15,1184.86,Yes.
1993.92-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.275,1196.018,"Yes, but the... there was something independent of the speech."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1206.185,1207.517,That's correct.
1993.92-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.517,1208.827,She did have a bad personnel record.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1223.888,1229.601,It may be more accurate to say that she was fired based on the reports of what she had said.
1993.92-1450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.275,1235.935,"Well, but the speech is the... is... was the basis for the discharge."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1235.935,1237.267,That's correct.
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.267,1237.998,And--
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1263.344,1264.924,That is what this case is about.
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1269.588,1276.032,"And if the employer was right about what the speech was, there wouldn't be any First Amendment argument to make."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1276.032,1277.923,"--That's right, if the--"
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.923,1285.139,"It's only because the employer thought the words were one thing, when, in fact, it appears they may have been something quite different."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1285.139,1286.157,--Exactly.
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1301.529,1305.101,I had a question that I think you could be very helpful with.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1316.438,1333.542,"The situation in Federal employment is generally that whether the employee is a probationary employee or a nonprobationary employee, she would have the opportunity to get notice of the reason why she was being discharged, and in certain circumstances an opportunity to respond."
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.476,1342.808,Take a nonprobationary employee.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1346.238,1347.18,--Yes.
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.972,1370.444,"Could you come directly to court, skip over that?"
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1370.444,1377.399,"We would argue no, that, in fact, the employee has a duty to exhaust his or her administrative remedies first."
1993.92-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.406,1397.482,Do any of these matters go through a collectively bargained arrangement?
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1397.482,1398.794,Yes.
1993.92-1450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.963,1417.555,"Mr. Seamon, your time is about to expire, and I did want to ask a question, please."
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1432.117,1432.735,That's correct.
1993.92-1450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1432.735,1433.947,By any version of the facts.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1450.577,1462.115,"We think... we think that summary judgment was appropriate, and that's because there was no dispute about what the employer... what the hospital knew and why it fired Nurse Churchill."
1993.92-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.978,1497.699,Yes.
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1516.861,1518.922,"It certainly should not, in our view."
1993.92-1450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.017,1543.599,Is that a question... mixed question of fact in law?
1993.92-1450,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1548.873,1552.125,I think that would probably be a mixed question.
1993.92-1450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.653,1613.025,"Thank you, Mr Seamon."
1993.92-1450,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1615.015,1621.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1450,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.655,1698.912,"Mr. Bisbee, I wish you would turn to the question presented, which is that the understanding of the employer at the time of the action."
1993.92-1450,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1735.115,1737.238,"--The petitioners raised that question, Your Honor."
1993.92-1450,3,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,3378.784,3388.361,"I would strongly urge this Court that this matter should not be sent back on remand, but in fact that summary judgment was appropriate in this case."
1993.92-1450,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3421.222,3423.914,Did the district court find that there was a reasonable belief on the part of the employer?
1993.92-1450,3,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,3423.914,3426.506,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1993.92-1450,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.347,3432.38,"Where did... it said that explicitly, that the belief was reasonable?"
1993.92-1450,3,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,3432.38,3455.096,"--The district court held, Your Honor, that under either version of the... of the case, that the point of the speech, the employee's point of the speech... because Cheryl Churchill admitted, in addition to her... in her version of the speech, that she talked about nonprotected items, namely her evaluation and her thoughts concerning the manager of that unit."
1993.92-1450,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.557,3502.48,Thank you.
1993.92-1450,3,34870,lawrence_a_manson,,3502.48,3502.938,--I thank the Court.
1993.92-1450,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3502.938,3504.3,"Thank you, Mr. Manson."
