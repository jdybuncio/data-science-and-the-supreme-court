1988.88-309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We'll near argument now in No. 88-309, the State of Wyoming v. the United States."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,9.356,9.672,Thank you.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,49.031,58.67,"Well, suppose... suppose there hadn't been the state rights... state water reservation rights, is your claim still that the standard was misapplied?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,58.67,59.039,"--Yes, sir."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,59.039,59.389,Yes?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,59.389,60.055,It is.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,60.055,60.889,Okay.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,60.889,76.381,"And the more general question that is before the Court, and the one that has drawn so much attention from the amici is the applicability, the universal applicability of the PIA quantification... standard to all reservations other than those in Arizona I."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.591,197.01,Mr. White--
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,197.01,197.493,"--Yes, ma'am."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.493,211.936,"--is it the fact that before 1915 that the Federal Government had obtained protective state water permits sufficient to irrigate 145,000 acres?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,211.936,212.603,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.837,250.561,"The acreage found to be practicably irrigable in this litigation by the Wyoming Supreme Court was 108,000 acres?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,251.628,252.695,"It is close to that... it makes no difference, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.547,260.466,"The state had apparently even agreed that it was 102,000."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,260.466,265.904,"--We agreed... we have asserted, Your Honor, when the litigation began that there were 102,000--"
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.904,266.287,Un-huh.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,266.287,270.022,--but we used that with a different quantification rate and a different priority date.
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.022,274.426,But applying the practical... the practicably... it's hard to say?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,274.426,274.776,You're right.
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.776,282.164,"--irrigable standard, the state had agreed it was at least 102,000?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,282.164,286.484,"With a different amount of water and a different priority date, that's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.314,309.016,Marked ceded land?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,309.016,311.885,"Yes, sir, they are."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.703,397.824,"But not enough to irrigate the 145,000 acres, I take it?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,397.824,398.391,--That's right.
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.821,426.159,"I suppose the Federal Government says, though, that it relinquished those after the Winters Doctrine had been established."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,430.295,432.812,"Well, I'm sure that's what you will be told, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.392,455.694,Mr. White why... why did they relinquish?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,455.694,457.196,--I'm sorry?
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.196,459.263,Why did they relinquish these state rights?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,459.263,469.587,"Apparently they didn't need them, Your Honor, and the suggestion is made that the state cancelled these rights simply because the United States didn't come in and renew them."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.311,511.08,Is that in Idaho?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,511.08,513.013,"--Yes, sir, it is in Idaho."
1988.88-309,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.452,590.013,"Mr. White, there is some suggestion in the briefs somewhere in this case that with some additional storage of water that the full exercise by the tribes of their rights to the 108,000 acres would have no adverse effect on existing users."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,591.798,602.84,"That was the... the conclusion of the master, and it was the decision at the first district court judge that heard the case."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.91,878.848,There was some... I take it if... historically how many acres had been irrigated?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,878.848,881.217,"--Historically about 54,000."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.217,882.35,"About 54,000?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,892.59,898.244,"Well, of courser it's evidence of need, Your Honor, but it's not a question of whether... of need unsatisfied."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.279,901.629,All right.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,901.629,901.964,--that Congress--
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.964,904.833,So you say there is no evidence of any need that hasn't been satisfied?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,904.833,905.333,--That's correct.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.333,905.733,All right.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,905.733,906.733,I'm sorry.
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.306,970.858,"General White, can I ask about your need point?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,982.25,983.383,"Fifty... about 54,000--"
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.383,983.816,Yes.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,983.816,984.552,--have been historically irrigated.
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.552,1000.227,"But, you know, 20 years from now if it turns out that they can prove that they want to farm more than that but can't do it because of lack of water, then is the 1868 grant automatically increased?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1002.061,1007.031,I think you measure the need based on Congress' intent at the time of the initial Reservation.
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.681,1009.567,"So, the 54,000 is irrelevant."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1013.102,1016.054,"--Well, I agree that 54,000 is irrelevant, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.108,1049.56,Uh-huh.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1049.56,1051.094,--would ever be needed to be irrigated.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.654,1074.093,And I suppose the PIA standard just assumes that you're allotting water for irrigation?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1074.093,1074.476,"Well, it does--"
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.476,1075.16,For agriculture.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1075.16,1076.712,--It does assume that you're only--
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.185,1095.356,"Well, it certainly... it certainly doesn't measure the... the water needs for any other purpose."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1095.356,1096.006,That's correct.
1988.88-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1102.36,1119.621,"But as I understand... as I understand Justice Scalia's question and your answer, you would fix in this decree for all time the amount of water to which the Indians are entitled based on your present understanding of congressional intent?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1119.621,1122.173,"--We would fix it based on what Congress said, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1129.262,1133.898,"And that would, so far as you're concerned, be a binding adjudication for all time?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1133.898,1139.035,"If this Court defers to express congressional intent, it would be."
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.524,1152.526,"Well, let's just assume, though, that it was just an ordinary case like in Arizona."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1159.199,1159.699,--That's correct.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.999,1163.067,"And it's not about to be changed, I don't suppose."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1163.067,1163.833,It never will be.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.833,1167.554,"If the Indians need more water, why, the United States will have to condemn it."
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1167.554,1173.541,Either that or make a new appropriation or a new reservation.
1988.88-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.743,1189.151,"Well, I... the only further question I have is, what, then, is the relevance of what happens after 1905 if we're trying to determine the intent as of 1905?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1189.151,1194.872,"--Where you're really trying to determine intent... as of 1868, as of the date of the treaty."
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.692,1233.828,What does the 1905 Act have to do with what Congress intended in 1868?
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1237.547,1240.916,"Well, it has absolutely nothing to do with what Congress intended in 1868."
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.916,1252.141,"--So, if Congress intended more in 1868, if it intended enough water for all the practicably irrigable acreage, Congress, by passing the 1905 Act was what?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1256.093,1274.988,"Once the 1905 Act came along, it occurs to me, Your Honor, that it doesn't make any difference what Congress' intent was in 19... or, excuse me... 1868, unless it was Congress' intent to reserve more water than that for which state awarded water rights were obtained in 1905."
1988.88-309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.988,1278.458,"Well, can they just take away the water rights they had given in 1868?"
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1278.824,1285.462,They do it all the time under this... as early as 1896 in a case involving this particular Reservation.
1988.88-309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.051,1305.209,--They also relinquished most of the... an awful lot of the water rights... state water rights that were obtained for the reservation.
1988.88-309,0,36853,michael_douglas_white,,1305.209,1305.776,That's true.
1988.88-309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.215,1316.282,"Very well, Mr. White."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1326.789,1329.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.403,1402.087,"Well, why... why is that such a natural conclusion?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1412.645,1413.128,Not here--
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.128,1418.715,But not all the water and then whatever is left over can be used for everybody else.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1418.715,1423.769,"--Well, Justice Scalla, I think your... your concern really was answered in Winters in 1908."
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.34,1432.459,"Oh, yeah, I'm not questioning the reservation of the right."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1455.324,1457.107,Pardon?
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.107,1457.69,"These people are not selling water, are they?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1457.69,1460.359,"I don't... no, they're not selling water to my... It's not my understanding."
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.359,1462.644,Haven't they sold water in the past?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1462.644,1464.18,I don't believe that's... that's true.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.471,1481.356,Are they using all the water that's been al located in this proceeding?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1481.356,1483.057,"--At present, no they're not using all the water."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.057,1484.057,"Well, what's happening to it?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1484.057,1486.526,It's flowing downstream and being used by non-Indians.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.526,1490.83,"Well, have they... have they attempted to obstruct the flow or, down the stream?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1490.83,1497.317,"I don't... I believe that last year... and, again, I think the tribes' representative is probably more knowledgeable on this point than I am."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.888,1504.188,What were they going to use it for?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1504.188,1505.757,I believe it was for irrigation purposes.
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.642,1513.194,Didn't they receive a payment from the state not to assert those rights?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1513.194,1516.379,"Again, this... this is all outside the record, first of all."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.425,1578.869,"Mr. Minear, in calculating what's practicably irrigable, is it necessary to take into the calculus whether additional irrigation projects are reasonably likely to be constructed to make it possible?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1578.869,1584.456,In terms of... are you talking about irrigation projects constructed by the Indians to put their water to use or--
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.456,1585.84,Or the Federal Government--
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1585.84,1586.173,--In--
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.173,1586.858,--on their behalf?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1586.858,1592.027,"--In planning future projects what the government, does, it goes through, as the first step--"
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.027,1592.379,No.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1596.581,1597.098,--Yes.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.098,1606.369,Does one have to take into the calculus whether any of these projects to make it irrigable will be constructed?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1606.369,1607.055,Yes.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.809,1618.127,That could be run.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1624.648,1626.517,They would exceed Bureau of Reclamation standards.
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.856,1668.408,What would these projects do?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1674.212,1680.116,Essentially what they would do is they would increase the water supply to land that is practicably irrigable.
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.738,1693.274,"Now, does this mean that Indians would be farming it or that the Indians would lease it to other people?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1693.274,1695.959,I think the tripes' plans are that the Indians would farm it.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.344,1712.253,Does the calculus of the practicably irrigable land depend in anyway on whether the tribes intend to farm it themselves or intend to sell off the rights they obtain?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1712.253,1716.205,I think it does depend on the fact that the tribes will sell it themselves.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.241,1717.891,That what?

1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1724.228,1724.795,And use it--
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.795,1725.661,--rather than sell it off?

1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1726.93,1731.049,"And is that, in your view, part of the necessary calculus?"

1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1740.755,1745.241,"--If that is one of the premises of the standard, then, of course, that is going to be a factor in the economic analysis here."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.241,1745.792,Is that a premise--
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1745.792,1746.275,If that was a premise.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.275,1747.01,--of the standard?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1747.01,1749.226,"Yes, I believe that it was a premise of the standard here."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1752.747,1755.247,And you agree that it should be part of the standard?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1755.247,1756.949,"Yes, I think that that seems appropriate."
1988.88-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1756.949,1761.001,And as of what date is the standard or the projection made?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1764.972,1770.19,"The standard is based on 1980 projections, in large part by agreement by all the parties."

1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1860.484,1864.819,"--or, the tribes, in fact, are growing alfalfa and small grains."

1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1905.228,1905.545,What--
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1905.545,1907.764,--in the early part of the century?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1907.764,1909.864,--There's two critical periods where this occurred.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.357,1924.892,"Well, you allowed some to... to lapse."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1924.892,1926.809,--In 1963 after Arizona I.
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.113,1962.732,"Can you, under wyoming law, retain a right that long?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1964.684,1970.855,It's... It's my understanding that one simply needs to file an extension and they can extend it every five years or so.
1988.88-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1974.54,1976.925,"Now, you had three reasons to use current technology."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1980.813,1985.515,The third reason is I think that this is consistent with what Congress probably intended back in 1868.
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.386,2046.005,Arizona I contains virtually no reasoning.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2046.005,2052.574,I think that it odes contain the core kernel of reasoning that's important to the... the determination of a water right.

1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2067.699,2072.62,"But the discussion took place in the Special Master's Report, which, In fact, that's appended to our brief."
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2072.62,2079.289,"Yeah, but ordinarily we don't consider the report of a Special Master as someone incorporated by reference into the Court's opinion."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2079.289,2083.592,"On the other hand, the statement in the opinion in Arizona I was that we agreed with the Special Masters report."
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.043,2085.795,"Well, about those--"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2085.795,2086.411,Pardon?
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.411,2087.712,--About those reservations.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2087.712,2089.164,About those particular reservations.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.65,2099.52,"Well, there's no history about those reservations in Arizona I, like there is here in Wyoming."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2099.52,2099.987,That's right.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.572,2103.189,"Well, you could say--"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2103.189,2104.391,--With respect to the agricultural--
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.391,2105.874,--they are different reservations.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2105.874,2106.376,--But the--
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.376,2107.509,They're not the same reservations.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2108.493,2113.946,"--They... they might be different reservations, but the agricultural purpose of these reservations is even more clear than those Executive Order ones."
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.946,2121.552,"But it was also... this... this reservation was Intended for particular tribes, Shoshone and later another tribe was added."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2122.852,2127.456,"The treaty itself indicates, thought that At was for other tribes that might be settled amongst them."
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.86,2139.847,"--Well, in Arizona it was clear that it was... It was not for any particular tribe or others that might settle amongst them."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2170.616,2171.116,"Well, I think--"
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.116,2171.918,--in agricultural products or--
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2171.918,2176.87,--the idea that these tribes would become very rich oft of this grant of water is simply a fantasy.
1988.88-309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.87,2184.959,"--Well, I thought... I thought that the purpose of the... of the agricultural grant was to enable them to grow food by which they would live."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2184.959,2185.676,Yes.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.924,2212.276,Would you agree then that necessity enters into this calculation?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2212.276,2221.232,I think it does in the sense that they do need... that the measure of necessity is the amount of water that's needed to irrigate the practicability irrigable land.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.379,2245.299,There is no argument in this case about how much water is necessary to irrigate an acre?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2245.299,2255.555,"I don't believe so, except tot the fact of the matter... not in this case... that we're being held... the tribes are being held to a stricter efficiency standard than anyone else in both their historic lands and their future lands."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.709,2261.042,Do we usually get--
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2266.946,2269.731,"That's... well, that is in the very nature of a reserved water right."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.731,2272.398,"Well, it doesn't have to be."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2272.398,2272.817,I think--
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.817,2273.633,It certainly doesn't.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2273.633,2276.135,--I think that that has been the clear implication.
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.135,2277.585,"Well, it doesn't have to be."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2282.37,2283.02,"Well, it there is a problem--"
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.02,2285.655,"--I mean, under most... under most state laws you either use it or lose it."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2285.655,2288.457,--But the federal reserve water rights are an exception to the--
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.457,2298.248,It's not a total exception as if it stood there on a plateau all by itself while all the appropriative rights went down to nothing.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2304.05,2313.091,"--But if the water was initially reserved for the reservation, it was set aside by Congress, the it seems as if Congress is the party that needs to worry if there are later shortcomings--"
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2313.091,2316.543,"But, of course, the whole... the whole Winters Doctrine is just an implication to Congress."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2326.313,2327.082,--But I think Congress--
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2327.082,2327.948,And they certainly haven't spoken with--
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2327.948,2336.871,"--has relied on every decision since the... has been relying on every decision since the 1908 Winters decision, including the Powers decision, including Arizona I."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2340.64,2355.499,"--Mr. Minear, do you have any idea now many more areas there are in the United States where there are reserved water rights for tribes that haven't yet been determined?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2355.499,2357.517,"Well, I think that there are a good number of those."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.39,2370.24,"Well, there are a lot more yet to be determined, in other words."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2370.24,2372.225,There are a fair number that need to be determined.
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2372.675,2373.108,Like how many?
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2373.108,2376.11,"--many of them... there could be as many as 20, I suppose."
1988.88-309,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2376.11,2376.496,Uh-huh.
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2376.496,2376.962,Perhaps more.
1988.88-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2376.962,2382.514,"But the PIA standard as set in the Master's Report in Arizona I, isn't that a legal principle?"
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2385.984,2397.891,"I think that when a Special Master's Report has been incorporated into existing law to the extent that the Special Master's Report has here, I think it's very important to recognize the element of certainty that it has created."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.743,2411.283,"If there is anything that is created under certainty around... in the water business in the western states, it's this whole process of quantifying the reserved right."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2411.283,2413.968,"--But I think once the right is quantified, there is no uncertainty."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.968,2415.587,"Well, it hasn't been quantified yet with Wyoming."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2415.587,2426.359,"And with respect to the notion of shortages the Chief Justice raised, I'd simply point out that the Wyoming Supreme Court noted here that there would be... there was no indication of any gallon-for-gallon reduction in this case."
1988.88-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.606,2461.782,"But you would never... you would... once... your suggestion is that if we set... once the reserved right is established with a priority date of 1868, there is never any other water right going to take precedence over that."
1988.88-309,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2461.782,2462.965,"Well, that's right in this basin."
1988.88-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.423,2477.892,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1988.88-309,2,42226,susan_m_williams,,2489.866,2493.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-309,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.084,2627.921,"Ms. Williams, the Winters Doctrine was just an intent that this Court attributed to Congress, wasn't it?"
1988.88-309,2,42226,susan_m_williams,,2632.492,2633.225,--That's correct.
1988.88-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.337,2681.473,What is the Indian population on the reservation?
1988.88-309,2,42226,susan_m_williams,,2681.473,2689.329,"The current Indian population on the Wind River Indian Reservation is about 5,400 Indians."
1988.88-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.329,2691.031,What was it in 1868?
1988.88-309,2,42226,susan_m_williams,,2692.964,2696.916,"We are not clear, but it was something much smaller than that size there."
1988.88-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.475,3056.449,Do you think the... do you think the reserved right should incorporate or should be used to maintain instream flows?
1988.88-309,2,42226,susan_m_williams,,3056.449,3064.221,The reserved right that was set aside in 1868 was to be primarily for agricultural purposes.
1988.88-309,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.288,3093.574,"Thank... thank you, Ms. Williams."
1988.88-309,3,36853,michael_douglas_white,,3097.592,3100.894,"I do, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.98,3131.282,Should the rule against going outside the record work both ways?
1988.88-309,3,36853,michael_douglas_white,,3132.332,3135.384,"--I suppose, Your Honor, but if you'd like to ask me about the record, I'd be glad to respond."
1988.88-309,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.384,3138.086,I'd rather stick to the record on both sides myself.
1988.88-309,3,36853,michael_douglas_white,,3138.086,3142.907,"Well, if I've... it I have failed to do so, Your Honor, I wish you'd call it to my--"
1988.88-309,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.907,3146.275,"Well, you did fall to do so You have a long section in your brief on what happened after the trial."
1988.88-309,3,36853,michael_douglas_white,,3146.275,3147.059,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1988.88-309,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.316,3193.07,"Well, ordinarily we take the word of the Supreme Court of the state over the district court unless it's some obvious mistake."
1988.88-309,3,36853,michael_douglas_white,,3196.189,3198.124,"They didn't look at it, Your Honor."
