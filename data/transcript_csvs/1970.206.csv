1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.682,"We’ll hear arguments in number 206, Viven Harris against State of New York."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,33.173,33.863,Thank you.
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,160.24,162.144,Who was the trial judge?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,162.144,167.38,"Judge Robert E. Dempsey, Your Honor."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.567,247.933,"And of course as of that time he didn’t have either of those rights under the United States of Constitution, did he?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,247.933,254.825,"At that date, Your Honor, Miranda had not come down and the standard had not been explicitly decided."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.825,255.191,Right.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,255.191,262.563,"On the other hand, it is my view and I commend to you that Escobedo was in existence at that time."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.563,263.969,"Well, that’s a fact and it’s not a matter of opinion."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,263.969,276.266,But the opinion which I believe Your Honor wrote said that confession obtained under such circumstances could not be used.
1970.206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,406.367,410.162,"Counsel, let me ask a trait question."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,420.385,421.209,"Yes, Judge."
1970.206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,446.934,454.307,"Well, this is my next question is, whether you are arguing prejudice in the light of the acquittal on the one count?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,454.307,462.762,"Yes, I would like to explain my view on that and perhaps your question makes this the appropriate time."
1970.206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.577,526.549,"Sodium bicarbonate, he said didn’t he?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,526.549,538.042,"I believe that’s correct Judge, by the point was it had just enough for of a kick to deceive anybody who was a snorter which was their impression of what detective Bermudas was masquerading (Voice Overlap)."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,595.761,600.177,"I have a little trouble with the facts of this case, Mr. Aurnou."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,617.596,619.151,We disagree on that Your Honor (Voice Overlap).
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.298,621.554,"Standing independently, --"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,621.554,621.643,"Yes, as to the second count."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,621.643,626.915,"-- the statement he made -- how was that -- was it, tell me why and how is a confession."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,626.915,636.346,"Because it indicated: (a) That he had furnished the heroin and (b) that by taking back a taste, it was in fact heroin that he had furnished and received money for."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.659,659.675,I thought it was only one combined with the testimony that he gave in court that it became damaging –-
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,659.675,661.032,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.547,672.493,Right.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,672.493,675.367,Either at the time of the prior statement of the trial.
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.367,675.955,Right.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,675.955,684.822,But it also had an independent evil effect of it’s own as a confession and I would not have you think I conceive in anyway --
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.822,686.583,With respect to the second count?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,686.583,687.557,That’s right.
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,687.557,691.021,"Alright, now secondly."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,696.095,702.017,"Unfortunately Judge, that aspect of the record was foreclosed by the prosecution."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.86,745.374,"Well, I didn’t quite understand the -- I heard what you said but my question was, is there any claim that it was coerced?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,745.374,748.169,"Well, that’s what I’m -- I’m sorry if I’ve been wordy Judge, I didn’t mean to evade."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.169,749.218,I like it.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,749.218,765.551,"What I meant to say was that when we attempted to raise it in New York, when we asked for a hearing on that issue, we were foreclosed by the prosecution’s objection that the result of such a voluntariness hearing wouldn’t prevent him from using it."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.803,828.467,"Well, then as to coercion or the involuntariness of the statement, do I understand it to be your submission that because of the attitude of the prosecutor took, the ruling of the court was, that even assuming it was coerced, it can still be used."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,828.467,829.297,"Exactly, but I also said --"
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.297,836.735,"And then that we should decide this case therefore on the hypothesis, or whatever the facts may be, that this was coerced?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,836.735,837.591,Exactly.
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1018.095,1021.991,Are you suggesting the Walder case be overruled then?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1021.991,1027.285,"Yes, I am Judge but I think it can also be read consistently with the position that I take."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1027.285,1032.231,"Well, in Walder it was clearly an unconstitutional search as I recall it –-"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1032.231,1033.067,"That was the first distinction, Your Honor."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1033.067,1035.567,"That was a search and seizure, wasn’t it?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1035.567,1035.853,Yes.
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1067.556,1076.298,"And I gone over that rather fast, it isn’t as clear to everyone as it seems to be to use that the Walder case is overruled."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1076.298,1078.248,"No, I didn’t say that Walder have been overruled."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1112.627,1119.214,"Well, in the second, in the trial that came before the Court, when the decision is made, that was another narcotic charge, wasn’t it?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1119.214,1127.539,"Yes it was, this was evidence of a prior offense and to some extent, perhaps, a predisposition to commit this type of offense, but it was not evidence of this charge."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1127.539,1131.235,"It wasn’t admitted for impeachment on that purpose, is it?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1131.235,1131.991,That’s correct.
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1132.198,1135.143,It was admitted because he denied that he had ever had.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1135.143,1141.258,Because he went beyond the latitude of the denial of the charges itself.
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1226.269,1228.529,Not unless he takes a stand?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1228.529,1229.149,I beg your pardon?
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1229.149,1230.805,Not unless the defendant takes a stand?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1230.805,1237.311,"No, I disagree with that because it also has a value in discouraging him from ever taking the stand."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1237.311,1247.007,"Well that’s a fact of life though if you got to -- if you contemplate perjury when you take the stand, this is somewhat discouraging."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1247.007,1256.037,"I don’t think that’s the only situation in which it can arise Your Honor, that’s the implication of the respondent and amicus briefs but I think this."
1970.206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1462.991,1467.745,"Of course on that approach, the Miranda should be fully retroactive, should it not?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1467.745,1478.951,"Well, I will say this, I think -- I think the opinion in Johnson indicated that Miranda could have been fully retroactive."
1970.206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1478.951,1498.31,And you’re operating here an unfortunate chronology -- had Johnson said that retroactivity was directed to the time of the taking of the statement rather than the time of the beginning of the trial which should be here today?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1498.31,1505.241,"Yes, because in that posture, could they possibly have denied us the hearing on voluntariness."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.131,1550.079,Is the statement in question accurately reported in full --
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1550.079,1550.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.277,1552.725,-- on pages 72 to 78 of the appendix (Voice Overlap)?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1552.725,1554.982,Mr. Duggan and I have stipulated at this.
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.982,1556.894,And that’s an active statement so whether or not --
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1556.894,1557.687,"To the best of our knowledge, it is."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.687,1559.622,-- to ignore your admission or the confession?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1559.622,1564.911,"Yes, I only say to you that we never had the opportunity for a hearing to establish otherwise despite our request."
1970.206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.911,1566.743,Thank you.
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1566.743,1577.327,(Inaudible)
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1577.327,1583.989,"Your Honor, you have to appreciate first that I was assigned by the court in the appellate division so that I do not know what transpired at the trial."
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1583.989,1584.994,Is that in the record?
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1584.994,1594.318,"In the record, I can only say that every attempt to explore that was forbidden because in the trial judges, it deal with -- it made no difference, even if it was involuntary."
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1594.318,1598.168,The Miranda point is thoroughly the point.
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1598.168,1599.34,The Miranda point --
1970.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1599.34,1604.907,It goes to the circumstances at the time of their waiver of counsel what’s there --
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1604.907,1620.205,"Well, I can only say to you that the Miranda point was raised and not explored because what happened was that the trial judge told the prosecutor, “You can do this but you run the risk that an appellate court will overturn in under Miranda.”"
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.246,1660.012,"But these rules that you’re talking about, all of them, Miranda all the way back to McNabb, these were traditionally constructive as a shield that when a man can take the stand and be immune from cross-examination and impeachment, he’s using it something more than a shield, isn’t he?"
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1660.012,1665.212,"I would agree that that would be true, if in fact that was the thrust and effect of what happen Your Honor."
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.496,1678.483,"Well, of course, some people think that there’s been a little over insulation."
1970.206,0,28804,joel_martin_aurnou,,1678.483,1684.707,I’m grateful Your Honor that this Court stands as a shield against that view.
1970.206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1694.39,1696.887,Mr. Duggan.
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,1696.887,1700.027,Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1928.114,1930.459,"Well, haven’t it come a little earlier in England?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,1930.459,1932.891,"Oh, I don’t mean -- I am not going all the way back."
1970.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.176,2003.566,What if this had been a coerced confession?
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2006.296,2026.905,"If this had been a coerced confession, it’s that people’s view and the respondent’s view that it couldn’t have been used for any purpose, because the entire thrust or the only thing we can tell to this Court is that because if it is a voluntary confession, its truth is greatly to be relied upon."
1970.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.868,2039.264,"Well, have you finished?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2039.264,2039.636,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.636,2041.865,I didn’t mean untrue confession.
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2047.9,2050.639,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.185,2078.752,"Well, that’s true."
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2107.759,2119.716,I don’t think so Mr. Justice Stewart because the thought is that we must have to find a class of confessions which may be used for these purposes.
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2131.626,2140.865,What you’re saying then that it can’t be given any use because it is inherently unreliable as being involuntary?
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2140.865,2143.489,"As being involuntary, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.489,2150.236,When is it determined that it is or is not voluntary?
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2150.236,2153.433,"You mean, as I would choose to use it without a pretrial?"
1970.206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.433,2155.712,"Well, let me give a hypothetical."
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2195.211,2195.392,Oh!
1970.206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.92,2203.904,"Once this challenge is being involuntary, then you have this sort of (Voice Overlap)?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2203.904,2204.421,Oh!
1970.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.712,2233.755,"Now, your brother in the other side has told us that because of the posture in which this question arose in the trial court, we must proceed upon a hypothesis that this was an involuntary -- that this was an involuntary confession?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2233.755,2245.635,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think perhaps, Mr. Aurnou may have expressed himself somewhat more enthusiastically than what was his intention."
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.971,2289.867,"When the prosecution sought to use it for impeachment purposes, was there any request for a hearing on the involuntariness of the confession?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2289.867,2297.719,I would have to get these minutes to refresh my recollection before I could give you an absolutely definitive answer Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.45,2312.593,"It wasn’t -- it never was offered in evidence, was it?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2312.593,2312.791,Oh!
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.185,2318.074,"It simply cross-examined on the basis of the statements, did he not?"
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2318.074,2321.888,I can’t be entirely honest and give you the answer that I would choose to give you.
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2345.823,2347.243,But only for appellate review.
1970.206,1,29836,james_j_duggan,,2347.243,2354.31,"Only for the purpose of identifying, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.329,2619.712,Very well.
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,2620.925,2624.31,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.633,2777.703,"When he was cross-examined by way of impeachment, can you tell us now what his responses were --"
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,2777.703,2777.86,Yes.
1970.206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.86,2780.291,"-- when he was asked, “Did you make this statement?”"
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,2780.291,2780.685,Yes.
1970.206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.013,2852.694,"How was he confronted, verbally or?"
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,2852.694,2854.422,"Verbally, he was asked, “Do you remember?”"
1970.206,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.322,3022.45,"Ms. Landau, the instructions are -- the charge for jury is quite lengthy here, can you tell me what page it’s on?"
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,3022.45,3026.333,"Yes, I have to look at my brief to do that."
1970.206,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.183,3030.336,I can’t see the claims.
1970.206,2,41658,sybil_h_landau,,3030.336,3033.552,"It’s in my brief and I talked about the facts, Mr. Justice Stewart."
