1991.91-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.499,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-594, American National Red Cross, Petitioner, v. S. G. and A. E.."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,13.511,16.383,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.322,151.014,And I suppose we could explain the result in Osborn by saying that that was an instrumentality of the United States.
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,154.696,158.349,I agree with that; and there is no question that the Red Cross is an instrumentality of the United States.
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.609,167.965,"Well, but was the Bank of the United States not an instrumentality in another sense?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,173.089,174.078,"I believe not, Justice Kennedy."
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.563,180.013,"Well, then McCulloch v. Maryland was wrong."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,180.013,195.182,"No, Your Honor, McCulloch v. Maryland was right, and McCulloch v. Maryland was applied to the Red Cross in the Department of Employment v. United States, and has been applied to Army post exchanges... to other similar entities, that while not agencies of the United States are tax-immune instrumentalities of the United States."
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.182,200.197,Does the Red Cross have a special tax exemption?
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,200.197,207.341,"It has been held by this Court to have a special tax exemption, by virtue of its status as an instrumentality of the United States."
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.341,211.825,But as a matter of our jurisprudence and not just some statutory... expressed statutory provision?
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,211.825,212.356,That's correct.
1991.91-594,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.606,240.693,"Well, I thought the international charter of the Red Cross made it rather clear that a national organization should not be any part of governmental entity."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,243.375,251.89,"No, Your Honor, that argument, too, was made to this Court in the Department of Employment v. United States case, and rejected... and has been rejected by the Ninth Circuit in subsequent cases."
1991.91-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.263,292.568,Did you cite Department of Employment to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit?
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,292.568,293.598,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.598,298.272,"Mr. Englert, don't you think language in Osborn is really quite different?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,315.503,319.236,"Well, we think it's equally clear that the Congress that wrote the Red Cross charter had jurisdiction in mind."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.236,321.527,"Well, what's the first half of it in this one?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,321.527,325.878,State and Federal courts are referred to in parallel fashion in the Red Cross charter.
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.69,329.681,State or Federal.
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,334.775,335.496,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.798,337.278,Of course not.
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,345.684,349.264,"Well, Professor Wright certainly disagrees with that proposition."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.465,351.086,"Well, maybe he is wrong."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,351.086,351.867,--question the Osborn ruling.
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.384,387.409,"Did the First Bank... the First Bank of the United States provision say in all State courts having competent jurisdiction, as well?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,387.409,389.212,"No, it referred to courts of record."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.993,390.374,Courts of record.
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,391.571,393.474,--It did not refer to jurisdiction at all.
1991.91-594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.983,477.119,"Mr. Englert, do you plan to address the constitutional concerns that were raised in the respondents' brief, and tell us in what way cases arise under Federal law within the meaning of article 3, simply because the Red Cross is a litigant?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,477.119,481.153,"Well, that question was addressed and answered for the first time in Osborn."
1991.91-594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.156,495.593,"Well, don't you think in Verlinden and more recent cases this Court has been wary of that kind of a... an approach?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,495.593,498.725,This Court has been wary of extending that kind of approach.
1991.91-594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.511,527.933,"Well, what law is going to apply in the tort suit, do you suppose?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,527.933,528.874,State law.
1991.91-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.126,538.191,"Well, it does, as in the... it certainly does, as a matter of plausible, logical argument, even if not precedent."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,538.191,548.447,"--Well, Your Honor, as was pointed out in Verlinden, the Court has taken two divergent paths in interpreting arising under, under the statute and under the Constitution."
1991.91-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.95,622.135,"Do you have any further justification for the doctrine on its merits, rather than on the basis of state decisis?"
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,622.135,622.916,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.658,719.588,"Well, maybe the Court wasn't, but the Constitution was."
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,743.043,768.942,"--No, and that's exactly why in Bank of the United... in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, Chief Justice Marshall examined for the Court the meaning of the grant of arising under jurisdiction in the Constitution and not one of those other grants of jurisdiction in article 3, section 2, and held that it was within the jurisdiction, within the constitutionally granted jurisdiction that Congress could confer, to have that kind of party-based jurisdiction in suits by and against an instrumentality of the United States."
1991.91-594,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,815.975,816.854,What... may I... excuse me.
1991.91-594,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,824.23,830.604,"--Your Honor, I don't think there was any serious question about the possibility of diversity jurisdiction at any time since 1905."
1991.91-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,912.728,913.93,"Very well, Mr. Englert."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,915.569,928.858,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1001.256,1009.192,"Is that established law, Mr. Mann, that if someone... if in a corporation is, quote, related, close quote, to the Federal Government it's not subject to punitive damages?"
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1009.192,1016.097,"No, it is not established Federal law, but it is an issue of Federal law that the Red Cross plans to raise in this particular case."
1991.91-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.211,1026.145,"Well, that sounds like bootstrapping, though, to say we're going to raise an issue of Federal law; we have no cases to support it."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1031.539,1033.589,--I must have misunderstood your question.
1991.91-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.738,1052.412,"Well, I thought Mr. Englert had indicated a concession that State law would apply to this suit."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1052.412,1053.443,--I believe that--
1991.91-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.443,1059.648,"And it seems to me you're now arguing that, at least in some areas, Federal law is applicable."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1059.648,1061.32,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-594,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.935,1120.221,"Well, what's the general principle that you're arguing, that it is then an instrumentality of the United States, unlike, say, a railroad that has a Federal... charter?"
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1120.221,1129.357,"In our view, it's also well established that a railroad chartered by Congress would... cases to which a railroad was a party, would arise under Federal law."
1991.91-594,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.421,1142.317,So then all of these important international and national attributes of the Red Cross are really quite beside the point so far as your standard is concerned?
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1142.317,1145.139,--I think they're beside the point under this Court's precedent.
1991.91-594,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.893,1172.346,So your legal standard is the proximity of relation to the United States Government is controlling?
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1172.346,1194.781,"I believe that it would... if this Court wished to cut back on the constitutional rule that it has articulated in the Pacific Railroad Removal cases, it would be unlikely that it would do so to an extent that would deprive entities that are as closely related to the Federal Government as the Red Cross, and perform statutory and treaty-mandated function as important as those that are performed by the Red Cross."
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.708,1271.531,"Well, of course, to the extent that you're saying there's almost a Federal issue in every case that they're a party to you don't... you don't have to win this case."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1274.013,1282.049,"No, that's not entirely accurate, Justice Stevens, because to get in under Federal question jurisdiction you have to come in under section 1331 of title 28."
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.401,1339.466,"Well, one of the first questions is whether we should adopt a construction of the statute that makes it entirely unnecessary to even consider the constitutional problem."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1346.221,1348.592,That's entirely accurate.
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.435,1352.886,There's just not a substantial question.
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1352.886,1354.616,--in this case.
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.952,1492.057,"How do you explain the statement of Mr. Spofford that the only amendment of section 2 is to make it clear that suits can be maintained in Federal as well as States' courts, which has not been clear?"
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1492.057,1495.159,The--
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.159,1498.952,"You can answer that question, I think."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1498.952,1511.151,--My understanding of the context of the discussion in the hearings is that the discussion in that case... the discussion in the hearings was focused on the question as to why the charter did not also include a right to sue in foreign courts.
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.601,1512.322,"No, that came up later."
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1514.343,1516.245,"--At the very beginning, his explanation of it?"
1991.91-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.245,1516.995,Yeah.
1991.91-594,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1516.995,1531.275,"We believe that that is a precursor, and substantially means the same thing as the explanation and the discussion after recommendation 22, which states that what they meant by that was that there was a doubt regarding the jurisdiction because of the limited nature of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts."
1991.91-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.495,1536.488,"Thank you, Mr. Mann."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1538.629,1555.099,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1718.199,1721.929,"In other words, you're not asking us to overrule the Osborn case?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1721.929,1723.36,"--I don't think it's necessary in this case, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1733.947,1737.63,"We seldom overrule Chief Justice Marshall, I suppose."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1737.63,1738.919,I'm not suggesting that.
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.24,1863.731,"Yes, but let me ask you this question, if I may--"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1863.731,1864.262,Sure.
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.262,1865.784,--why did they have to add the word Federal?
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1878.251,1884.456,"I don't think that's true, Your Honor, because... I don't think that--"
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.456,1885.307,Your opponent told us it was true.
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1886.345,1888.097,"--Yes, I think that... that part of it is true."
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.643,1927.183,--And before that... what you're saying is that--
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1927.183,1927.655,--until after--
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.655,1934.207,--time it was not clear that a corp... a corporation domiciled in the District was a citizen of the State for diversity purposes.
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1934.207,1935.449,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1990.514,1991.546,"Well, wasn't that true in D'Oench?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,1991.546,1995.529,--D'Oench is a case which can be distinguished.
1991.91-594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2013.0,2015.201,"This Court didn't rely on that language, did it?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2015.201,2021.405,"It's not clear what... the case was not even litigated on the jurisdictional issue, as far as I can tell."
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2077.722,2089.831,"I suppose it's of no legal consequence, but what is the comparative condition of the court calendars in Federal court and State court in New Hampshire?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2089.831,2100.997,"Well, I understand from my limited conversations with the Federal judges, that they're just as busy as they can be."
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2102.857,2108.892,"Well, if you stayed on the State side, would this case come on sooner than if you were on the Federal side?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2108.892,2110.084,"I would say yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2110.084,2114.335,By very much?
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2114.335,2115.126,Pardon me?
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2115.126,2116.378,By very much?
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2116.378,2118.999,I can't honestly say that's true.
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2138.371,2145.547,I might say that's not true everywhere.
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2145.547,2148.879,I'm sure that's true.
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.428,2196.501,"Mr. Upton, can I ask you another question about your reliance--"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2196.501,2196.658,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.658,2197.109,--on Tidewater.
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2207.687,2208.958,That's correct.
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.958,2217.013,"Well, why wouldn't the same constitutional doubt apply to the amendment to the Red Cross charter, if it related only to diversity jurisdiction?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2234.823,2238.126,"Well, let me say this."
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.657,2322.214,"Of course a simpler way, if they wanted just to be sure, and avoid any question on diversity jurisdiction was to make the corporation a citizen of Maryland rather than the District."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2322.214,2323.016,That would have been--
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.016,2325.016,Which would... that would have made it perfectly clear--
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2325.016,2326.847,--much better.
1991.91-594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.847,2328.59,--that that's all they wanted to do was to give diversity jurisdiction.
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2328.59,2330.59,That could well have been done.
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2342.508,2356.216,"Mr. Upton, do you think the Bankers Trust case, which involved a railroad, and applied to all railroads in the country, really, is any different from this case which applies to one corporation, the American Red Cross?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2356.216,2359.318,I don't think there's any difference in the principle--
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2359.318,2369.736,"From a pragmatic point of view, I suppose the Court, as it was constructed back... looked with alarm on every railroad case coming into Federal court."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2369.736,2385.537,"--Well, there could be some alarm with whether or not other Federal corporations with similar charters may attempt to invoke Federal jurisdiction, if this case is... if we construe this charter as a grant of Federal jurisdiction."
1991.91-594,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2385.537,2388.29,So you think there are cases that hang on this one then?
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2388.29,2393.872,I think there are other Federal corporations... I can cite three... which have very similar charters.
1991.91-594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.14,2549.185,"How does the 1925 statute, Mr. Upton, fit into the analytic way you approach the case?"
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2549.185,2567.717,"I think that that statute requires clear and specific language, in the same way that if you're going to create the exception to the usual rule in construing sue and be sued clauses, you'd want clear and specific language."
1991.91-594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.246,2599.608,"Of course, if they use the language that they used in D'Oench, Duhme, they might have created the consequence that ensued in D'Oench, Duhme, which would... there would have been a Federal common law governing the Red Cross, which perhaps they did not want."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2599.608,2603.02,"Well, that's true, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2886.279,2895.645,"Well, of course, the closer analogy is Osborn, where the Court held that a similar provision didn't violate article 3."
1991.91-594,2,33326,j_gilbert_upton,,2897.037,2907.683,"In a sense, but I wonder if the law of Osborn is still good law today on that point, since it's been overruled legislatively already."
1991.91-594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.378,2961.098,"Thank you, Mr. Upton."
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2964.782,2967.874,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-594,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.79,2999.025,What is the closest case in this Court on the jury trial issue?
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2999.025,3000.154,Lehman v. Nakshian.
1991.91-594,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.154,3001.466,What?
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3001.466,3002.486,Lehman v. Nakshian.
1991.91-594,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.385,3080.407,"Yeah, but what about the fact that that's... that charter said, in so many words, any case to which the Federal entity as a party shall be deemed to arise under Federal law... you are, in effect, saying that we should treat the sue and be sued clause as though it incorporated a similar sentence implicitly."
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3080.407,3081.098,--Absolutely not.
1991.91-594,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.179,3098.42,"Well, you aren't asking for development of Federal law."
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3103.121,3104.594,"I think not, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.57,3164.102,"But in D'Oench, Duhme, the fact remains that there was that other provision, and indeed it was... it was cited by the Court in the same breath in which the Court said that the corporation brings this suit under an act of Congress authorizing it to sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State or Federal."
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3164.102,3166.243,"Well, I could quarrel with the same breath, since it's in a footnote."
1991.91-594,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.243,3169.186,"Well, the best way you could do it in the same breath is to put it in a footnote."
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3174.578,3176.511,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.484,3186.148,"Well, you've read Justice Douglas' opinions before, haven't you?"
1991.91-594,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3186.766,3191.22,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-594,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3232.427,3234.027,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
