1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,We will hear arguments next in Hopper against Evans.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,60.705,67.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a federal habeas case here on certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,304.688,307.724,There is no dispute about all this so far?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,307.724,309.04,"--No dispute at all, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,309.04,320.881,"In that statement, in one of his statements, did he not at least imply strongly that if confined, as distinguished from being executed, he would escape and kill again?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,320.881,327.101,"Yes, Your Honor, he, as a matter of fact, told the jury that at the trial, and he told the grand jury that."
1981.80-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.834,406.617,Could you--
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,406.617,407.553,--Excuse me.
1981.80-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.553,414.207,--tell me whether there was any attempt made to file a habeas petition in the state courts first?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,414.207,415.057,"No, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.813,453.182,And the question could not have been raised in a state habeas?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,453.182,454.2,Could not have been raised.
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,512.185,516.755,"In other words, he did not make the argument on which the Fifth Circuit acted."
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,516.755,519.04,"--No, Your Honor, he surely didn't."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,646.205,662.131,"Mr. Carnes, at this point, if the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed and you lose this procedure here, in your view, are you jeopardizing all pre-Beck convictions in the state of Alabama?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,662.131,663.831,"There is no question about it, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,663.831,665.0,How many are there?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,665.0,681.276,"There were... reading the Alabama Supreme Court's Beck opinion on remand, there were at least 50, plus, from the time of that... my best estimate is, there were more than 60."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,681.276,682.442,Sixty?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,682.442,685.811,More than 60 pre-Beck convictions and sentences.
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,699.071,699.871,Under the Beck decision?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,699.871,700.654,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,700.654,704.206,"So that at the outside, only ten then would be affected by this one--"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,704.206,704.773,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,704.773,705.392,--if you lose.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,705.392,712.978,"It's Evans, Ritter, six more before this Court now, and perhaps two more in the state courts."
1981.80-1714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.911,746.802,"May I ask, while you are giving us this summary, those that you in effect concede were covered by Beck, are they all cases in which the record would have supported a lesser included offense?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,750.087,750.62,"--Yes, sir, all."
1981.80-1714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.62,751.304,--That was the theory?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,751.304,752.537,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.537,763.495,"And then the seven or eight cases other than Ritter and Evans, I take it, are cases in which one cannot be as sure as one might be here that the preclusion clause didn't really affect it--"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,763.495,764.078,Without question.
1981.80-1714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.078,765.43,--what was put into evidence or offered in evidence.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,765.43,766.064,Yes.
1981.80-1714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.427,1003.148,"Mr. Attorney General, what section in the Constitution says you have to show prejudice?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1003.148,1006.517,"Your Honor, it is more an interpretation of this Court--"
1981.80-1714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.517,1008.302,"But it is not in the Constitution, is it?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1008.302,1013.503,"--My understanding is, this Court has said it's in the Constitution by--"
1981.80-1714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1013.503,1016.472,"Well, I'm asking you, where is it in the Constitution?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1016.472,1024.328,--It is not on the boldfaced lettering of the Constitution.
1981.80-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.382,1035.119,Do you find it in the same place where you find the requirement that instruction be given on a lesser included offense?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1035.119,1035.786,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.502,1039.238,And on the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1039.238,1041.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.19,1044.475,I am still asking where.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1059.834,1072.375,We also find support for our position that this is a specially significant case because it is a habeas corpus case from Mr. Justice Stevens' separate opinion earlier this month in Rose v. Lundy.
1981.80-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.882,1292.084,"So did Beck, didn't it?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1292.084,1293.417,Yes.
1981.80-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.538,1304.088,Yes.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1304.088,1323.869,"The second position on the mandatory verdict form requirement is that it could not conceivably have affected even Evans' sentence in this particular case, because at every stage of the proceeding Evans had asked to be executed, before he was captured, throughout the grand jury, the trial, and so forth and so on."
1981.80-1714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.404,1499.145,"Mr. Attorney General, do you read the judgment of the court of appeals, if affirmed, as requiring habeas relief in the form of a new trial on guilt?"
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1499.145,1500.028,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1509.767,1513.054,Retried with the lesser included offense instructions.
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1513.054,1518.523,I don't know if they meant that or just retried with formal notice that he can raise them if he wants to.
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.523,1519.791,What else could it mean?
1981.80-1714,0,22092,edward_c_carnes,,1519.791,1526.962,"It could mean you've got to go back and give him another chance to say, well, let me try to dream up some lesser included offense."
1981.80-1714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.393,1553.995,Very well.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1562.249,1578.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think in order to get an adequate understanding of exactly what constitutional issues we deal with in this case, it's important to understand the framework of Alabama law as it applies directly to this particular situation."
1981.80-1714,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1632.928,1635.864,May death be imposed in either event?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1635.864,1639.149,Death may only be imposed in the case of the conviction for capital murder.
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.053,1651.409,"How does that fit the evidence in this case, that proposition of law that you have just stated?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1651.409,1659.479,"Chief Justice Burger, our position is really multifaceted on how that particular law fits this case."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.258,1706.476,Is this an additional argument for affirmance?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1709.245,1711.947,"This is an additional argument for affirmance, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.947,1717.851,Can you give me the exact testimony of other evidence that backs that up?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1717.851,1719.067,"I can, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.873,1730.742,Did you present this argument--
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1731.609,1733.861,Did we present the argument to the court of appeals?
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.861,1734.777,This particular argument.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1734.777,1738.764,This particular argument was not presented exactly to the court of appeals.
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1738.764,1740.88,Will you give me a page?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1743.966,1744.834,It is page--
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.834,1746.251,Blue brief?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1746.251,1754.274,"--The Joint Appendix, Pages 12 through 35, I believe, is Mr. Evans' grand jury testimony."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1754.274,1758.642,"That is his brief, the brief for Petitioner?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1758.642,1761.844,"I am talking about the Joint Appendix, Justice Marshal."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.844,1763.546,That's not blue.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1766.265,1777.472,"The Joint Appendix, Pages 8 through Pages 23 contain the grand jury testimony of particular... pardon me, of Mr. Evans."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.472,1786.911,And I want to know what part of that gives any basis for a lesser included offense.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1786.911,1792.982,"First of all, Justice Marshal, on Page 21 of the Joint Appendix."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.982,1799.636,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1799.636,1801.005,"Mr. Evans testifies,"
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1812.979,1816.097,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1816.814,1817.831,Pardon me?
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.831,1819.965,He didn't think anybody would get hurt.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1819.965,1822.767,And then on Page 19--
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.767,1823.884,With a loaded gun.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1823.884,1828.738,"--Then on Page 19 of the Joint Appendix, it says,"
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.6,1854.806,How do you square that with what he said that you have repeated or your friend repeated on Page 6 of the blue brief?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1854.806,1856.339,"It may well be, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.339,1858.674,"Well, how do you square the two things?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1872.183,1878.337,"This is the same John Lewis Evans, and that's precisely the point, Chief Justice Burger, is that there is a conflict in evidence."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.487,1884.575,"But this is the evidence that was before the jury, is it not?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1884.575,1886.441,That is the evidence before the trial jury.
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.133,1897.983,This... on Page 6?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1897.983,1898.667,--On Page 6.
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.19,1915.177,What part of what is reproduced on Page 6 would have entitled him to a lesser included offense charge?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1915.177,1917.629,"The fact that he says,"
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.216,1925.652,"Well, when are you going to get to that?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1939.626,1942.327,I was working my way there as I was talking about Alabama law.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.327,1942.863,Right.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1942.863,1943.863,Let me--
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.863,1945.013,I haven't let you get there.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,1945.513,1947.498,--Let me go back to that particular point.
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.344,2110.937,"Well, what if this trial had taken place after our decision in Beck, and the Alabama court had simply said, we know we have to give an instruction on a lesser included offense if the evidence supports one, but here there just isn't any evidence supporting one."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2115.806,2121.81,"We would suggest that that would frame an issue, a federal constitutional issue under this Court's Beck decision."
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.81,2132.018,"Well, can you imagine this Court or any other court deciding that with no evidence to support it it was a constitutional requirement that you had to give an instruction on a lesser included offense?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2132.018,2137.921,"Justice Rehnquist, where we clearly differ is how the relevant inquiry proceeds."
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.229,2159.501,"Well, I am hypothesizing a case that came after Beck, so that the defendant would have been on notice that he could have an instruction if the evidence supported it."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2159.501,2176.796,"Given the state of Alabama law, which is this incredibly liberal standard as to what lesser included offense instructions you are entitled to, I would find it a rare case in Alabama where a trial jury in a capital murder case was not instructed on the issue of capital murder and felony murder."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.818,2196.857,"Counsel, do I understand you that there is nothing in the trial record that justifies a lesser included offense instruction?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2196.857,2205.011,"Justice Marshal, our position on that point is that the evidence as actually presented to the trial jury."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.011,2222.888,"Well, I'm talking about... that's the only kind of evidence I understand, is that there's nothing in this record, you admit that there is nothing in this record that justifies a charge, an instruction on a lesser included offense."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2222.888,2224.321,We do not concede that point.
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.683,2242.683,Was it offered?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2242.683,2245.984,Was it offered to the court and then refused?
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.984,2246.586,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2246.586,2248.086,"No, it was not, Justice Marshal."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.086,2250.621,"Well, what can you complain of if something is not offered?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2250.621,2260.911,"Well, I think we are into the whole question of constitutional error, and what burdens are upon whom to show what in a particular--"
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.911,2269.1,"Well, what constitutional provision gives you the right to complain about evidence that you didn't offer?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2269.1,2283.177,"--Justice Marshal, John Evans was convicted and tried under an unconstitutional death penalty scheme, as unconstitutional as the schemes this Court struck down in Woodson, as unconstitutional as the schemes it struck down in Furman."
1981.80-1714,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2288.846,2292.381,"Counsel, you are here, though, on collateral attack."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2304.356,2309.925,"Under Wainwright and Sykes, we must show cause and prejudice if there is some sort of procedural default."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.548,2373.35,"Well, what was the statute struck down in Beck?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2373.35,2376.035,This--
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.035,2378.237,What was the rule struck down in Beck?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2378.237,2387.343,--The specific holding of the Court was that the lesser included offense... that the preclusion of lesser included offense instructions was constitutionally infirm.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.343,2392.246,There was an Alabama rule that it wouldn't have done you any good to offer evidence of a lesser included offense.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2392.246,2392.979,"That's exactly right, Justice White."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.979,2395.115,Because there was a flat rule against submitting it to the jury.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2395.115,2395.648,Exactly.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.648,2399.75,"So you were told, don't offer evidence."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2399.75,2402.852,We were told that offering evidence would mean nothing.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.852,2403.285,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2403.285,2414.243,"But you haven't yet, at least for my ear, mentioned a scintilla of evidence that would hint of a lesser included offense."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.228,2468.795,"Counsel, let me try again."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2485.106,2486.539,"That's right, Justice Marshal."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.539,2489.827,"Well, what in the world stopped him from testifying?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2497.997,2499.766,He certainly could have.
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.766,2501.468,And he didn't.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2501.468,2502.335,And he didn't.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.539,2510.574,"Well, there was a rule of law that said it wouldn't have done him any good."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2510.574,2512.591,There was a rule of law that said it wouldn't have done him any good.
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.358,2517.144,But wasn't that same... wasn't that rule in effect when he testified before the grand jury?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2517.144,2518.144,"Yes, it was."
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.144,2519.512,And still he testified.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2519.512,2520.796,And still he testified.
1981.80-1714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.718,2533.154,Some place I missed the point.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2533.154,2548.347,"Again, the basic thrust of our argument is that this is an Eighth Amendment violation and prejudice must be presumed, or it is a fundamental type of Fourteenth Amendment violation from which prejudice must be presumed."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2574.914,2579.318,Are you suggesting sub silentio that there was ineffective assistance of counsel here?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2579.318,2582.17,"We have never suggested that there was, Chief Justice Burger."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.262,2607.118,He was also operating within the confines of that statement which Evans made to the jury that he did it and he would do it again the first chance he got.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2607.118,2624.044,"And also within the confines of the statement that he gave to the grand jury that it was instinct, that it was reflex, that it was self-preservation, that they never went into the store to harm anybody, and in fact in this alleged crime spree that Evans and Ritter went through, they never harmed anybody during the course of that crime spree."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2629.664,2632.749,His statement is that he had killed other people.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2632.749,2636.987,There is one reference in his statement--
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.987,2640.089,"Well, that's enough for that one person, isn't it?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2640.089,2648.861,"--No question, Chief Justice Burger, but this crime spree that the state makes so much about, there were no allegations that another homicide had occurred during that crime spree."
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2689.32,2695.307,"Well, Beck had the foresight to put in some evidence of a lesser included offense, did he not?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2695.307,2696.692,"He did, Justice Rehnquist."
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.692,2700.961,"And why not hold this defendant to that same standard, if he wants to raise the Beck question?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2700.961,2710.601,It seems to me to be a tortured interpretation of the law to say... to hold somebody to putting evidence in the record when it would have done him no good.
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.601,2713.201,"Well, certainly Beck managed to do it."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2713.201,2716.07,That was a tactical decision by his counsel.
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.07,2719.291,"Well, I take it this was a tactical decision, too."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2719.291,2726.111,"Again, unfortunately or fortunately, we really can only speculate as to why these things happened."
1981.80-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.932,2741.288,"Well, the general rule is that if you want to save a point or put something in evidence and the trial court refuses it, you make a proffer."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2741.288,2748.811,And I think what we are into now is a debate over what was the best course of action.
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2779.377,2783.548,"Again I come back, how do you reconcile what you are now saying with the statement that he made to the trial jury?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2783.548,2792.986,"There may be no way to reconcile those questions, but they clearly raise an intent issue, an intent issue that the jury should have decided."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2792.986,2799.323,How would you get the grand jury testimony before the jury after he made this statement?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2799.323,2807.496,"By suggesting to the defendant that he testify as he did before the grand jury, or by referencing that in some fashion."
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.496,2814.317,"Well, he said here he had talked to the lawyers, is it 20 or 30, or 30 or 40 times about this."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2829.326,2836.914,There was again a question which we contend was resolvable by a jury.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.753,2875.455,Has the Alabama Supreme Court decided this question?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2875.455,2878.491,The Alabama Supreme Court decided this precise question?
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.491,2879.074,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2879.074,2880.341,"It has not, Justice White."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.341,2889.196,"Well, has it... either way, has it said that Beck requires... must be applied in a case like this?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2890.529,2892.564,It has said nothing about this particular case.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.337,2903.804,Right.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2909.491,2912.812,No pre-Beck cases could get before it.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.168,2933.123,"But if the Attorney General is right, there is no collateral relief available in Alabama to get this question up on a pre-Beck case."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2933.123,2936.51,That is a possible interpretation.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.062,2946.033,Do you know whether there are any cases like that still in the state system?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2946.033,2947.933,Any cases like this?
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.933,2949.001,Pre-Beck cases.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2962.809,2963.245,That's exactly right.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.511,2967.697,"Well, then, did they ever explain why they said that?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2967.697,2975.902,They eventually on remand in the Ritter case from this Court said that they based their decision to order new trials on federal constitutional grounds.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.902,2985.508,"Well, they must have then rejected, A, harmless error, B, rejected the notion that there hadn't been cause and prejudice for failing to object to the instruction."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2985.508,2988.043,They must have done all those things.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.043,2989.193,They must have done all those things.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,2989.193,3014.558,"Finally, this is a capital case, and as this Court recently said in the Eddings case, where there are doubts, and clearly in this case there have to be doubts, again, all that can be given to this Court are the suppositions of both sides as to what happened and why certain things weren't done, why certain courses of action were taken."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.334,3031.436,And is that what the Alabama Supreme Court has done?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3031.436,3036.138,The Alabama Supreme Court has ordered new trials in all of the pre-Beck capital cases.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.138,3037.19,Except this one?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3037.19,3041.309,"Except this one, but it was not in front of them at the time."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.309,3041.642,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3045.427,3047.546,If there had been a certification?
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.546,3048.079,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3048.079,3052.998,"I don't think that's true, Justice White."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.532,3054.649,"Well, I don't know why not."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3060.52,3067.09,--The issues that the state sought to have certified did not involve any unsettled issues of state law.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.09,3067.876,Of state law.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3078.315,3083.636,"That has never been raised as an issue in any proceeding in this case, that I know of."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.636,3085.838,"Well, it is right on our table now."
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3085.838,3091.306,"Well, Alabama has a plain error rule which does not require objection."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.193,3097.978,Yes.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3097.978,3101.363,There is a question as to whether it could retroactively be applied to him.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.731,3185.35,How many pre-Beck cases are still unresolved?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3186.083,3193.289,"There are now... there is this one, and five cases where cert has been filed in this Court."
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.289,3194.056,From--
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3194.056,3197.908,From the Alabama Supreme Court's decision to order retrials.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.908,3200.11,"--Four, five?"
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3200.11,3200.643,Six.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.643,3201.176,Six.
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3207.33,3213.067,"I have tried two pre-Beck cases myself already, and there... the great, great majority--"
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.067,3217.102,--Because they were remanded by the Supreme Court of Alabama?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3217.102,3219.82,--Because they were remanded by the Supreme Court of Alabama for new trials.
1981.80-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.922,3225.207,There weren't cert in those cases?
1981.80-1714,1,29710,john_l_carroll,,3225.207,3226.657,--There weren't cert in any of those cases.
1981.80-1714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3229.326,3229.943,Thank you.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3231.111,3231.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3232.745,3234.647,"Mr. Attorney General, do you agree with those figures?"
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3234.647,3236.48,--The figures are roughly--
1981.80-1714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3236.48,3238.832,I thought you said... I thought there was a difference of one.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3238.832,3239.998,--There is.
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.945,3265.399,But there were some cases that were ordered to be retried by the Alabama Supreme Court on which cert wasn't taken.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3265.399,3275.938,"Yes, Your Honor, and those cases when we didn't take cert were cases in which there was lesser included offense evidence presented at trial and it was clear under this Court's decision in Beck that they were entitled to it."
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.409,3289.681,"Well, has the Alabama Supreme Court decided that it doesn't make any difference whether or not there is evidence of the lesser included offense?"
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3289.681,3301.405,"The Alabama Supreme Court decided... the Fifth Circuit convinced it, and they cited the Fifth Circuit Evans that the ""in every case"" language of this Court's Beck opinion meant in every case literally and not--"
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.405,3303.305,Whether or not there is evidence or not.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3303.305,3311.344,"--Yes, Your Honor, but they have emphatically stated that that is a federal constitutional holding, and if the state has any complaint with it, we should take it before this Court."
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.344,3312.044,I see.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3314.396,3319.034,"Exactly what we've done, and the Alabama Supreme Court will, of course, be bound by this Court's ruling."
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.656,3330.14,I see.
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3330.14,3331.858,--for that particular reason.
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.893,3343.047,"Well, you don't urge that the Wainwright against Sykes rule applies."
1981.80-1714,2,22092,edward_c_carnes,,3343.047,3349.284,"--No, sir, but this case is here on federal grounds, we are glad to have it here, and we make no contention at all about that."
1981.80-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.787,3420.666,"Well, the court of appeals said that it violates the fundamental notions of due process to say that he didn't present the evidence when there was a rule of law in Alabama that said there was no such thing as a lesser included offense instruction."
