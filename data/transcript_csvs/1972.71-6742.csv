1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.836,We’ll hear arguments next in Hurtado against the United States.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,57.368,65.418,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, how are you, gentlemen."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,585.388,597.222,"But what if a witness was subpoenaed from penitentiary, the Federal Penitentiary in Leavenworth Kansas, and subpoenaed down into Texas or Florida --"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,597.222,597.779,Your Honor --
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,597.779,601.053,-- and put in detention while he is waiting.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,603.099,606.114,You’re referring to a case which is already decided.
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,613.04,613.762,Yes.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,613.762,630.999,"And the Court distinguished that case as -- and I think rationally so because this was a person who was arguing that his right to work within the penitentiary, but this is a prisoner who is being held for another reason."
1972.71-6742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.239,674.159,"When -- if your client were -- actually testifying, he would get $20.00, wouldn’t he?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,674.159,678.526,"Your Honor, the answer to that is not in the record."
1972.71-6742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.587,680.718,What's your position?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,680.718,689.733,"Our position is that they were not paid in any case that we have found, but this is not in the record because this case came up for some --"
1972.71-6742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.733,701.58,"What -- is it your position the statute does not provide for payment to clients such as yours even for the period, where they are actually testified?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,701.58,702.868,No sir.
1972.71-6742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.119,730.601,How then is your client treated differently from other witnesses?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,730.601,742.965,"He is treated differently in a very, very substantial way and that is that in a witness that the example that was put it by one of the other justices."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,792.472,794.399,And he’s attending the trial then.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,797.519,799.171,"Well, so he is the man in jail here, Your Honor."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,802.172,804.46,Is the trial going on?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,805.429,807.537,"I submit to Your Honor, yes sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.989,831.586,(Voice Overlap) argue that if there weren’t a trial kind of play the Government would have great difficulty in justifying holding them at all?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,831.586,845.426,"Your Honor, we have a -- in our whole position, we have evaded the issue of procedural due process in the holding."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.688,917.387,"Is it correct that if they were not being held in jail, they would be or would have been deported by now?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,917.387,919.171,"Your Honor with this particular case, yes."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.171,920.879,(Voice Overlap)
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,920.879,929.028,"In this particular case, I think the record will show that there would no reason to hold them other than as witnesses at this time."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.561,931.413,Mr. Armendariz.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,931.413,932.186,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,932.186,940.638,If you’re going -- if we should agree with you that the $20.00 per day applies as well to the man in jail.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,944.209,958.048,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals downstairs in its decision stated what we contended at the time that this is a recognition by Congress that a man in jail."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,959.804,960.398,"Well, I know."
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,968.824,981.797,"It applies to those persons who are in custody, who are in jail, in order to provide toiletries and things that they need while they are in jail because notice that the other witness who is free gets $16.00."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,984.838,986.883,I'm afraid I haven’t made myself clear.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,986.883,987.667,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.667,989.112,If we agree with you.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,989.112,989.748,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.748,992.536,That your man was entitled to $20.00 a day.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,992.536,992.972,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,992.972,998.577,And that anyone in the position of your client is entitled to $20.00 a day and read the statute that way.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,998.577,998.951,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.951,1002.02,What do we do with the last sentence?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1002.02,1002.803,It’s an addendum.
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.679,1005.794,Applicable to whom?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1005.794,1007.922,Applicable to persons in jail.
1972.71-6742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1007.922,1009.526,So that you would want $21.00 for it.
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1009.526,1011.047,"$21.00, yes sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1029.284,1032.555,"So, you relate the $1.00 to the $16.00 for the man outside?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1032.555,1033.178,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1036.964,1041.583,"To the man outside unless he is in Government service, he really gets $36.00 a day?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1041.583,1043.388,"Yes, sir and then outside --"
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1043.388,1046.281,"You say since your man is in prison, he at least gets $21.00?"
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1046.281,1047.814,"$21.00 yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.412,1049.803,That’s what this is all about?
1972.71-6742,0,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,1049.803,1052.271,"This is what this is all about, yes sir."
1972.71-6742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.838,1063.655,Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1063.655,1070.745,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.333,1251.984,And you say this is a jurisdictional question?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1251.984,1254.71,I'm just trying to find out what is the question.
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.162,1275.151,But do you think that’s equivalent to the lack of power in the District Court.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1279.054,1283.458,I don’t think that there any officer of the United States has authority to waive the sovereign immunity of the --
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.458,1284.623,"Congress, Congress may --"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1284.623,1294.067,"Congress has power to, and the only place that I know of that Congress has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to suits against United States."
1972.71-6742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.332,1337.771,But they allege it under 46 (a) (2) which is the one you're reading.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1339.294,1352.354,"Yes, I understand and I'm trying to narrow it down and say that this case is solely and simple a case under the Tucker Act, Section 1346 (a) (2)."
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.652,1483.922,And of course they expressly allege that each claim is based on an Act of Congress?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1483.922,1490.477,"Yes, Mr. Justice I understand that and so that gets us down to -- there is also a lot of other things that will --"
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.477,1491.664,I mean in that respect.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1494.406,1499.76,That is within the -- that is within the Tucker Act but the Act of Congress is Section 1821.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1499.76,1500.807,Yes.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1500.807,1548.141,"And so we are now confronted with the problem of construing Section 1821 and my opponent contends that the proper construction of that is that it provides for a per diem of $21.00 per day to the detained witness and this Court can of course make a statute mean anything it feels that it ought to mean, but I find it extraordinarily difficult to find that that is either the literal proper construction of the statute or that it is the construction of the statute which can be supported in terms of its history or the practice under it."
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1561.595,1564.02,Before you proceed Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1570.332,1570.418,"Yes, Mr. Justice --"
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.418,1571.364,That’s outside the party?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1571.364,1575.856,"But if it is unconstitutional, I find no basis for sustaining a --"
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1575.856,1577.058,That’s what I want to ask you.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1581.125,1582.288,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.978,1614.101,"It doesn’t help any of the -- it doesn’t help any in this respect if he says, “Denying me compensation when the statute gives compensation to somebody else, denies me for protection of the law and in order to remedy my denial, or you must pay me.”"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1614.101,1623.205,"I have one little trouble that Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause, that’s a problem with the Court has wrestled with and in --"
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.205,1623.698,If it did --
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1623.698,1625.276,-- various circumstances.
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.764,1639.808,But assuming that he won on his equal protection argument.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1652.641,1653.629,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1655.552,1657.309,That was the purpose of my question at this point.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1657.309,1663.992,But I would not agree that was the solution or analysis.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1666.638,1667.614,Yes.
1972.71-6742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.614,1675.493,"You don’t think then Mr. Solicitor General that the Tucker Act is, when it refers to Constitution, speaks only of the eminent domain or condonation?"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1675.493,1696.536,"No, I don’t see how it can be limited solely to that although that of course was -- is I suppose a large part of the basis of upon which suits under the Constitution are brought either in District Courts for less than $10,000.00 or in the Court of Claims for greater sums."
1972.71-6742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1696.536,1713.559,"So the upshot is as I understand the theorizing of my brothers at the other end of the bench, that if he prevails on the statutory claim on the construction of statute, he gets $21.00 a day and if he prevails on the constitutional claim he gets $20.00."
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1713.559,1714.654,He gets $20.00 a day.
1972.71-6742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.45,1721.553,Yes.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1721.553,1732.382,-- equality is required despite the basis for proper classification which I would like to put before the Court.
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.382,1740.224,That is his question I think (Inaudible)
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1740.224,1803.417,"It seems to me not irrelevant that all of the named plaintiffs in this case and far as anything appears and I don’t understand class actions, particularly as applied to this sort of a situation, as far as it appeared with respect to the numerous people who are said to be of the same class involved, but of all the named plaintiffs in this case are people who illegally enter the United States, who were arrested together with the people who bought them into the United States, who were under the benign policy of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, treated very gently as illegal immigrants, but whose services were wanted for the purpose of proceeding against those who were apparently engaged in the business of bringing a Mexicans into the United States illegally."
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.038,1959.892,"During that interval the statute was not interpreted to mean that people incarcerated got the $20.00 too, I think not --"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1959.892,1965.787,"Mr. Justice, I do not know but I don’t think so."
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.38,2062.179,"Mr. Solicitor General, you may resume whenever you’re ready."
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2062.179,2084.172,"Insofar as this case turns under the Tucker Act on the construction of a statute and we have referred primarily to Section 1821, but I have also mentioned the corresponding immigration statute, Title 8 Section 1227 (d)."
1972.71-6742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.663,2213.165,"Mr. Solicitor General, my reading of the appendix on page 3 indicates that on April 8th the District Court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment which would be the Government I take it."
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2223.578,2241.785,"Mr. Justice, I -- here again, I m not wholly clear but there were joint motions for summary judgment and when the matter is before the Court on joint motion for summary judgment that is on the ground that there is no material issue of fact in either way."
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2363.41,2370.506,"Their convictions I take it followed the events we’re talking about, did they?"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2370.506,2370.852,No.
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2370.852,2371.607,They were not under conviction while they were being held?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2371.607,2386.952,"No, Mr. Chief Justice the dates are stated on pages 8, 9, and 10, but the chronology is a little, certainly too difficult for me to keep in mind --"
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2386.952,2394.371,"But if they were, under my point that I'm driving at is, if they were under the sentence it could’ve been held without any question of reason --"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2394.371,2399.161,They were under the sentence and it could have been held except that the sentence granted immediate probation.
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.161,2401.02,"I see, but it could’ve done otherwise that --"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2401.02,2420.389,It could have done otherwise and was I am sure done as a part of the process by which they were dealt with and then held until the people who introduced them into the United States came to trial which in one case was about six weeks later and in another case was about a month.
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.389,2427.849,"If the sentence had not been suspended until after these events, you wouldn’t be here on this case today?"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2427.849,2434.247,"There wouldn’t be any problem of -- as to this, except conceivably under the Bail Reform Act."
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.097,2442.024,I'm speaking of the after trial period.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2456.095,2460.506,After the trial there would have been no problem about that at all.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2460.506,2477.527,"Probably of that because it was on March 26th, when apparently they pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor which was although six months imprisonment and then suspended and supervised probation for one year, and that same day, they were committed as material witnesses."
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2483.57,2484.138,Yes.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.138,2495.969,"You say -- you said page seven that was on the 26th of they pleaded, these petitioners pleaded guilty and got a six months execution which was suspended that they were put on probation for one year?"
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2495.969,2496.711,That’s right.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2496.711,2501.893,Then on next page it says on that day they were committed as material witness on the same day.
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2501.893,2503.775,On the same day as executed.
1972.71-6742,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.368,2527.07,But did you know this is quite right if it haven’t been that suspension the right of having a sentence --
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2527.07,2530.479,If there hadn’t been a suspension there would be any problem.
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.491,2707.425,If you maybe detained as a prisoner?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2707.425,2709.173,Maybe detained as a visitor?
1972.71-6742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.173,2710.725,As a prisoner?
1972.71-6742,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2710.725,2712.02,"As a prisoner, yes."
1972.71-6742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2885.06,2887.981,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2888.906,2893.101,If Court please if I may respond.
1972.71-6742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.858,2921.75,Pleaded?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2921.75,2922.353,"What, sir?"
1972.71-6742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.353,2925.78,Was it required?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2925.78,2926.97,I would say yes.
1972.71-6742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.97,2928.384,You have the burden of course?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2928.384,2928.742,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.299,2933.926,"Then, you have the burden of showing the speculation, but the invidious speculation."
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2933.926,2954.9,"Invidious and I think that -- the point to that I'm making is that they resorted to 201 which is something all of this argument that counsel has made is subject to a motion to strike because they have added to this record in a rule that doesn’t come into effect till July 1, 1973."
1972.71-6742,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.951,2986.45,What did you say the Government has added?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,2986.45,2999.676,"They have added all of these business about the -- that they were in -- that they were charged, that they had six months given to them, that they were granted voluntary departure."
1972.71-6742,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2999.676,3001.322,But that you make some rules that you said --
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3001.322,3021.625,"Yes sir, they have added, on page 31 of, excuse me let me find it in -- on page -- they make a statement in their brief and I’ll find it in a minute."
1972.71-6742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.045,3051.842,"There aren’t in these federal rules yet, are they?"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3051.842,3052.637,"No, sir."
1972.71-6742,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3054.109,3056.467,"This is just a reference C, I don’t --"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3056.467,3062.196,"No, the point that I'm making Your Honor is so that --"
1972.71-6742,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3062.196,3066.518,They recite that is expressing the prevailing practice as I read?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3068.139,3072.115,"Well, they do because they have added a -- the whole addendum --"
1972.71-6742,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3072.115,3073.751,"Well, I will don’t waste your time."
1972.71-6742,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.751,3075.767,"But the matter of law material is not the record, that’s the point?"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3075.767,3077.112,Precisely.
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.494,3091.52,But do you say that we cannot judicially notice the records of the United States’ District Court.
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3099.098,3110.93,"Your Honor, in the -- in this Dandridge case, this Court established clearly the right of this Court to establish judicial, through judicial notice."
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.02,3170.208,"But you’ve come now -- there’s quite a difference between a classification that differs between the generality of the citizens and aliens who've been found guilty of illegally entering the country and had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for that purpose, even though that sentence was suspended."
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3173.877,3175.105,Precisely.
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.822,3260.427,What is the maximum money fine that could be imposed on an alien in these circumstances illegally and --
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3260.427,3276.539,"If it’s a -- Your Honor, the statute Title 8, 1325 and 1326 categorized these things as felonies and misdemeanors which is that the discretion of the --"
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3276.539,3277.701,"Yes, but how much is the most --"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3277.701,3278.426,$500.00
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3278.426,3279.173,$500.00
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3279.173,3279.948,And six months in jail.
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3279.948,3281.081,"So, what's your suggesting --"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3281.081,3281.398,No.
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.033,3291.075,"No, I'm speaking of these plaintiffs right here, that your petitioners there."
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3294.216,3299.966,$500.00 and six months in jail is the maximum for each offense.
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.966,3315.658,"So, that if the judge had fined them $500.00 and six months then he could take -- if you're right on your argument you could -- the Government could nevertheless take the $20.00 a day out of that $500.00, couldn’t they, as an offset?"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3315.658,3319.849,"It would seem to me sir that that might be one of the solutions to the problem, yes?"
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3319.849,3325.174,"Well, now you’re suggesting a premium on judges to impose the maximum sentence in every case?"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3325.174,3325.845,"No, sir."
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3377.242,3384.808,"But in the cases we’re dealing with, they did not fall because there were verdicts or there were judgments of guilty by some process?"
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3384.808,3385.714,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3432.446,3439.622,What was the lapse of time between when they were convicted and that’s how long were they held as witnesses after they were detained?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3439.622,3447.936,"Well, two of them where held almost 90 days sir, but we have some that were held six months, some of them nine months, they put them in jail and threw away the keys."
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3447.936,3449.405,The named petitioners?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3449.405,3450.054,Sir?
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3450.054,3452.289,Some of the named petitioners?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3452.289,3452.877,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3471.54,3477.211,Are you asking for $20.00 a day for the whole time or just the time after the conviction?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3477.211,3478.991,"No, for the time after the conviction."
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3479.114,3479.96,That’s all you’re asking?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3479.96,3481.048,That’s all we’re asking for.
1972.71-6742,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3482.777,3485.225,That’s not the way I read your complaint?
1972.71-6742,2,15433,albert_armendariz_sr,,3485.536,3487.51,"Well, that’s what we meant."
1972.71-6742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3542.601,3545.476,"Very well, thank you Mr. Armendariz."
1972.71-6742,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3546.377,3556.45,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases, I would lodge this submission to the Budget Bureau with the clerk so that the clerk will have the information available."
1972.71-6742,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3556.45,3559.935,"That measure wouldn’t have passed, wouldn’t affect this case, would it?"
1972.71-6742,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3559.935,3560.52,"No, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-6742,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3560.52,3561.41,It's not that corrective?
1972.71-6742,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3561.41,3563.926,"No, I assume that it would get -- well, it could be made if --"
1972.71-6742,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3563.926,3564.809,Made as proposed?
1972.71-6742,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3564.809,3573.47,"It could be made retroactive but the proposal is simply prospective and whether anything will come of this, I have no idea."
1972.71-6742,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3573.47,3576.111,"Very well, thank you Mr. Solicitor General."
