1983.82-914,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.197,We'll hear arguments next in Monsanto Company against Spray-Rite Service Corporation.
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,13.15,16.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,135.46,146.016,"Mr. Bartlit, you're not suggesting, are you, that the only evidence before the Court of Appeals were complaints from distributors plus the fact of termination by Monsanto?"
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,146.016,147.886,"No, Justice Rehnquist, I'm not."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.909,597.921,"Well, I mean he was terminated because he was a price cutter, was he not?"
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,597.921,598.412,--No.
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.592,609.269,"Well, now... now, let me call your attention to page in your petition for writ of certiorari A-17, which is part of the Court of Appeals finding."
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,622.298,628.801,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist, there was evidence from which a jury could have concluded that that was at least part of Monsanto's motives."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.605,635.035,But it is sufficient to find the reason why Monsanto terminated.
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,635.035,636.126,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.463,647.784,"Well, but you... you can't argue that here after--"
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,647.784,648.765,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.765,650.596,--A jury finding affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,650.596,651.027,I can't.
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.156,846.474,But are you suggesting a different standard of proof for the element of a conspiracy in a case like this than we ordinarily have for facts to be found by a jury?
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,846.474,848.715,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.473,879.934,"Well, but this Court is not ordinarily a finder of fact."
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,893.474,905.272,"Justice Rehnquist, we took the position that there wasn't sufficient evidence to submit the question of a vertical resale price fixing conspiracy to the jury on this case."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.78,928.578,"Well, when you say ""normal marketplace evidence"", that doesn't necessarily to me, from what little I know about the market, negate the possibility of a conspiracy."
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,928.578,931.91,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-914,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.344,956.177,That's typical of lots of mixed motive findings of fact.
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,964.692,968.482,"Justice Blackmun, the programs were put into effect over a period of time."
1983.82-914,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,970.465,975.558,"Well, specifically, did they go into effect before or after Spray-Rite's termination?"
1983.82-914,0,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,975.558,981.021,"--Some went into effect before, and some went in in 1968 simultaneous with the termination."
1983.82-914,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.24,1107.797,Mr. Baxter.
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1107.797,1111.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-914,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1497.601,1504.965,"You're not then suggesting an abandonment of the per se rule in all circumstances, Mr. Baxter."
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1504.965,1505.486,No.
1983.82-914,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.724,1532.003,"And if we were to follow what you're arguing today, what precisely would be the evidentiary proof that it would take to get to a jury?"
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1532.003,1538.127,"Well, it would depend, Justice O'Connor, on the characteristics of the case."
1983.82-914,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1621.432,1629.497,Could evidence of uniform retail prices constitute evidence of an explicit agreement then?
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1629.497,1640.584,"I think it could under extreme circumstances, but uniform pricing is at best circumstantial evidence, and often it is not very probative."
1983.82-914,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.584,1649.179,"Well, how is a district judge to know whether there are extreme circumstances where he should let a case with uniform prices go to the jury?"
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1649.179,1655.574,"Well, that is a problem, of course, we have faced for many years in the area of horizontal agreements."
1983.82-914,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.892,1703.014,"Mr. Baxter, what about this case?"
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1704.935,1707.947,"I have no personal opinion on that, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-914,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.411,1716.102,"Isn't the issue before us... isn't that the issue before us, whether there's enough evidence--"
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1716.102,1717.975,"--Oh, no, I don't believe it is at all, sir."
1983.82-914,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.868,1762.434,"--Mr. Baxter, had Congress not adopted the proviso in its appropriation act, would you have made possibly a different argument to us today?"
1983.82-914,1,43843,william_f_baxter,,1762.434,1767.657,"We have not withdrawn part 2(b) of our brief, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-914,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.233,1780.796,Mr. Foote.
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,1780.796,1785.518,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.896,2114.015,"Well, Mr. Foote, is it your position that Monsanto could not unilaterally discontinue the respondent here because of dissatisfaction with his price activities, his price cutting?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2114.015,2122.831,"Under Colgate, Your Honor, as counsel, all of us agree, you can unilaterally do about anything in this field."
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.415,2427.851,"Well, it's your position then that the evidence showed that the price stabilization wasn't just a unilateral act of Monsanto."
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2427.851,2428.4,Absolutely.
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.4,2430.773,But it was pushed on them really by some of the dealers?
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2430.773,2431.722,Some of the dealers loved it.
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.673,2471.619,"Yeah, but where did the impetus, the first impetus, according to the evidence in this case, for the price stabilization come from, from Monsanto or from the dealer?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2471.619,2474.301,I think originally it came from the dealers.
1983.82-914,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2538.972,2540.592,"Mr. Foote, could I ask you--"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2540.592,2540.943,Yes.
1983.82-914,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2540.943,2550.72,--I think there's some confusion in the briefs as to exactly when the last dealer complaint took place prior to termination of Spray-Rite.
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2550.72,2568.913,"Well, I think Mr. Stein testified in the summer of 1968 that he reviewed in the district office in St. Louis a number of complaints because it was the attitude at that time of the management in St. Louis that they continuously get complaints."
1983.82-914,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2597.721,2602.323,So it is your opinion that 15 months did not elapse between the last--
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2602.323,2602.834,That is correct.
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.147,2737.232,"--Well, but Petitioner isn't obligated to make the same arguments here that he made in the Seventh Circuit."
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2741.514,2752.673,"Well, I've got to concede that Mr. Bartlit is a sensible counsel, Your Honor, so I suppose he would want to go beyond it."
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.335,2881.347,Do you have a corresponding citation to the appendix to the petition?
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2885.33,2888.352,"--I do not handily, I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2992.788,2998.982,And is that a question of fact in each case whether the non-price restrictions are tied to the price restrictions?
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,2998.982,3002.425,I don't think so.
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.667,3012.581,"Well, but the court can instruct the jury... in fact, it usually does instruct the jury on questions of fact."
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3012.581,3028.221,"Oh, but in setting the standard the court has to tell the jury to what extent in each case, as was done in this case, the jury has to be instructed, as they were, that unilateral actions are not unlawful."
1983.82-914,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.221,3033.885,"Yeah, but I'm just going to quote a sentence from Judge Bower's opinion, referring to the Sealy court:"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3054.871,3062.465,"Well, if I wanted to preserve this point and it was January of 1980, I would tell Judge Roskowski put it up alternatively."
1983.82-914,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.984,3095.378,"Well, Mr. Foote, isn't it true that the second special interrogatory is directed at precisely this issue?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3095.378,3096.349,--It is.
1983.82-914,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3159.769,3164.471,Is it your point they didn't need to analyze it under the instruction?
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3164.471,3165.643,--They weren't asked to.
1983.82-914,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.643,3169.155,Then what's the answer to my question?
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3169.155,3172.268,"Pardon me, Chief Justice."
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3502.052,3509.145,"Counsel, what was the evidence that showed the agreement or conspiracy?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3509.145,3515.259,The evidence that showed the agreement or conspiracy starts with substantial complaints.
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3517.623,3522.235,Was there more than evidence of competitor complaints--
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3522.235,3522.926,"Oh, yes."
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3522.926,3523.417,--By the--
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3523.417,3524.536,Substantially more.
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3524.536,3525.567,--Distributor complaints.
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3526.488,3533.833,"It started historically with distributor complaints, some of whom requested that we do something about this."
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3546.571,3555.808,"Well, what I'm asking is what was the evidence of a conspiracy or agreement other than the complaints by the distributors, in a nutshell?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3555.808,3573.018,"--Monsanto reacted to those complaints, went about to stabilize prices by either telling dealers such as Yapp that they should increase their suggested... increase their prices to the suggested price that the other dealers wanted, or they'd terminate them."
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3577.36,3585.476,"Well, so the evidence was, as the other side has suggested, simply the complaints of distributors followed by the termination."
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3585.476,3588.378,"That is plain nonsense, I respectfully suggest, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3588.378,3590.329,"Well, then, what else?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3590.329,3598.804,After that they had a... they adopted a wholesale stabilization plan for the entire product Lasso.
1983.82-914,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3645.545,3653.352,"Well, that market... the... the Lasso product came on line after the termination?"
1983.82-914,2,22300,edward_l_foote,,3653.352,3656.184,--It was announced almost at the same time.
1983.82-914,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3694.321,3697.293,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3701.324,3702.316,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-914,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.316,3705.959,You have three minutes remaining.
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3705.959,3707.278,Sir.
1983.82-914,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3772.601,3778.084,"Mr. Bartlit, can I ask you exactly what disposition you think the Court should make of the case?"
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3778.084,3778.975,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-914,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3789.151,3792.834,"But what about the boycott evidence, the post-termination evidence?"
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3792.834,3794.266,"Your Honor, the--"
1983.82-914,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3794.266,3796.107,"You didn't even challenge that, if I--"
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3796.107,3796.798,"--No, sir, I didn't."
1983.82-914,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3814.729,3820.113,"--I thought you had a footnote on your brief that said that there were three elements of damage, and we couldn't unscramble them, and that's why--"
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3820.113,3822.564,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-914,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3826.146,3831.15,"--So you say as a matter of law, there's no evidence in the record of damages flowing from the boycott."
1983.82-914,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,3831.15,3831.821,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-914,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3845.94,3846.29,"Thank you, gentlemen."
