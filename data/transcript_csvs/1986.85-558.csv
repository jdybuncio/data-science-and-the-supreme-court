1986.85-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.712,"We'll hear argument first today in: No. 85-558, Robert E. O'Connor versus the United States; No. 85-559, Paul H. Coplin versus the United States; No. 85-560, Jack Maddox versus the United States."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,22.363,25.965,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.539,278.128,"Mr. Phillips, could I ask you about the language of the implementation agreement itself, which I suppose is where we need to start."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,278.128,279.663,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.663,294.507,"Under your view of it, U.S. employees are exempt from taxes by any government on income received from their work for the Commission."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,294.507,295.09,That's correct.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.09,302.327,And likewise from payment of taxes on income derived from sources outside Panama.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,302.327,303.279,That's correct.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.279,313.468,"But I gather under your view, if there were outside income from sources within Panama there is no exemption and both governments can tax?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,313.468,322.507,"Well, our view is that the way to read the second sentence is to incorporate by the language ""similarly"", which is what precedes... which is what initiates the second sentence."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.298,340.619,So I gather if there were income earned within Panama that wasn't earned from the Commission work--
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,340.619,341.286,--Right.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.286,344.773,"--both governments could tax that, I suppose?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,344.773,347.173,"I supposed they could, although I don't know that they would."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.173,348.308,"And that's a little bizarre, isn't it?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,348.308,349.808,"Well, not terribly bizarre, Your Honor."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.256,375.656,Perhaps.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,375.656,376.073,--of the Commission.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.073,377.291,But it is an odd result.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,392.984,394.586,Significantly different language with respect to military personnel.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.586,397.121,"Well, remarkably similar, wouldn't you say?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,397.121,397.504,Except for the--
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.504,399.304,What is your position there?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,405.775,412.595,"--Well, it's not easy for me to give a definitive answer on that, because I don't know about the negotiating history that would have led up to that part of the agreement."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.851,423.487,"Well, but the first sentence says:"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,439.579,445.566,"--That's true, Justice O'Connor, but if you read the next sentence, which is the sentence that grounds Article 16 into Panamanian law,"
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.76,473.218,"But do you take the position, if pressed, that military personnel income is taxable by the United States?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,473.218,478.954,My basic position would be that it is clearly a much stronger case for U.S. taxation of the military.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.195,509.306,Is there any other place in the world to your knowledge where the United States has agreed to make income received by United States citizen or military personnel not taxable by the United States?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,509.306,516.559,"Well, the United States has entered into agreements, none of which have been ultimately ratified by the Senate, that would provide for some bilateral exemptions."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.181,551.733,But it isn't just that income that your position addresses.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,563.691,567.226,"Well, I don't believe we have to read the second sentence that broadly."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.226,570.98,I thought you just did in your response to Justice O'Connor.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,570.98,595.079,"I thought in my response to Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, I had indicated that I thought you could incorporate into the second sentence the word ""similarly"" a limitation on the scope of the second sentence referring to income derived from Commission-related work, but from outside sources; and that that's a much narrower and clearly less important provision."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.079,598.631,"That's the weight you're putting on the word ""similarly""?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,598.631,599.514,"Well, I think it follows."
1986.85-558,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.816,610.505,"Well, but Mr. Phillips, if that's the interpretation, then Panama could tax one of these employees' income from dividends bonds in the United States."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,614.826,620.895,"Except that there's no indication that... whine it may be able to as a matter of the treaty, I don't know that Panama has ever attempted to do that."
1986.85-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.895,621.429,Mr. Phillips--
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,621.429,625.347,And I don't know that it was a concern to the United States and the Panamanian negotiators.
1986.85-558,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.347,629.668,"--I imagine it would be a concern to one of these employees, though."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,650.749,667.942,"Well, I think the best example of it would be the annuitants who had worked on the canal prior to the treaty, who were then rehired after the treaty, because their income for work on the canal that they receive as annuitants would be from sources outside."
1986.85-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.54,710.12,"But do you maintain that, even if the construction that you say should be attached to the word ""similarly"" in that sentence would not be adopted, nonetheless it makes some sense to say that these people, if they're earning income from bank deposits in the United States, nonetheless should be not taxable on them?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,710.12,711.304,By whom?
1986.85-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.304,712.304,By the United States.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,712.304,716.939,"As I would understand it, the United States could tax that income, under my interpretation."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.317,747.124,"You say that the United States, under your preferred theory, the United States could tax and Panama could tax income outside, from outside Panama?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,747.124,749.291,Under my preferred theory?
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.291,750.126,Yes.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,750.126,752.945,"Yes, that that was not a serious concern to the Government."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.945,755.48,Why wouldn't that be a serious concern to the Government?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,788.783,795.603,"But Justice Scalia, the problem with the alternative interpretation is that then you have to go back and say, well, what does the first sentence mean?"
1986.85-558,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.479,897.383,"--Mr. Phillips, before you leave the ""similarly"" sentence, refresh my recollection."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,903.101,903.953,In the--
1986.85-558,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.953,906.786,"In the blue briefs, the Appellee's brief?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,906.786,909.255,"--No, Justice Stevens, it doesn't appear in the blue brief."
1986.85-558,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.171,912.29,It's in your reply brief?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,912.29,919.044,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,989.301,1004.477,"Mr. Phillips, may I ask also whether you concede that the most recently filed document from Panama's minister of foreign relations is authentic?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1004.477,1009.446,The most recently filed document--
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.446,1009.796,Yes.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1009.796,1010.78,--from the official.
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.78,1011.18,Yes.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1011.18,1014.666,"Well, we have never received a copy of it, so it's difficult to make that concession."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1032.211,1036.996,"But you take the position that there is some reason to question its authenticity, do you?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1036.996,1045.702,"Well, I hesitate to say that, because what you have to do is assume that the Government may have been acting to a certain extent in bad faith and I can't do that."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1056.592,1063.313,"Well, I grant you that that's frustrating, but it would be helpful to know whether we have to be concerned with its authenticity in your view."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1063.313,1072.835,"Well, in this instance you're saved the burden of having to worry about that, because even the note under any circumstances, that note cannot serve as a legitimate basis for interpreting the treaty."
1986.85-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1115.679,1133.557,"Well, I guess what I'm getting at is, can we safely assume that right now both parties to the treaty, the United States and Panama, agree that Article 15 does not exempt this income from U.S. taxation?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1133.557,1137.592,"If you take the note at face value, that would seem to be the inference you would draw."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.128,1169.814,I don't know what you mean by
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1174.566,1182.637,"Well, it's just that when a note... no, not any particular reason, other than the circumstances surrounding the note are suspicious."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.72,1185.12,I don't know what you mean.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1187.605,1188.624,"No, no, I don't mean to indicate that."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.624,1189.024,Suspicious--
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1189.024,1191.291,It is an authentic note.
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.945,1198.563,"--Well, it sets forth the Panamanian position."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1204.966,1208.685,"Yes, I think it's absolutely clear that that was not that position."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.685,1211.887,--But you have no doubt that that's the current Panamanian position?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1211.887,1213.489,"As of today, I have no doubt of that."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.935,1274.045,"Well, what if the Government had answered different, had said, yes, we are trying to get a note, and Judge Kozinski said, well, let me know when you get it, and the United States came up with precisely this same note?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1276.897,1278.849,--It would be largely irrelevant.
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.849,1279.332,Largely?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1282.3,1285.502,"Well, it is difficult for me to say completely irrelevant."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.302,1291.072,"Well then, this note we have now is not... is somewhat relevant?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1291.072,1300.362,"--Only in a circumstance where the note clearly supports both the plain meaning of the agreement and the understanding of the United States, as it did in Sumitomo."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.547,1304.147,Then you don't need a note.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1310.736,1328.613,"--Well, as I read the opinion in Sumitomo, the Court said that, even with the understanding of the United States and Japan and the plain meaning, that still didn't end the inquiry in that case, and the Court went on to examine whether or not there was some additional evidence that might justify a different interpretation of the agreement."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.838,1367.988,"Do you... well, what is your position as to whether Panama could have had one interpretation originally and then changed its mind about what the agreement meant?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1369.255,1371.69,"It can do that, but it's not binding on this Court."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.963,1388.402,Would the second position have any force as far as the deliberations of this Court are concerned?
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1388.402,1394.306,"I would think not, not if it's clear that the original understanding of the parties was X."
1986.85-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.408,1398.875,Let's assume it's ambiguous.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1398.875,1416.719,"--Well, this Court has said in a number of instances that simply because on party to the agreement has abandoned the agreement, okay... in Santo Vincenzo, Italy stopped believing that citizens should be extradictable and the United States continued to believe that citizens should be extradictable."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.531,1451.243,"Well, Mr. Phillips, suppose the negotiating history that you rely on here was just to the contrary, that it indicated rather clearly that Panama said: Okay, if you insist we won't tax, but you can."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1458.662,1461.681,I would say I would be in a lot more trouble than I am anyway.
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.681,1471.387,"You mean with that negotiating history, but this language, that you could say this language is ambiguous?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1471.387,1472.239,"No, it's not that it's ambiguous."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.239,1472.922,"Well, what would you say?"
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1472.922,1478.476,It is that the plain meaning of the language in treaty interpretation is never controlling.
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.643,1480.576,"Right, right, right."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1489.951,1493.07,"Well, I would put it slightly differently."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.841,1524.172,"But you would think if the negotiating history supported the views of your opponent and yet they used this language to express their agreement, you would almost think that in between the last meeting and the writing there had been some... something you don't know about."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1524.172,1525.307,"Well, what I would have assumed--"
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.307,1525.774,In your position.
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1525.774,1526.691,--What I would have assumed--
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.691,1530.843,"According to your position, this language really means what it says."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1536.662,1542.233,"--Well, it would have been possible, even if I don't know why, that the Panamanian Government simply decided to recede."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.233,1543.668,"That may have happened here, too."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1543.668,1548.037,"But we have no evidence to that effect, and there is no reason at all to believe it."
1986.85-558,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.88,1565.832,"But in any event, this language is subject to some interpretation."
1986.85-558,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1571.32,1572.003,"Yes, Justice White."
1986.85-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.793,1584.929,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1587.031,1589.447,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.624,1715.13,"Well, the language does say ""from any taxes"", doesn't it?"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1715.13,1717.23,"The first sentence says ""from any taxes""."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.765,1720.532,No.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1720.532,1722.215,And it doesn't say
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.067,1725.2,"No, exactly."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1725.2,1735.975,"It says ""from any taxes"", language which was derived... well, which the negotiating history makes clear the only taxes that were discussed were Panamanian taxes."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.742,1742.195,"Well, do you say the negotiating history just isn't subject to the interpretation that your opponent puts on it?"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1742.195,1743.095,"--Oh, absolutely not."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.628,1800.817,"Well, what if we interpreted the negotiating history contrary with your view of it and consistent with your opponent's?"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1801.984,1806.638,"Well, my first answer would be to disagree with that conclusion."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.336,1832.769,"Well, yes, but stick to the question."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1832.769,1834.955,--And Panama has never disagreed with that.
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.955,1836.005,Just stick to the question.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1851.917,1856.535,"Well, I would still insist that the language be interpreted that way, because in fact even if--"
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.535,1859.587,"And say, well, put the negotiating history aside, here is--"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1859.587,1873.78,"--Well, I wouldn't say put it aside, but we would then have an additional factor, namely the consistent position of the United States, the administrative practice in the years since the treaty was ratified, and the absence of any objection from Panama."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.567,1885.154,"--Just as a practical matter, that's just the way the treaty has operated from the beginning."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1885.154,1887.09,It would be the interpretation.
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.029,1900.748,"You've always withheld, ever since the treaty was signed?"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1900.748,1903.016,"That's correct, and--"
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.016,1905.302,No objection from Panamanians?
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1905.302,1909.77,--No objection from Panama whatsoever.
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.946,1947.109,"Mr. Ganzfried, as long as you're interrupted, as I understand it the United States Government in the proceedings below took the position that the Court need not consider the official view of Panama on the question, and indeed that it would be inappropriate to do so."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1947.109,1958.184,"--Well, the position in the Claims Court, which was prior to the time that the Panamanian Government had expressed its views, was that the United States saw no need to go to Panama."
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.184,1960.286,And that it would be inappropriate to do so.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1960.286,1962.669,It would certainly be inappropriate for the Claims Court--
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.669,1964.102,That was the position the Government took?
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1964.102,1971.089,--It would be inappropriate for the Claims Court to direct the Government to go there or to rule in this case contrary to the Government's position.
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.089,1976.31,"Well, as I understood the argument, also inappropriate to even consider the Panamanian view."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1976.31,1976.66,Basically--
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.66,1977.595,And now all of a sudden--
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1977.595,1979.912,"--Basically, that there was no need to consider the Panamanian view."
1986.85-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1979.912,1982.647,--the Government presents this last minute Panamanian view.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1984.915,1991.002,"Well, it is appropriate that you consider it because it is the official view of the Panamanian Government."
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1995.223,1997.24,Why all of a sudden does it exist?
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1997.24,1997.89,Excuse me?
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1997.89,2000.758,Why does it exist all of a sudden?
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2005.579,2013.102,The State Department has advised us that the United States did not request a note from the Panamanian Government.
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2013.102,2020.022,"Well, of course, the opposition is suspicious to the contrary."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2020.022,2021.039,The opposition is suspicious.
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2021.039,2024.741,"And feels, I suppose, that it's a quid for a quo--"
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2024.741,2025.057,There is no basis--
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2025.057,2027.443,"--actually, to wit the grant in aid."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2027.443,2028.659,"--Well, that's nonsense."
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2044.737,2056.712,"All I'm suggesting is that there's a little bit of stickiness in the case when representations were made to the Claims Court, Judge Kozinski, and then all of a sudden the Government turns over and produces a note."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2056.712,2060.33,The note had... the note simply didn't exist when?
1986.85-558,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2061.964,2065.9,What I'm saying is I think the case isn't as clear as you would make it out to be.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2065.9,2066.784,"Well, I think it is."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.52,2100.639,It's your view that it's always been the view of the Panamanian Government.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2103.007,2104.507,The Panamanian Government has never said anything to the contrary.
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.507,2115.231,"--from the outset, that's what the parties understood this treaty to mean, and they didn't object to your withholding taxes."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2115.231,2116.931,They didn't object to our withholding taxes.
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.931,2121.634,And that this note represents exactly what the Panamanians have thought all along.
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2121.634,2122.584,Precisely.
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.936,2130.84,"I don't know why you didn't say in the Claims Court: Well, this is also the view of the Panamanian Government."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2130.84,2134.876,"--Well, we didn't have an official statement from the Panamanian Government to that effect."
1986.85-558,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.513,2145.184,"Well, I would have thought you'd have said, well, we know what their view is and it's consistent with ours, why don't we ask them."
1986.85-558,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2145.184,2160.027,"Well, I think I should get back to one of the premises here, and that is that the issue of United States taxation or exemption from United States taxation was never a part of the discussions leading up to the treaty and the implementation agreements."
1986.85-558,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3413.634,3416.086,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a couple points."
