1986.85-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,We will hear arguments next in Cargill v. Monfort.
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,50.266,53.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,178.698,184.0,"How does any... under your approach, how does any merger damage competition, or could it ever?"
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,184.0,191.022,"An acquisition... if you mean competitors as opposed to competition, it can indeed."
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.641,195.824,"Well, I know."
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,197.16,202.829,An acquisition can harm competition by so significantly increasing concentration--
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,202.829,204.613,That what?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,204.613,208.717,--and raising entry barriers as to make the market perform less competitively.
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,208.717,210.967,"Well, that may be so."
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,213.185,227.529,"In the event that an acquisition had those effects, the standard effects predicted by Section 7 horizontal merger analysis, consumers, large-scale consumers particularly, would have an interest in preventing the acquisition."
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.214,236.951,But no... it would never... nobody in the same trade level could sue?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,238.487,246.073,--The usual consequences of a horizontal acquisition is to diminish competition.
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.025,250.708,But it wouldn't hurt a competitor?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,250.708,252.393,It would not hurt a competitor.
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.393,254.059,Would it ever?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,257.911,263.332,There are kinds of horizontal acquisitions that we believe could hurt a competitor.
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.986,269.736,That what?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,269.736,280.376,"--they raise a credible threat, a genuine threat, of predatory activity, then, if the market circumstances are such as to give some palpable basis--"
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.376,284.864,You mean predatory activity like lowering prices to drive somebody else out of business?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,284.864,286.697,--Genuinely predatory conduct.
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.268,294.684,So it almost has to be monopolization?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,294.684,306.076,"--As a practical matter, predation is impossible unless the firm, the would-be predator, has at least close to a dominant market position."
1986.85-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.076,308.943,"It also requires an intent, does it not?"
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,308.943,309.46,"Well, of course."
1986.85-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.12,326.739,xxx cause of action on a competitor?
1986.85-473,0,39018,ronald_g_carr,,326.739,340.582,--Consumers are directly injured by any sort of significantly increased concentration in the market that gives rise to the possibility of oligopolistic conduct.
1986.85-473,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1251.025,1261.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
