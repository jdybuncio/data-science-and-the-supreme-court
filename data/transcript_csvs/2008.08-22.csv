2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.715,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-22, Caperton v. Massey Coal Company."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,7.963,17.818,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a fundamental constitutional right."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,27.783,28.704,Who says?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,30.034,34.234,"--You have said that in the Murchison case and in a number of other cases, Your Honor."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,34.234,36.125,A guarantee against even--
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,36.125,40.653,"Yes, the language of the Murchison case specifically says so."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.036,62.021,"--""Has always endeavored""."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,62.021,63.347,--Pardon?
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.347,64.315,"""Has always endeavored""."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,65.878,66.86,"Yes, but that's--"
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.86,69.968,And there are rules in the States that do endeavor to do that.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,69.968,79.214,"--But the Court has said that frequently, not only the probability of bias, the appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent suspicion of bias."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,83.866,85.134,"""Probability"" is a loose term."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,88.116,88.771,Well--
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.771,96.203,"If you've a 50 percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance, probable means more than 50?"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,96.203,100.111,"--It's probable cause, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-22,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,127.973,132.067,Does it mean the same thing as likelihood of bias?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,132.067,136.907,"--The Court -- the Court, Justice Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.829,179.64,And you claim that there is such a temptation here because of gratitude?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,179.64,180.373,"--Well, it's--"
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.373,181.81,You've been around Washington a long time.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,187.153,208.706,"--Well, let me put it this way, Justice Scalia: If -- an ordinary person would say that it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million to his election."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.706,223.793,"Yes, but that -- that person contributed money to my election because he expected me to be a fair and impartial judge, and I would be faithful to that contributor only by being a fair and impartial judge."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,247.627,252.86,"Well, I would go back to the words of this Court in the Tumey case, the seminal case."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.545,263.339,--This isn't a matter of honor and sacrifice.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,286.642,288.08,"Well, it's not clear."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.751,290.034,They're certainly not good buddies.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,290.034,294.717,"--We're not claiming that there is a basis based upon personal relationship, Your Honor."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.717,308.665,"And his contributions, as I understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that -- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in favor of the plaintiffs' bar."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,328.939,337.074,"Well, if I can address part of the premise of your question and invite the Court to look at page 188a of the joint appendix."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,413.013,419.042,"What if, instead of having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade group that's making the donation."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,424.821,439.845,"I think that -- I think the answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but -- but this is -- like your cases involving reasonable search and seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the complex of circumstances."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.845,448.514,"Well, let's just take this case, the same amount of money, except it's not from an individual, not from that individual's company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up by ten."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,448.514,475.284,"I think the Court would -- a reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a party to the case, who is not personally involved in having a personal stake in the election or the outcome of that particular case, but may be interested in a panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a certain way; that would not give rise to what you're concerned about here."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,475.284,476.177,"Well, okay."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,488.765,496.965,"If those are the companies that are a party to the case, if it's when their case is pending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude--"
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,496.965,497.901,"Well, could I stop you right there?"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,505.804,507.068,"--No, I think that that--"
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,507.068,508.663,"Well, then we shouldn't talk about pending cases."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,508.663,509.1,"--Well, no."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,536.152,540.024,"Well, but that's the whole distinction that your friend on the other side makes."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,555.5,564.516,"--Well, I would submit that your cases say that when a judge has an interest in the case and that interest leads to the likelihood of--"
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.516,566.108,"No, they don't say that."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,566.108,566.56,--Yes.
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.56,570.607,"There are only two categories of cases, only two categories."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,606.561,611.935,"Well, let me -- let me answer that in -- there's more parts, there's more than one part to that question."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.817,629.549,Two categories are the only categories in which it has applied that.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,629.549,629.958,--I respectfully--
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.958,630.363,That broad--
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,630.363,636.344,"--I respectfully submit, Justice Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't have a personal financial interest."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.906,678.514,"--Nice, clear, and true."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,681.731,682.574,And I was going to--
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.574,687.557,And he had a lot of -- a lot of issues coming before me while his presidency continued.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,687.557,701.288,"--In the first place, there's a -- there is a significant difference with respect to the Framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.951,726.9,What about the United Mine Workers?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,749.049,750.781,"No, Chief Justice Roberts."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.781,754.735,Or are those all factors and circumstances we have to look at?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,754.735,766.916,"Well, of course, there are factors and circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual or a group of individuals makes contributions in the context of elections -- and we are going to have State elections of -- of judges."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,790.486,803.698,"Well, so if there's a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even United Mine Workers, involving particular union members, and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that -- that judge is recused?"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,803.698,811.351,--I can't -- I can't rule out a situation where there is a potential litigant who has a stake in front of a case.
2008.08-22,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.317,828.221,"Well, then, my -- my question in this case is this: In your petition for certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came here you would have a standard for us that we can work with."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,874.232,874.887,It would be--
2008.08-22,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.887,894.052,"But your -- your standard of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give sufficient -- or ""unacceptable risk of bias"" doesn't give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this rule, unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,901.988,904.952,"--Well, there are several answers to that."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.728,923.572,Was their standard the same as yours?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,923.572,923.962,--It's--
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.962,924.742,"I mean, that's frankly--"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,924.742,925.101,--Yes.
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.101,925.729,--one of the problems in this case.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,941.174,941.751,That's--
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.751,942.141,Right?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,942.141,957.181,"--That's because, Justice Scalia, the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection with standards like due process or probable cause or speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down with levels of specificity."
2008.08-22,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.18,970.88,"I want you to articulate some substandards that have -- that are general in nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are more specific than the probability of bias."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,970.88,979.829,"--Well, I -- I -- the reason we -- we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy, is the probability of bias is something that this Court has said repeatedly."
2008.08-22,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.803,1007.365,To what--
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1007.365,1008.773,--the Conference of Chief Justices--
2008.08-22,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.773,1027.606,--To what extent do you rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the plaintiff?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1064.515,1067.857,"--It is very much central, but it's not exclusively central."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.237,1094.627,Counsel--
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1094.627,1096.453,That is a central factor.
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.625,1099.751,But not the only central factor.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1099.751,1100.422,--It's not--
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.422,1101.67,You said it's one central factor.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1101.67,1102.091,"--Well, that's--"
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.091,1105.23,You really have no test other than probability of bias.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1110.26,1121.007,"--I submit, Justice Scalia, you're going to have to wipe out a lot of jurisprudence from this Court that uses terms like ""appearance of bias"", ""likelihood of bias""."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.678,1141.827,Not -- not for situations that have such an infinite variety as -- as the appointment of judges and the election of judges and -- and funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund or joining some agglomeration of -- of other institutions that fund.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1151.697,1167.393,"--Well, it would be -- it would be -- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50 percent of the contributions in an election, and we would come along in a case where there would be a very small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all of those situations are distinguishable."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.749,1237.677,"Don't you think it would be easier to solve the problem, as some States have done, not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be made?"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1241.534,1244.081,"--Well, the States are perfectly free to do that."
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.58,1245.504,And some of them are doing that.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1245.504,1246.986,"--Let me make this point, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1260.077,1261.902,--Are the States -- are the States really free to do that?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1272.04,1287.47,"--I -- I think that this Court's -- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence acknowledges the appropriateness of campaign contribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia just made, and other limits."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1296.514,1296.92,"Well, this--"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1296.92,1303.717,"--But the -- and -- and the States do have limitations with respect to what litigants can do, but--"
2008.08-22,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.717,1304.075,All right.
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1400.109,1403.279,--I think there are -- there are more than one answer to that question.
2008.08-22,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.603,1416.947,"Oh, I think we all recognize that."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1419.696,1426.489,"--I -- it hasn't done the job so far, and the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but even if it--"
2008.08-22,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1426.489,1428.162,What happened in West Virginia?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1428.162,1428.864,--Pardon me?
2008.08-22,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.864,1434.939,"Is my recollection correct that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of limiting legislation?"
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1434.939,1440.563,"I -- I believe that is correct, but I don't think that would have addressed the problem in this case because--"
2008.08-22,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.563,1441.015,Why?
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1447.433,1454.791,"--Irrespective of that, I was going to go on and answer this in response to Justice Souter's question."
2008.08-22,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1471.346,1478.719,"Well, they propose a seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests."
2008.08-22,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1519.687,1522.043,"--I would hesitate -- I would hesitate to do so, Justice Alito."
2008.08-22,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.565,1585.347,"--Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1595.357,1621.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First of all, just on the West Virginia statutory amendment, they did, as Justice Scalia suggested, close the 527 loophole and limit contributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000 after the 2004 election in response to the concern about the amount of money that was being spent through 527 groups in that election."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.136,1642.838,And how--
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1642.838,1643.29,--not through--
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1643.29,1658.974,"--is it -- is it -- this Court's decision in Republican Party of Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a legislator."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1681.354,1688.025,"--Well, of course I don't agree that Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to anybody in this case."
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.886,1724.978,"Well, Mr. Frey, is it your position that the appearance of impropriety could never be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1724.978,1731.537,"--Well, we might have appearance of impropriety overlapping with conditions that would justify--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.537,1733.755,I'm assuming appearances only.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1741.705,1742.797,--I think we are.
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.797,1744.346,Is that your position?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1744.346,1751.388,We are saying that the Due Process Clause does not exist to protect the integrity or reputation of the State judicial systems.
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.388,1751.84,Why--
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.84,1753.56,That's not an answer to my question.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1753.56,1755.779,"Well, I thought I said--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.779,1772.426,"Supposing, for example, the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our favor in all the cases we're interested in."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1774.878,1775.253,--Well--
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.253,1776.816,Or take another example.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1809.929,1815.49,"--If you were -- if -- if you thought there was no basis for believing there was actual bias, but it looked bad--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.49,1821.487,"No, it would meet the test in the -- in the judges' brief of an average judge would be tempted under the circumstances."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1825.453,1826.452,--That I don't--
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.452,1831.747,"--And do you think that could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due process issue?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1831.747,1834.433,"--No, I don't think just appearance could ever raise a due process issue."
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.433,1835.728,No matter how extreme the facts?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1835.728,1842.4,The question is whether there is actual bias of a kind that is recognized as disqualifying.
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.617,1849.942,The whole point of this case is it has not been recognized -- we have never confronted a case as extreme as this before.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1855.799,1860.421,"--I would take exception to the characterization of this case as ""extreme""."
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.421,1864.592,"I don't think we adopted his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.592,1868.698,"The question is not whether we have, but whether we should."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1868.698,1871.619,I hope to address that question.
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1910.041,1919.116,--What about the view that Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1935.502,1936.141,"Well, that--"
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.141,1940.216,"--wasn't -- well, maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1942.841,1943.979,"--Yes, it challenged the procedure."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1980.592,1983.887,--But it was the position that Blankenship took?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1983.887,1986.604,"Well, it was -- no, not Blankenship."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1989.134,2003.193,"Well, it may not be per se unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system that we have depended on up to this point is not working very well."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2003.193,2008.987,"--Well, I don't think -- I don't think the system -- I don't -- I don't agree that the system is not working well."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.687,2026.793,"Well, I -- as I understand it, although you never directly -- I don't think you ever directly answered it, I -- I understood you to imply in response to Justice Stevens that there would be no appearance problem that would ever justify a constitutional standard."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2026.793,2027.822,"--Yes, but--"
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.822,2028.977,"And in fact, if that's--"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2028.977,2032.148,--but appearances -- but appearances -- I don't mean to interrupt you if -- I'm sorry.
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.148,2032.662,--Go ahead.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2032.662,2044.439,"Appearance is a standard for recusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for recusal in virtually every State, so we already have -- and in the Federal system, so--"
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2044.439,2044.891,Yes.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2058.508,2060.992,"--Well, that -- that's a matter of opinion."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2062.009,2066.319,"Well, it's -- it's the matter of opinion that brings the case before us."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2085.232,2094.044,--I think I would agree that reasonable people could have a different view one way or the other about whether there is an appearance of impropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting.
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.145,2124.687,"I want you to be able to elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance standard has -- has much to recommend it."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2142.679,2148.27,"But -- but we're here on the question of constitutional requirements, and the Constitution--"
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2148.27,2156.035,And we're asking -- but we're asking what substance we can give to the constitutional protection.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2156.035,2178.492,"--Well, what you're really asking is whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly stated rule and practice of the -- of this Court, dating back to the common law, that questions of bias in general as opposed to interest are matters for legislative resolution and not for -- not for constitutional--"
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.492,2184.771,"Of course, the appearance standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable."
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.4,2216.867,"Of course, you can stop at what's obviously improper."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2216.867,2228.784,"--I don't -- I think, first of all, the Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this case an appearance standard."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2230.722,2232.407,Would you please clarify that?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2269.424,2270.001,--All right.
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.108,2326.464,"I -- I think you're quite right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is that the reason -- why is appearance never constitutional?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2330.305,2339.584,"Because it seems to me to be -- if we're talking about appearance as distinct from actual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a rule that says the probability of bias is enough."
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.65,2368.524,Why not?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2368.524,2374.084,Because I think the Due Process Clause is concerned with the fairness of the--
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.084,2378.692,You don't think the community's confidence in the way judges behave is an important part of due process?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2378.692,2384.051,"--No, I think it's -- it may be a systemically important value."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2393.172,2393.64,But--
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.64,2398.951,But our whole system is designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2398.951,2402.964,"Well, I don't -- I think this is a side point."
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.964,2408.259,And it seems -- it seems to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the Due Process Clause.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2408.259,2411.742,"Well, I don't think so, but I don't think it -- I don't think it really essentially matters."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.069,2461.752,"May I ask you -- I mean, there were a few recusal motions in this case."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2491.911,2512.652,"That would raise an interesting question and I think a much closer question than this case, because that would involve the question of whether -- there is -- the Court has recognized that where a judge is embroiled with a litigant and has a personal animosity arising out of the relationship with the litigant, that is -- that is a possible ground for recusal."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.464,2521.634,I thought the animosity was directed at Judge Benjamin?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2521.634,2522.823,"No, no."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.228,2537.816,So you think that the Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you think due process might have been violated if that judge had remained on the bench?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2537.816,2539.22,--I think it's a closer case.
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2541.875,2554.136,"--Mr. Frey, you've tried a couple of times to get to -- to your -- your point that, even if we assume probability of bias is the standard, the debt of gratitude would not qualify."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2570.506,2570.865,Of course.
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2571.208,2572.163,Because that may illustrate the point.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2572.163,2582.718,"Let me say just one point about probability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule is quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that that was not a ground for disqualification of a judge."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2583.327,2587.141,"Well, but I know what common law -- how much help common law is."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2589.184,2590.108,"--No, but--"
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.108,2592.027,Common law did not have this contribution system--
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2592.027,2592.729,"--No, but it had--"
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2592.729,2595.666,--which your colleague referred to as spiraling out of control.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2595.666,2602.353,"--That's the point I wanted to make, that while -- while common law did not have elected judges, it had the issue of bias."
2008.08-22,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2620.469,2623.515,But we don't deal with an abstract setting.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2633.634,2638.322,"Yes, I understand, and the question is whether that -- that gives rise to bias."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.771,2654.018,"I don't take it as the principle, but I take it as an application of the principle."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2660.296,2663.466,--Debt of gratitude I think is a principle.
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.353,2727.614,"May I ask you whether your challenge to the probability of bias as a standard -- do you think it's an unworkable standard or that even if there is a probability of bias, that should not be constitutionally disqualifying?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2727.614,2731.22,"--I think it's an unworkable standard, and -- and I ask the Court to look at--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.22,2735.845,Why is it any more unworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment case?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2735.845,2743.309,"--Well, the Fourth Amendment has reasonableness as a standard, and reasonableness is a--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.309,2744.903,"Well, it has probable cause as a standard."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2744.903,2754.398,"--If there was a standard that said judges should recuse themselves when it would be reasonable to suppose that there was bias, if the Constitution said that, we wouldn't be here today or we would be here arguing about whether--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.398,2755.759,Let me get back to the question.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2763.973,2766.254,--I'm not--
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.254,2767.006,Or is it?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2767.006,2771.331,--I'm not sure of the answer to that.
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.043,2785.964,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not asking you about debt of gratitude."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2794.384,2794.805,"--Well, you could--"
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.805,2796.693,"--that if there is a probability of bias, he ought to get out."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2796.693,2804.472,--You could certainly have a series of cases in which you would -- which you would decide and provide standards.
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.473,2810.049,But we have no choice with regard to the reasonableness standard.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2812.221,2812.907,It's in the Constitution.
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.907,2815.095,--as we would have been making up this one.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2816.701,2817.045,Yes.
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.045,2819.076,"We have to make the most of it, do the best we can do with it."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2831.586,2835.069,"Well, I don't think it's a sensible standard, and as--"
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.069,2839.74,Are you going to finally get to discussing the debt of gratitude point?
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2839.74,2840.082,--Yes.
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.566,2841.316,I've been waiting and waiting.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2842.064,2846.438,"I've been trying to get to it, but I was answering Justice Stevens's question."
2008.08-22,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.468,2887.153,But that isn't the only theory.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3007.402,3010.464,"Well, if you have a -- you have to have a logical principle."
2008.08-22,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.793,3048.714,"A logical principle or, I thought, if I was mentioning, all those things that might lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a single individual, in the fact that there's a case coming up that's likely that the judge will decide -- all those things that are listed by the chief justices in their brief, all those things together make it a serious risk that there will be bias, even though an individual might not be."
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.915,3065.288,"It doesn't matter what language you use because it's pretty vague anyway -- ""probability"", ""likelihood"", ""appearance"" -- it doesn't really--"
2008.08-22,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.288,3066.52,Don't you understand what I mean?
2008.08-22,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.286,3070.926,"Mr. Frey, why don't you take a shot at answering it?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3071.41,3073.379,"--I don't agree with you, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3132.276,3136.212,"How long has Massey been in business, eight years?"
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3137.07,3136.212,A long time.
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3137.787,3138.445,I mean--
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3138.445,3140.224,But you wouldn't--
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3140.224,3147.458,"--If one is going to go into that calculation, one is going to assume that in eight years, there's going to be another three million dollars waiting to be spent."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3147.458,3151.236,"--That -- well, there's several problems with that, Justice Souter."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3158.03,3158.984,"Well, one has hopes."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3159.421,3160.076,--Excuse me?
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3160.076,3161.546,One has hopes.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3161.546,3174.009,"Well, a lot of members of the court would have the same -- exactly the same hopes, and with more reason: They might be running sooner, they might end up with an opponent who is more distasteful to Mr. Blankenship."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3178.552,3181.567,"Well, you say that and I say that because we took corporate law."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3194.252,3203.217,--But why would -- why would Blankenship be more likely to support Benjamin than to support Justice Davis or Justice--
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.217,3205.916,We'll have to see when the next election comes along.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3213.975,3215.664,--Therefore--
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3215.664,3220.082,--and it seems to me that underlies Justice Breyer's analysis just as it does mine.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3220.082,3226.376,--Where that takes you is that all the judges have to recuse themselves because they all have the possibility of garnering support.
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3226.376,3228.36,They all have not had the three million.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3228.36,3240.699,"But either you look to the past or you look at debt of gratitude, and in our brief we have indicated a number of circumstances where the same debt of gratitude rationale would apply."
2008.08-22,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.335,3258.379,"No, but with respect, your -- Justice Breyer dissociated his question from debt of gratitude."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3269.376,3284.213,"--Right, but what I'm saying is you can't -- if you're looking at -- at where -- where would the bias come from, and I'm assuming now that some probability of bias standard is accepted by the Court, and I'm asking where would the bias come from?"
2008.08-22,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3302.83,3307.267,And then debt of gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running out.
2008.08-22,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.406,3314.185,--I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say on debt of gratitude.
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3314.185,3318.607,"Well, okay."
2008.08-22,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.008,3372.849,"Mr. Frey, there is obviously a difference between appointed judges and elected judges."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3396.855,3398.809,--I think you're mixing up two different things.
2008.08-22,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.372,3437.292,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-22,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3437.292,3439.246,Thank you.
2008.08-22,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.246,3440.665,"Mr. Olson, five minutes."
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3440.665,3442.978,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-22,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3547.028,3559.912,What is the difference between this situation and a situation where a justice or a judge is appointed by an executive and then hears a case that is of critical importance to the executive?
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3559.912,3561.976,The -- the -- there's a number of questions.
2008.08-22,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3568.457,3571.926,"If Justice Benjamin were term-limited, would this case be different?"
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3571.926,3578.377,"--No, I think it wouldn't be different because of all of the confluence of circumstances."
2008.08-22,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3582.202,3583.403,"Wait, you can't have it both ways."
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3594.306,3596.057,--He might be running for another court.
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3633.995,3634.541,What about--
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3634.541,3635.867,Ask yourself this question--
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3635.867,3639.303,--What about protective donations?
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3648.693,3654.611,"--As this Court has said, I think, in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to try to game the system in that way."
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.438,3657.938,"--Well, how do you know?"
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3663.436,3666.372,"--It's not going to be clear in every case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.22,3698.029,"Is that a reasonable person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?"
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3698.029,3699.702,That is the standard that this--
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3699.702,3700.185,Okay.
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3706.261,3707.68,"--No, I don't think so."
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3707.68,3708.308,You don't think so?
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3710.086,3711.353,I think--
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3711.353,3719.472,"--they socialize all the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings, whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for recusal."
2008.08-22,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3719.472,3730.111,"--Well, then if it was a basis for a recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time, because that is a standard that's -- reasonable question of impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the State codes."
2008.08-22,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3754.413,3755.305,"Thank you, counsel."
