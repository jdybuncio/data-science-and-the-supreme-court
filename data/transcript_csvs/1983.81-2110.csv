1983.81-2110,0,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,57.26,60.883,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2110,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,311.376,316.549,"But the discrimination is not limited to non-residents, is it?"
1983.81-2110,0,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,316.549,317.992,"No, Justice."
1983.81-2110,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,324.323,325.555,Wherever they live?
1983.81-2110,0,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,325.555,327.365,"Wherever they live, yes."
1983.81-2110,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.295,433.067,"Mr. Kudatzky, suppose the city was, with its own employees, doing a lot of its own construction work, but required that anybody who worked on those jobs be residents of the city."
1983.81-2110,0,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,440.179,442.931,--The City of Philadelphia versus the State of New Jersey?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1289.117,1292.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.783,1482.773,"Would you suggest that Camden could pass an ordinance that said that every contractor performing any construction work in the city, whether for the city or privately, must employ 40 percent Camden residents?"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1482.773,1483.935,"--No, we don't say that."
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.935,1485.325,Why not?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1490.758,1491.199,All right.
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.051,1496.631,Because of Hicklin?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1496.631,1505.467,"Well, yes, because of Hicklin, but because of the far reaching impact of the ripple effect, of course, that Hicklin has established."
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.331,1632.631,Mr. Foster?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1632.631,1633.502,"--Yes, sir."
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.502,1637.994,You said a moment ago that you thought there was no concrete case of controversy here.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1664.861,1671.977,"Your Honor, it was... It worked its way into the New Jersey court system in a very interesting fashion."
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1698.915,1702.127,It could not have become effective without that?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1702.127,1703.817,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.144,1745.955,This was really at the formative stage of the Camden ordinance.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1747.595,1748.727,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1779.355,1780.557,"Excuse me, Mr. Foster."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1780.557,1781.238,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1781.238,1785.68,I gather the Appellate Division did not... There was no decision there.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1786.842,1787.212,Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1787.212,1788.081,--Court certified--
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,1788.081,1789.684,Certified directly.
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.881,2024.068,"--Of course, what you don't want to happen is to have people cross the Delaware River from Pennsylvania and come to work in Camden by day and go back to their Pennsylvania homes by night."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2026.281,2031.203,"Well, we... I can't say, Your Honor, that we don't want that."
1983.81-2110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2094.326,2100.1,What difference would it make whether the Union members are benefited or not to the issues in this case?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2100.1,2104.881,"Well, Your Honor, it does in terms, we feel, in position of standing."
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.801,2127.486,Last year we had a case where I think the League of Women Voters in Wyoming was challenging the apportionment of one particular county.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2133.871,2134.552,No.
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.895,2163.41,"May I ask, would your argument be different, instead of 40 percent it were 100 percent?"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2163.41,2164.842,"No, Your Honor, it would not be."
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.842,2170.506,"So, you would agree, of course, then that Philadelphia could have imposed the same kind of requirement on--"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2170.506,2172.335,We see no difficulty with that at all.
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.335,2177.04,--It would be better if each city preferred its own citizens rather than let anybody cross the river.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2177.04,2178.961,"Your Honor, I didn't--"
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.961,2184.753,I can see that this sort of ordinance cuts both ways for people in Camden it seems to me.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2184.753,2187.575,"--No, I would disagree with Your Honor."
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.845,2235.768,But here it is based on residency.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2235.768,2244.434,"--Well, no, it is not based on residency, Your Honor, because this is not an ordinance that simply says that out-of-state residents or--"
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.434,2246.104,Residency in the city.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2248.405,2251.427,"--Yes, but that is not, Your Honor, a privileges and immunities argument."
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.05,2264.776,"--Yes, but if you are... You say you have to be a Camden resident, but if you are a Camden resident, you are a resident of the state."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2264.776,2266.195,That is correct.
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.195,2275.642,"So, you are preferring certain state residents, certain residents of New Jersey to non-residents of the state."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2275.642,2279.416,"We are providing a preference for certain residents, those are residents of the City of Camden."
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.416,2291.634,"Mr. Foster, do you suggest this case would be some how different if the State of New Jersey had enacted a state-wide law saying that Camden shall grant 40 percent preference to its local residents?"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2291.634,2299.159,"Well, Your Honor, I think in fact this is our case in terms of the facts established because the State of New Jersey--"
1983.81-2110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.159,2300.791,It seems to me that way too.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2322.523,2326.387,"--Your Honor, I don't see that as being in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause."
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.64,2333.192,"But, you would say the case would be different."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2354.543,2361.098,"I would like to say this case is not here, but I am not clear, Your Honor, if the case would fail for that reason."
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.846,2599.495,--Mr. Foster?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2599.495,2600.206,--Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2600.206,2606.85,"Perhaps you have stated this, but I want to be sure."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2625.122,2626.822,"Yes, Your Honor, we do rely on that."
1983.81-2110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2626.822,2630.725,Because that is the first point in your corespondent's brief.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2630.725,2632.426,That is true.
1983.81-2110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2650.688,2656.041,But suppose every municipality in the State of New Jersey did the same thing?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2656.041,2659.125,"--Your Honor, we feel two ways about that."
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2668.7,2676.447,"No, but I gather you would say that situation would present a problem that the city ordinance does not under the--"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2676.447,2677.286,Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2687.874,2698.93,"--And, I gather you don't think the requirement of the state's approval of the ordinance makes this a state enactment rather than a municipal one?"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2698.93,2712.439,"--Well, Your Honor, that is the position the Appellants take, because the State of New Jersey has... this Department of Treasury has sanctioned or approved our ordinance, that it is state action."
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.926,2736.033,"I thought you earlier said, and I thought it made good sense, that even if the State of New Jersey had passed a statute saying that Camden, all Camden contracts--"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2736.033,2736.424,--Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.424,2742.187,"--should have 40 percent Camden residents employed, that it would be the same case."
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2742.187,2743.379,That is correct.
1983.81-2110,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.379,2748.732,Because it would be conditioned on municipal residency rather than state residency.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2748.732,2749.343,Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.644,2770.849,"Would it also be the same case if the New Jersey legislation said every city such as Camden and every other New Jersey city bordering on another state shall require local residency as a requirement, sort of applied to each of the cities if you can cross the river and commute to?"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2770.849,2772.549,Your Honor--
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.549,2773.75,One of the other rivers.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2775.69,2780.723,--I don't see any difficulty with that under the Constitution.
1983.81-2110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.345,2785.478,As long as some part of New Jersey is not covered by the statute.
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2785.478,2789.038,"--Well, I would assume that could be true, Your Honor."
1983.81-2110,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2866.259,2867.701,"Counsel, just as a matter of interest--"
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2867.701,2868.132,--Yes.
1983.81-2110,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.132,2872.025,--has the population of Camden declined in the decade of the 70s?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2872.025,2874.277,"Yes, Your Honor, tremendously."
1983.81-2110,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2885.994,2891.189,Does the record show what percentage of the present population is on relief?
1983.81-2110,1,37099,n_thomas_foster,,2891.189,2900.813,"Your Honor, approximately 34 percent of the population of the City of Camden is receiving some type of social relief, welfare assistance."
1983.81-2110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.349,2924.432,Thank you.
1983.81-2110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.432,2926.763,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kudatzky?"
1983.81-2110,2,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,2926.763,2928.372,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.81-2110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.372,2929.895,You have ten minutes remaining.
1983.81-2110,2,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,2929.895,2938.862,"Justice Powell, with respect to that very point, the City of Philadelphia has suffered many of those same problems over the last decade."
1983.81-2110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.622,2973.035,Do you agree with the city attorney that there is nothing in this record to show that anyone has been injured?
1983.81-2110,2,41572,steven_k_kudatzky,,2973.035,2975.026,"No, Justice, I do not."
