1973.73-767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.056,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-767, United States against the Connecticut National Bank."
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,37.019,40.684,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,257.676,270.509,"Mr. Shapiro, are there any standards used by the government or otherwise in determining when there is a concentration, an undue concentration of banks in a particular area?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,270.509,271.057,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,271.057,272.316,What is the test?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,272.316,276.704,We have used the test of the Philadelphia Bank case.
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,298.541,300.818,You apply that only to the state?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,301.53,303.315,"No, we would use it in a local market also."
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,320.107,323.75,Are there any communities in Connecticut with only one bank?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,323.75,325.998,"There are smaller communities with one bank, yes Your Honor."
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,325.998,328.603,What do you do about those?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,328.603,332.058,We recognize it in the local community.
1973.73-767,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,365.228,372.545,Do you consider a ratio of banking offices to population in this equation?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,372.545,379.59,"No, Your Honor, we do not because the test of competition is always a test of independent decision making entities."
1973.73-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.742,896.716,"Well, if you are right as to the standard, Mr. Shapiro, why is the Government had such a miserable record in the District Courts with these challenges to bank mergers?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,896.716,906.459,Because potential competition is a doctrine I think that lawyers instinctively react hostilely to.
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.701,1010.351,What was the genesis of potential competition?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1012.313,1014.716,The first statement of it was in the Pen-Olin case.
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.716,1023.748,"And that was not a -- it is not a genesis in economic fraternity, it was in this Court, it was a judicial genesis?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1023.748,1027.078,"I think the Court has been ahead of the economist, Your Honor."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.078,1028.031,Maybe.
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1028.031,1030.194,In this respect and although there was in the Pen-Olin --
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1030.194,1033.925,Only ahead is not quite the right word.[Laughter]
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1033.925,1049.018,"Well, in the in the Pen-Olin decision, there actually is a reference to one of the T&AC report which initially summarized the doctrine and there are traces of it in earlier cases, although it really received its first general recognition."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1049.018,1051.622,"And we just first really articulate it in the Pen-Olin case, is it not?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1051.622,1052.756,In the Pen-Olin case.
1973.73-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.373,1054.718,That was just one part of it?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1054.718,1056.957,"That was one side of it, the wings aspect."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.957,1063.79,"That was the potential competition and then the genesis of the perceived potential competition, was in Falstaff?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1063.79,1064.645,"No, no, wings --"
1973.73-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.645,1066.322,(Inaudible)
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1066.322,1069.179,"Wings, that’s right."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1069.179,1070.545,Both the actual and the perceived?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1070.545,1071.631,Yes sir.
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.713,1098.425,"And then the third, which was in the previous case, I am not sure if it is here, the possibility of the acquiree itself expanding into the other market that was in the Washington case."
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1101.315,1103.526,No that’s a --
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.526,1107.045,"It's a brand new doctrine, it’s genesis in the Justice Department, right?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1107.045,1110.674,We think it is genesis in the general policy of competition.
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.491,1144.53,There is a shadow of New York City in this case?
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1144.53,1147.098,"And there is a shadow of New York City, they contend."
1973.73-767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.763,1261.102,I think we will resume there right after lunch.
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1272.182,1274.661,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.73-767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.292,1855.546,"You think there would be a difference Mr. Shapiro in that approach if you are in a state like Connecticut, on the one hand or state like Alaska on the other?"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1855.546,1856.515,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1916.077,1931.618,"Well, I suppose there might be states where, as we don’t know because we don’t have a case and we don’t have any record proof, but a state like Rhode Island might just be pretty much providence and that’s it or a state like Delaware might be --"
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1931.618,1932.469,Certainly Rhode Island (Voice Overlap).
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1932.469,1934.049,But Rhode Island (Voice Overlap)
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1934.049,1953.244,"Rhode Island would come close although even there in the southern part of the state or out on the island that is off the coast that might be possible to say that is distinct but well, Hartford is 42 miles away or 50 miles away by car I think from New Haven and that’s a littler far to go banking."
1973.73-767,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.244,1955.578,(Voice Overlap) Western Connecticut too.
1973.73-767,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1955.578,1962.944,"And it sprawls, there are 11 metropolitan areas in the state and they are fairly distinctive, we contend."
1973.73-767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.113,2438.974,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2440.257,2443.623,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.586,2976.926,"Mr. Reycraft, if there is a difference between actual potential entry and perceived potential entry, to which of these concepts is your present argument more relevant to?"
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2978.863,2983.343,"Mr. Justice White, the Government offered no evidence on perceived potential entry."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.343,2987.642,"Well, that may be evident but that isn’t -- I am asking what about what you’re talking about?"
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2996.869,3004.008,"I understand Mr. Justice White that in analyzing either of these concepts, the Government does look at who is the most likely and then --"
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.008,3008.107,Why is that significant when you are talking about an actual potential entrant?
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3008.107,3011.798,I deny that Connecticut National is national potential entrant into New Haven.
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.519,3027.924,"Well, let’s assume though that you have four actual potential entrants if you could -- I know you say that it still here, assume that they were."
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3044.628,3054.738,"I think the most important thing that the Government is to show Mr. Justice White is that the potential entrant, the claimed potential entrant would have entered the town, but for the acquisition."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.285,3063.77,What if -- but the Government could show and did show it.
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3069.445,3071.157,"Well, I would think so Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.157,3071.67,Why?
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3073.121,3092.596,"I would think so because if the most likely entrant is the one who is most likely -- I do not know what’s to add to that, and the question is, what is the importance of eliminating a less likely entrant if the fourth most likely entrant is being eliminated theoretically then there are three left who are more likely."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.596,3111.275,That’s what we perceived (inaudible) but if someone actually would have been (inaudible) even the third most likely.
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3116.903,3128.45,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, I think that if the Government had proved that Connecticut National would have entered the city of New Haven by other means then they would have advanced their cause."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.394,3139.721,That the Hartford Bank would not be so -- would be a substantial if the Government loses something.
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3139.721,3155.688,"Well, I think that it is a question of fact as to whether they would have entered and in my conception of the evidence in this case, the Government didn’t make a serious attempt even to prove that they would have entered."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.688,3161.387,Other than just the so called argument and objective facts of the bank has a capability?
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3161.387,3173.198,"Well, on objective facts Mr. Justice White, I would say that the objective facts as to likelihood of entry would be based upon the size of the potential entrant and that the larger the entry the more likely --"
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.198,3185.352,"That’s a fact, we believe that but it still would mean that the bank (Inaudible)"
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3185.352,3211.28,"If the Government is correct that New Haven banks can enter the City of Bridgeport and if First New Haven was eliminated as one of the less firms which would have, but did not then the reserve question, Mr. Justice White, I would say that would -- the Government would argue so that was a loss of competitor in that area."
1973.73-767,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.28,3213.714,I would have said you wouldn’t agree with it.
1973.73-767,1,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3213.714,3222.574,[Laughter Attempt] I would agree that six competitors generally mean more competition than five.
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3812.398,3816.425,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4365.019,4372.443,"Well, are you suggesting -- I guess you won’t find that implications with respect to couple of reflective perceived entries?"
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4375.068,4379.371,"Well, it is -- the cases referred to the most likely entrant Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4379.371,4384.02,(Inaudible)
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4384.02,4386.094,This may be the discussion in those cases.
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4440.709,4443.849,But they are well perceived?
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4443.849,4457.692,"They were perceived indeed, yes, and as I say I think the distinction between the actual and the perceived entrant was not drawn until we came to Falstaff."
1973.73-767,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4710.646,4721.584,"Now Mr. Loevinger, the statute talks about lessening of -- on the effect maybe to lessen competition in any section of the country?"
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4721.584,4722.547,"Country, yes sir."
1973.73-767,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4722.547,4731.878,And I would agree with your understanding that the section of the country is the equivalent of what the geographic market phrase you find in Court opinion and so on.
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4748.734,4758.818,"That is correct sir and in fact -- but has been admitted by the Department, what Court found here is that there is no actual competition at all between the geographic, between the merging banks."
1973.73-767,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4775.753,4776.764,And he found the whole state?
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4776.764,4778.141,"And he found the whole state, that is correct."
1973.73-767,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4778.141,4785.721,"And yet he certainly didn’t find that there was face-to-face competition in all the state, not just the opposite."
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4785.721,4787.358,He found that he is not.
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4788.751,4793.952,"Well, they found that there was some face-to-face competition which he probably got rid off?"
1973.73-767,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4793.952,4794.669,"Well, yes."
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4794.669,4798.598,Now there is non-involved in the cases that come to this Court (Voice Overlap)
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4798.598,4801.21,"When he looked around, he did find face-to-face competition."
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4801.21,4804.171,"No, as a matter of fact the Comptroller found out and eliminated it sir."
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4804.171,4806.117,"Alright, but it was there?"
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4806.117,4807.369,There was some that was eliminated.
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4807.52,4808.945,It was there.
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4808.945,4809.94,It’s not here now.
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4809.94,4818.334,"And it might have been argued that if the merger hadn't been proposed, maybe in 10 years there would have been more face-to-face competition in some other sections of the state?"
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4818.334,4825.027,"Indeed, the Department of Justice tried to argue that and that was disproved because of the Home Office Protection Law."
1973.73-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4825.889,4827.855,But there weren’t many open towns then?
1973.73-767,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4827.855,4830.019,There just weren’t any places left that they would have there.
1973.73-767,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4967.776,4969.149,Thank you Mr. Lee Loevinger.
1973.73-767,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,4972.469,4976.58,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.73-767,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5048.623,5049.597,The big Hartford banks?
1973.73-767,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,5049.597,5050.499,The big Hartford banks.
1973.73-767,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5310.834,5311.498,Thank you Gentleman.
