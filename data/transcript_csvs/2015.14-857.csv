2015.14-857,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.465,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-857, Campbell-Ewald Company v. Gomez. Mr. Garre."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,9.465,42.71,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two questions presented, this Court must accept the following two propositions: First, a plaintiff can force a court to adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete relief. And, second, that a plaintiff has what amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that entitles the case to proceed even if his individual claim drops out before --"
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,42.71,47.62,Is there any controversy over whether the -- the -- the offer is complete relief?
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,47.62,53.58,"I don't think so, Your Honor. The district court found that it was at page 40 of the Petition Appendix."
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,60.42,61.79,"Do we take it on that assumption, too?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,61.79,70.68,"I think you should, Your Honor. Now -- now, they have argued below that the only reason that it wasn't for complete relief was that -- because it didn't provide for attorneys' fees."
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,75.64,79.35,But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,87.34,89.9,"I don't think that's what ""complete relief"" means, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,96.24,102.61,"Well, he would -- he would receive a finding of liability, which you didn't admit in your offer."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,102.61,103.35,He -- I --
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.35,132.275,"He would -- he would be entitled to an injunction against that activity, the activity that caused this particular situation, and if others were shown, to an injunction in other ways. So I don't see how this could be -- putting aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys' fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability determinations that were not made by the court below."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,132.275,132.76,Okay.
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.62,161.26,It -- it seems that you want us to write an -- an opinion saying that a settlement offer is equivalent to a judgment.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,188.27,195.69,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the accepted principle is that a settlement moots the case and requires the court to dispose of the case."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.35,199.71,But you didn't pursue that.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,202.599,203.28,Well --
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.28,212.71,"And -- and -- and if you want us to write an opinion and say, oh, well, a settlement offer is the same as a judgment, that just doesn't equate with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or with our cases like the Kokkonen case."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,212.71,222.41,"Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think this case is consistent with the Kokkonen case. What the Kokkonen case recognized is that, once a case has come to an end, the Court has ancillary jurisdiction to dispose of it."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,226.34,240.57,"But the Federal rule in point, Mr. Garre -- and it says -- Rule 68 says an offer of judgment expires automatically after 14 days if it's not accepted."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,263.635,270.895,"Well, first, Your Honor, this case, there was not only the Rule 68 offer of judgment, but a freestanding settlement offer."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.02,277.435,"Well, isn't that rather an end run around the offer of judgment?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,277.435,279.09,"Well, I don't -- I don't think so."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.16,295.35,"The plaintiff -- the plaintiff asks for class action, didn't get that because they weren't far -- far along enough for the plaintiff even to move for certification."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,295.35,299.88,And the plaintiff in Genesis Healthcare asked for a collective action.
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.44,304.85,But the collective action is simply a device for permissive joinder.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,314.72,317.48,"Well, I mean, here's how I think it's different, Your Honor. You're right."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.25,335.68,All it -- all it is -- it's an invitation to people to join you.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,338.625,352.32,"Well, it was still pretty important to the plaintiff in that case, and it was a statutory right. And here the question is: When the individual claim drops out, is there any basis for the action to proceed simply so that, on the -- on the potential that a class could be certified?"
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,352.32,367.965,"One -- one is -- is that potential. The other is, it's not that I would be entitled to attorneys' fees from the loser, but if there's a class, then there are a lot of other people who will share in the attorneys' fees and I'll have to pay less."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,367.965,380.96,"And that -- that's the cost-sharing argument that was made in Roper. And if I could say a couple things about that. First, the plaintiff in this case, unlike the plaintiff in Roper, never made that argument below. He never argued in favor of cost sharing."
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.55,414.83,"But if I could go back a little bit, Mr. Garre."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,468.27,477.33,And a court can make that determination just like a court can determine whether or not a defendant who says he's going to stop his action has truly voluntarily ceased his action.
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,477.33,479.78,A court can absolutely make that determination.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,485.375,490.81,"Well, I think it absolutely does, just like it would in the voluntary cessation context. I -- I want to be clear because I think we have a little bit of a --"
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.81,509.845,"Why can't it -- why can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment motion? I mean, why does it have to moot the case? Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment motion in which you admit the facts that make you liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable? And then you fight about the legal questions?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,509.845,523.52,"The -- the reason is, when -- when one party throws in the towel, the match is over. Here the question is whether there's an Article III case or controversy when the defendant is no longer fighting over the result as to the thing at issue."
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,527.7,535.4,But I -- but what's an Article III determination is whether he or it or she is entitled to the relief that they asked for.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,536.92,537.31,And functionally --
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.31,540.135,"But they're entitled to have the Court say it, not you."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,540.135,544.69,A -- a court can certainly make the determination of whether or not they have provided complete relief.
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.805,561.79,"By the way, you called this a ""freestanding offer,"" but I have it right here, and it's the -- offer says, ""Offer of judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68."" This was your client's submission."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,561.79,563.4,"No -- well, you're right, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.38,642.37,Suppose one day after the offer the defendant defaulted.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,647.835,651.21,"Well, and that would be an unusual situation if it did, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.39,654.62,It happened in Kokkonen. We had a case on it here in the Court.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,654.62,662.39,"And -- and -- you know, Roper's another case where there was an offer that the Court never -- it didn't really question in that case whether the offer mooted the claim on the merits."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.21,684.165,A substantive -- how about a procedural right to litigate entitlement to class status?
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,684.165,686.93,I -- I don't think you can describe it as a procedural right.
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,697.06,701.12,So why is it that we permit relation back at all?
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,701.12,701.61,Well.
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,701.61,709.635,"If -- we have cases that say when a case has become moot in the middle of the litigation, it can relate back to the beginning."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,709.635,710.17,Okay.
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.84,713.865,"If mootness is mootness, mootness is mootness, right?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,713.865,715.27,Yes.
2015.14-857,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,769.43,772.665,What if the -- what if the defendant -- I -- did you finish your answer?
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,772.665,773.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,773.43,788.1,"What if the defendant has very shaky finances, maybe on the verge of bankruptcy, or has a history of reneging on promises, and -- but the -- the offer to provide full relief moots the case, even in that situation?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,788.1,790.175,"A -- a couple answers to that, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.52,853.04,"And the offer of complete relief from a solvent defendant where it looks like the relief will be forthcoming, if -- if you lose this case and so the case is not moot, could still be considered as a factor in the court's decision whether or not to certify the class?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,853.04,858.825,"I don't think -- it certainly wouldn't be a classic certification decision factor, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.4,873.575,"In other words, the class certification goes along without reference to whether the lead plaintiff has any injury any longer?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,873.575,879.09,"Well, it's -- it's certainly a very unusual situation where the personal representative has been made whole."
2015.14-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.65,885.91,"That's why I asked if the trial judge could, in his discretion, consider that as a factor in certifying or not certifying --"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,885.91,908.82,"Well, I suppose that he could in the terms of the person represented, but the real question is: Why would you want a court to expound on the law difficult questions about certification, as this Court knows as well as anyone, when there's no case or controversy to begin with, when the defendant has offered the plaintiff everything? And then the question is: If his individual claim drops out, what interests -- to put it in Judge Friendly's terms, what interest does a -- does a plaintiff --"
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.82,922.92,"You keep referring, multiple times in your brief and now twice -- but in the case that Judge Friendly dealt with, the class claims had already been done and dispensed with, distinguished, extinguished."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,934.305,958.14,"Well, you're right, Your Honor, about that distinction, but I think what Judge Friendly said applies equally here, which is that when a plaintiff loses his individual interests in the case, he has no -- no right to -- to litigate on a class action because it might benefit others. He also pointed out that the offer of complete relief in this case, in this kind of situation, puts the plaintiff in a better position than a default judgment."
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,970.06,975.54,"But that's for future conduct, not -- not directed to the conduct -- the direct conduct at issue here."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,975.66,977.32,"Well, you can't undo past conduct."
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.32,997.08,"I -- I -- you know, I looked at the three railroad cases that you cited as proof that this has always been the case, but do you have anything besides those things? In the common law, I can't find any situation in which a court accepted a offer that wasn't accepted by the party."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1005.15,1006.16,"No, but --"
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.16,1014.2,"Have you found any case in the common law that -- where there was an offer that was unaccepted, was entered by the Court?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1014.2,1025.105,"Well, three responses to that. First, in the San Pablo case, for example, the Court's decision specifically makes clear that the plaintiff refused that offer. Second of all --"
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1025.105,1032.145,But you've had to -- you had to deposit the money in an account in the name of the plaintiff.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1051.525,1074.73,"That's -- that's, of course, right, Your Honor, but of course, if acceptance was the rule, then it's a little bit odd that the Court didn't mention the fact that he didn't accept it at all. The other point I wanted to make in response to Justice Sotomayor's question is: We cited a long footnote in our opening brief that has many cases recognizing this principle, and in our reply brief, we cite the holding case out of the English courts."
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1095.42,1095.92,But Mr. Garre --
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1095.92,1096.55,-- plaintiff was seeking.
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1096.55,1101.91,"-- and this is very much along the same lines -- you know, you have an old English case."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1154.11,1171.485,"So I think first -- just a quibble -- I do think there's a long-standing practice of recognizing that when the defendant has been offered everything he could secure, the case goes away. Second of all, and I think maybe more important: I mean, I would say that your dissent in Genesis Healthcare itself recognizes that acceptance can't be the rule in all cases."
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1183.24,1214.65,"Well, but I -- I said that mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. The appropriate remedy in a case where it's absolutely clear that -- that the -- that the defendant has given -- has offered the plaintiff everything the plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, but where it's absolutely clear where the defendant has offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for mootness but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1214.65,1234.52,"And -- and I think here -- I mean once we're at the point where we realize this case can't -- can't go on any further because he's been offered everything as the case comes to this Court, then the -- then the question for the Court is, well, how do we dispose of it? Do we tell the lower Court to dismiss it as moot, or do we tell the lower Court to enter judgment for plaintiff based on the terms of the offer, at which point it clearly becomes moot. I mean this Court --"
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.52,1236.2,"Well, it doesn't become moot, it's just been decided."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1238.72,1239.55,"No, there hasn't been --"
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1239.55,1240.1,There's nothing to dismiss.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1240.1,1242.03,"There hasn't been an adjudication, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1254.79,1271.655,"Mr. Garre, the only way that I see a Court entering judgment in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a Rule 56 judgment. Someone moves and says, you got everything you're entitled to."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1295.525,1299.0,"Well, first of all, a judgment is just technically an order disposing of the case."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.99,1356.73,"What do you do with the pleading rules that say, payment and accord and satisfaction are affirmative defenses?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1356.73,1362.13,"Your Honor, those are -- those are accord and satisfaction, for example, is a contract-based doctrine."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.79,1403.56,What about the personal stake that a would-be class representative has in getting a bonus or an --
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1403.56,1413.105,"Just as was true in Genesis Healthcare, the would-be class representative is in the same exact position he was before this case goes away because he could still file his own claim."
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.5,1423.705,That's --
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1423.705,1425.7,That's not an appropriate determination of Article III.
2015.14-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1425.7,1427.945,He filed a class action on your theory.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1436.07,1452.23,"Well, this -- this gets to the concern of these sorts of class actions are going to go away. First of all, it's -- it's hard to feel too sorry about the plaintiffs who have everything that they could possibly ask for. What we're talking about asking people, as a practical matter in these sorts of class actions, what they get is pennies on the dollars of their claim."
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1459.7,1467.66,"Mr. Garre, both sides have these class action policy arguments, but it's important not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness question."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1497.77,1498.37,"Well, in the same --"
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1498.37,1513.955,There's a -- there's a contested question as to what one person owes another. The -- the defendant has said he doesn't want to accept this offer because he doesn't think it gives him everything that's entitled -- he's entitled to.
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1520.025,1523.44,"It's just like the voluntary cessation context, Your Honor. In that case --"
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.44,1526.45,"I suppose he could ask for the key to Fort Knox, right?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1526.45,1526.53,He --
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.53,1530.56,"And then -- and then no -- no settlement offer would -- would suffice, right?"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1530.56,1532.01,"He could ask for a unicorn, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.01,1533.48,He could ask for a unicorn.
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1533.48,1534.58,Then you submit the case --
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.58,1534.96,Don't you --
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1534.96,1535.54,-- on the merits.
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.54,1536.925,Don't you -- don't you think this Court --
2015.14-857,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1536.925,1544.81,"There's a very -- there's a very easy response to this, which is if it's frivolous, if it's trivial, you dismiss the case on the merits."
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1544.81,1546.37,The Court can make that determination.
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.47,1563.36,"If it's a frivolous claim, I don't see why the Court can't dispose of that initially --"
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1563.36,1563.86,He can dispose --
2015.14-857,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.86,1565.04,-- in connection with the mootness --
2015.14-857,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1565.04,1567.26,The Court can make that mootness determination.
2015.14-857,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.535,1588.535,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Mitchell."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1588.535,1598.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Campbell-Ewald's mootness argument fails because an offer of complete relief cannot render a case moot."
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.59,1616.88,"If there's no -- if you're getting everything you want, what is the case or controversy? What is the live dispute in which you have a personal stake to the terms we use under Article III?"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1616.88,1621.83,The live dispute is in obtaining a court judgment that incorporates that relief that's been offered.
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.83,1626.575,"So -- well, what is it you're worried about, that they won't make good on the offer, or --"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1626.575,1631.0,The mere offer of complete relief does not have anything to do with mootness.
2015.14-857,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.94,1651.605,"Suppose Mr. Garre right now were to take a big stash of cash out of his briefcase, or a certified check and present that to you."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1653.895,1658.885,There might be a defense on the merits if Mr. Garre's client can say we've paid the debt.
2015.14-857,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1660.46,1679.27,"That would be -- there would be a case or controversy? If this were an individual action and the plaintiff had received from, and -- and the damages are -- the -- the amount of potential damages are undisputed, and the plaintiff has received that amount from the defendant, no dispute about it, there wouldn't be a live case or controversy?"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1679.27,1681.49,The defendant would have a defense on the merits.
2015.14-857,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1685.56,1686.93,What is the controversy?
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1686.93,1696.075,"Because there's -- there's a past injury that's been alleged caused by the defendant that could be redressed, in theory, with judicial relief."
2015.14-857,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1696.56,1703.27,Which would give the -- the defendant -- which would give the plaintiff what in addition to the money under my hypothetical?
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1703.27,1711.71,"He shouldn't get anything in addition to what he's already received, but that goes to the merits not to whether an Article III case or controversy exists. When a Court --"
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.71,1719.255,You're saying the defendant has -- has an interest -- pardon me -- that the plaintiff has an interest in the judgment --
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1719.255,1720.26,Yes.
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.26,1724.74,-- quite separate from obtaining all the relief that he requests --
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1724.74,1725.74,"Well, he hasn't obtained --"
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1725.74,1734.67,"-- again -- again, why -- well, let's assume the case in which they asked for $10,000 and $10,000 is deposited in a bank with irrevocable instructions to pay it."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1734.67,1735.115,Right.
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.115,1741.16,"What -- what is -- is the concrete injury, as the Chief Justice said, that results in adversity?"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1741.16,1744.32,The concrete injury is the past injury that he's already suffered.
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.935,1750.67,I'm sorry.
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1751.8,1756.395,"Everyone agrees, Justice Kennedy, that under your hypothetical the case should be thrown out of court."
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.845,1769.75,"Voluntary cessation can moot a case whether the plaintiff likes it or not, right?"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1769.75,1772.67,If it's certain that the conduct won't reoccur.
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.67,1786.175,"Well, if it's certain that they're going to give you the money that you asked for, why isn't the same result applied? In other words, why is it not simply what the plaintiff wants? He doesn't want the money he's asking for, he wants a judgment that he will give him the money."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1788.255,1794.68,"When you're dealing with past injury, Mr. Chief Justice, there's always a past injury that remains."
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.05,1799.385,"But there has to be adversity, as the Chief Justice mentioned in his first question."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1806.59,1808.94,There is adversity if the plaintiff comes into court --
2015.14-857,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1808.94,1811.96,Other -- other than the -- the -- the stigma of a judgment.
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1811.96,1824.75,"If the plaintiff comes into court demanding more and the defendant says, no, you're not entitled to that, there is adversity, Justice Kennedy. Now, the plaintiff is not legally entitled to additional damages on the merits if he's already been paid."
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.71,1855.96,"You put a lot of weight on what the plaintiffs -- but there's another interest here, which is the -- the Court's interest. You're being given everything you want."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1873.515,1874.29,Just -- just to be clear --
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.29,1875.91,"You won't -- you won't take ""yes"" for an answer."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1875.91,1879.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, we have not been offered everything we've demanded."
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1880.14,1881.7,"Well, that's a -- that's a factual question."
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1881.7,1882.09,Right.
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.09,1883.76,The district court said you were --

2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.52,1902.58,No.
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1906.17,1906.29,Right.
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.29,1913.13,Say the parties do not dispute that defendant's Rule 68 offer would have fully satisfied the individual claims asserted --
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1913.13,1913.47,The end --
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1913.47,1915.8,-- or that could have asserted by plaintiff in this action.
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1915.8,1920.93,Only the individual claims. And the district court was wrong to say that we did not dispute that. If you look at docket entry --
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1920.93,1924.45,"Well, did the Ninth Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of that finding?"
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1924.45,1926.24,"No, it didn't. We disputed in the Ninth."
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1934.06,1940.15,Did the Ninth Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of the assumption that the district court factual determination was correct?
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1940.15,1940.445,No.
2015.14-857,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.86,1945.6,I think that is the same as proceed to decide for question --
2015.14-857,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1945.6,1945.69,No.
2015.14-857,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.47,1983.405,"Well, you're -- you're -- you're contrasting a forced entry of judgment on the one hand with mootness on the other."

2015.14-857,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.63,1994.71,No.
2015.14-857,2,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1994.71,2001.58,The only proper response in that situation is to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).
2015.14-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.58,2001.885,I don't --
2015.14-857,2,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2001.885,2003.24,There can never be a judgment.
2015.14-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.24,2010.8,"I think -- I think when there has been a settlement and the parties have agreed to a settlement, the court can enter a judgment."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2010.8,2011.13,It can.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.66,2013.53,Even though the case is moot --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2013.53,2014.41,"No, the case is not --"
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.41,2014.95,-- because of the settlement.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2014.95,2016.055,The case is not moot.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.36,2040.77,It is a judgment on the merits.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2046.85,2047.65,That's still a judgment.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.65,2049.21,It doesn't go to the merits of the claim.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2049.21,2052.98,"It -- oh, it may not -- it may not resolve the merits for purposes of issue preclusion."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.175,2073.55,"-- so just to be clear on the facts without getting into dispute, let's say that the offer is for the -- all relief that you have asked for."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2073.55,2073.72,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.72,2080.09,"Not a question of what you think you're entitled to or what they think. Everything you've asked for, including all attorneys' fees."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2090.68,2100.03,"There is a case or controversy that might lead to a forced entry of judgment if the plaintiff, for obstinacy or other types of reasons, wants to decline this offer. It's hard to imagine."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.03,2103.06,What's -- what is the controversy? In the case I've hypothesized --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2103.06,2103.58,The controversy is --
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.58,2104.66,-- what is the controversy?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2104.66,2113.99,The controversy is the plaintiff wants a judgment of the court that incorporates that relief. A mere offer from the defendant is a legal nullity.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2115.0,2121.89,"You said if the plaintiff is being obstreperous or whatever, you know, the -- just refusing to take it for spite or some reason."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2122.755,2125.22,"Enter a judgment, not -- not dismiss for mootness."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.22,2126.435,And what would the judgment say?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2126.435,2129.255,The judgment would say: You asked for X.
2015.14-857,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2135.2,2135.78,But I thought that's what --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2135.78,2136.37,-- and enter a judgment.
2015.14-857,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.37,2138.1,-- Mr. Garre was arguing. He said he'd need a judgment.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2138.1,2138.32,No.
2015.14-857,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2145.14,2150.36,And I take it that this judgment that you're talking about would be: He offered this.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2156.175,2156.45,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2156.45,2158.47,-- and -- and now the thing is dismissed.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2158.47,2158.6,Right.
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2167.86,2175.89,"If the case is dead when there's -- when the judgment is entered, it seems to me it's even more dead when you've actually got the case in hand."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2181.77,2185.96,"You still have -- you -- you may still have to enforce the judgment, but that's much easier than enforcing an -- an offer."
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2185.96,2195.31,"That's better - it's better to be -- if somebody gave you the choice between a judgment that says you're entitled to a certain amount of money and the money itself in your hand, you would rather have the judgment?"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2195.31,2196.77,We don't have the money in our hand.
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2197.66,2198.765,But if you did.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2204.1,2210.535,"If we actually had the money in hand, we're not entitled to an additional judgment because the defendant in that case would have a defense on the merits."
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.41,2213.54,Okay.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2214.12,2214.925,It's jurisdictional --
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.925,2215.23,Sorry.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2215.23,2215.64,I'm sorry.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.82,2219.03,My goodness. So every case has to be tried even when you've --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2219.03,2219.09,No.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.09,2219.68,-- been paid.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2219.68,2220.3,Not tried.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.3,2221.59,"He's, I want a judgment."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2221.59,2221.97,No.
2015.14-857,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.97,2223.16,And you say it's not moot.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2223.16,2235.84,"The court can say, we're terminating the litigation and entering judgment for you, Mr. Plaintiff, because you're not accepting an unconditional surrender from the defendant. You don't go go trial in that situation. You enter judgment for the plaintiff."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2248.1,2248.48,So if --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2248.48,2249.99,Not by contract; not by any remedy.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.99,2255.85,"If, Mr. Garre, as you're leaving the court -- courtroom today says, here, we will accept an entry of judgment."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2263.08,2264.8,"Well, it certainly would not be moot."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2264.8,2265.605,Would it be over?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2265.605,2276.97,"If he wants to accept an entry of judgment on everything that we've asked for, which includes the attorneys' fees; a real injunction, not a vague, ""obey the law"" injunction that's in his offer; and class certification and class relief."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2276.97,2278.01,"Oh, well, that's the whole thing; right?"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2278.01,2278.2,Right.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.35,2280.08,This is all about class certification.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2280.08,2285.845,But we -- one does not get to class certification until the court first concludes that the individual claims have become moot.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2289.18,2300.33,"So the case comes down to once we put away -- hypothesize that you're getting everything you, as the plaintiff in this case has asked for, it comes down to whether or not you can get the class certified."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2300.33,2305.28,But it comes -- the question presented asked whether the offer of complete relief moots the case.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2305.28,2305.81,And you're saying --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2305.81,2306.35,And the answer to that --
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.35,2306.9,And you're saying --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2306.9,2307.2,-- question is no.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2307.2,2307.55,Excuse me.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2307.55,2308.015,I'm sorry.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2308.015,2313.315,And you're saying that it's not because of the possibility that you could get a class certified.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2313.315,2314.0,"Well, that's one --"
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.0,2316.81,My hypothesis is you get everything else.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2317.355,2317.7,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2317.7,2319.58,The only thing they don't say -- they enter a judgment.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2332.1,2333.92,That's -- that's one of the many reasons why it's not --
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.92,2334.7,I don't see why that one --
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2334.7,2335.03,Of course not.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.03,2341.555,"-- would be a good -- the thing I thought was interesting here, and I wanted to know your position, is the AFL-CIO brief."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2341.555,2341.99,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.99,2343.03,Which is on your side.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2343.03,2343.37,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.37,2344.959,Do you agree with it.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2344.959,2347.74,I wouldn't say that we agree with all --
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.74,2349.195,I want to know: Do you agree with it?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2349.195,2349.9,"No, we don't."
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.9,2350.305,Fine.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2390.73,2392.65,"It may be over, but it's not moot."
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.65,2398.725,"Why -- who -- what the judge does is say they want $10,000."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2406.245,2406.735,Right.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.735,2411.525,"The judge at that point should say, the defendant has all he wants."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2422.27,2424.775,He gets judgment on the merits in those situation.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.775,2425.29,Fine.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2427.04,2428.89,It's actually a very important distinction.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.89,2429.29,Why?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2429.29,2431.245,Because many reasons.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.245,2432.45,"Well, give me one."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2432.45,2433.51,All right.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.25,2440.98,I'm not interested at the moment in the question asked.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2443.195,2445.41,All right.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.66,2467.69,And that isn't what I said. You now sound as if you are agreeing with the AFL-CIO.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2467.69,2471.015,I don't agree with it because they are implying that that would moot the case.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.015,2474.9,"No, they don't say what the effect of it would be."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2474.9,2474.99,Fine.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2474.99,2477.12,What I want -- I'm being practical.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2477.12,2477.575,Okay.
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.575,2484.07,And the practical thing is that the defendant wants to pay off the plaintiff by giving him everything he wants.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2502.755,2504.69,"If he's gotten everything he's asked for, that goes --"
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2504.69,2506.295,Not the class certification.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2507.51,2510.075,"Yeah, apart from class action which is a more complicated question."
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.075,2512.13,"No, it's not a more complicated question."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2528.62,2537.23,"The case is not over if you're talking about class certification, because Roper holds specifically that the representative plaintiff can continue litigating the class certification if there's --"
2015.14-857,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.23,2545.73,Even though there's been a certified check tendered to the plaintiff and a judgment has been entered giving -- saying the case is over because he's got everything he wants.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2545.73,2547.24,That was the situation in Roper.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.72,2563.88,What is -- what is the financial stake here?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2563.88,2564.6,There's two of them.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2566.275,2566.53,Okay.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2570.56,2570.84,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.7,2571.89,Okay.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2572.43,2572.84,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.84,2573.055,Right.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2573.055,2573.4,Right.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2573.4,2574.13,What was the other one?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2574.13,2581.179,The other one would be the incentive award that he would recover if the class is certified and the case proceeds either to settlement or victory.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.3,2583.23,The incentive award?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2583.23,2588.305,"The incentive award. Normally, a representative plaintiff after a class gets certified and the settlement gets --"
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2588.305,2600.75,Is -- is there any concern that a plaintiff who has received or has been offered all relief that he could receive is an appropriate representative plaintiff of parties who have not gotten all the relief?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2600.75,2605.965,"That -- that might be something for a court to consider under Rule 23, whether this person is an adequate representative."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.95,2625.92,So the argument is that an individual plaintiff who has gotten everything that he has asked for -- and I realize you argue that isn't the case here.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2625.92,2626.64,"Yeah, not even close, yeah."
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2626.64,2634.895,-- is -- is entitled to proceed with the litigation because he might get a bonus from a class action that he would like to lead?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2634.895,2635.8,That's correct.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2635.8,2636.085,Okay.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2636.085,2648.755,"But, again, that's only one of many reasons why we win on the mootness question. And, you know, there's still the problem of the mutual exclusivity between a mootness finding and a forced entry of judgment."
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2648.755,2664.535,"Can I ask you just a practical question? Is Mr. Garre right that this is a case, if he were to proceed, if it were -- the class were certified and you get a judgment, this is a case where the class action attorneys are going to get a lot and the members of the class are going to get virtually nothing?"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2664.535,2664.81,No.
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2664.81,2677.41,"You would have to prove that at the -- to establish damages, would you not, that the members of the class did not consent to receive these messages, right?"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2677.41,2678.36,That's correct.
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2679.21,2696.875,"How would you do that? How would you be able to -- how can you prove that somebody -- some member of the class at some point when they were agreeing to something on the Internet didn't click a box that said I agree to receive messages from all of, you know, a big class of senders?"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2696.875,2704.405,"There are opt-in lists that are maintained by companies like MindMatics and Campbell-Ewald that can be discovered, and that's how we would go about proving it."
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2704.405,2708.15,What do you think the class members would get?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2708.15,2709.23,They're entitled to --
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2709.23,2712.33,"Individual class members, as a practical matter, what would they get at the end of --"
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2712.33,2714.84,What would they get in a settlement? I would imagine they would probably get --
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2714.84,2715.81,A settlement? You're --
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2715.81,2716.53,If it settles.
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2716.53,2717.87,What if it's not?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2717.87,2725.59,"They're entitled to $500 a piece in statutory damages that could be trebled to $1,500, if we can show there was a violation."
2015.14-857,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2725.59,2730.335,And you're going to be able to determine who did not -- prove that certain people did not consent?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2730.335,2735.68,"It would be based on whether they appeared on the opt-in list, whether they had appeared on some type of opt-in list from which --"
2015.14-857,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.68,2738.34,What do you -- do you get on that opt-in list?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2738.34,2746.52,You have to check a box or submit a form that says you're interested in receiving e-mails or text messages about certain topics.
2015.14-857,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2760.45,2777.795,"We haven't talked about the second issue that you raise, and one curiosity is the -- the actor that did something wrong was -- what is it? MindMatics."
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2777.795,2779.585,"Yes, MindMatics."
2015.14-857,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2779.585,2781.38,But you didn't sue.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2786.44,2790.755,"Campbell-Ewald is vicariously liable, and they were the ones that were sued."
2015.14-857,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2790.95,2793.51,So you're relying on vicarious liability?
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2793.51,2793.715,Yes.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2796.17,2796.39,Sure.
2015.14-857,3,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2796.39,2804.325,Thank you. The Ninth Circuit found that the TCPA incorporates vicarious liability and that Campbell-Ewald is vicariously liable for MindMatics' actions.
2015.14-857,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2806.315,2822.895,"Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Yang."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2822.895,2852.355,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to take the opportunity to clarify the Article III question by addressing the elements of an Article III case or controversy and established Federal practice that I believe shows that an offer -- an unaccepted offer, in particular, cannot moot a case. And if there's time, I'd like to address the derivative sovereign immunity argument. First, there is a distinction that this Court has established between prospective relief and retrospective relief."
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.83,2914.47,I'm sorry.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2929.295,2929.77,Well --
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.77,2932.05,And that's what's being challenged here.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2932.05,2932.9,I don't believe so.
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.03,2954.4,"There has to be injury, in fact, okay."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2970.014,2972.57,I believe it's embedded in --
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.57,2984.04,"If somebody comes in and says, yes, you've been injured, the Court could provide relief, but I agree with all of that, and here is the money."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2984.04,2987.74,"Well, then the case is not moot. The court can grant relief."
2015.14-857,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3031.465,3052.61,"Mr. Yang, I -- I -- I do understand what you and Petitioner -- Respondent's counsel are arguing, which is someone, a judge, has to say, at some point, this is in fact complete relief and enter a judgment for that complete relief. That's your argument."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3052.61,3054.125,"In part, I believe that's right."
2015.14-857,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3054.125,3056.26,All right. Parties could stipulate.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3065.71,3068.04,The -- and the parties when they agree.
2015.14-857,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.04,3068.29,Right.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3068.29,3088.09,"When they say, we've agreed and we -- we give up, the case will normally be thought of as moot. But there is -- there is several longstanding Federal practices, both in Federal courts, actually, as well as the State courts, that I think reflects this point. A party -- parties can agree to settle a case, but a court retains jurisdiction to enter a consent decree."
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.49,3107.98,Excuse me. It -- it has authority to enter that even though the case is moot; right?
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3107.98,3108.38,No.
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.45,3115.26,"But when there's a settlement offer which has been accepted, the court can nonetheless issue a judgment enforcing that settlement, no?"
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3115.26,3123.585,"The case is not moot because the parties are -- are saying, we are agreeing on the entry of a judgment, not we're agreeing in the abstract to just --"
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.585,3123.89,Oh --
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3123.89,3124.91,-- to settle the case.
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.91,3138.74,"So -- so even though the parties have no adverseness at all and they all agree on what the outcome should be, but we want a court to go into this matter which we've all agreed on because we want a judgment? Is -- is -- is that --"
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3138.74,3138.88,What --
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.88,3140.07,-- the Article III adverseness requirement?
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3140.07,3142.03,This is not a remarkable proposition.
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.02,3143.805,I think it's remarkable.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3143.805,3150.38,"-- all the time enter consent decrees. These are enforceable with the power of the court. Two, they also dismiss with prejudice."
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.62,3175.5,What happens on other grounds of lack of jurisdiction? What if the plaintiff has no injury? There is no injury.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3184.78,3190.805,"Right. The court would dismiss the case for one of jurisdiction, saying that there is no injury."
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3190.805,3199.42,"Well, what if the -- the plaintiff comes in and says, well, I want -- I want a judgment? Or because what other --"
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3199.42,3200.04,But --
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.04,3204.77,"-- bases, or I want -- I want -- whatever reason."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3211.1,3211.84,Our point is that --
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3211.84,3221.695,Other cases you say they dismiss it as -- why -- why doesn't that go to trial? Or -- or you get the benefit of the court determination?
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3221.695,3230.275,"The standing inquiry has to, of course, be addressed at the relevant stage of the case. So, for instance, at the pleading stage, if you failed to allege an injury sufficient --"
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.275,3231.34,I think you're wrong.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3240.81,3245.25,It's not a -- it's a judgment that there is lack of standing.
2015.14-857,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.675,3251.095,Indeed.
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3263.22,3281.24,"There is a -- there is a difference between a judgment for want of jurisdiction that the court is just, I don't have the power to address this. In a judgment where the court says, I have power to -- to enter relief that is enforceable through collateral proceedings through all the -- the -- the great power of a Federal court."
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3316.94,3326.87,"So even if a -- even if the plaintiff is given all the relief to which he is entitled, you say the plaintiff still has a right to involve the Federal court in that --"
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3326.87,3327.265,The --
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.265,3339.94,"And I was -- I -- I can't say that controversy because you still have to right to call -- go into Federal court and say, I know, Federal court, you're busy with a lot of things, but I still want you to hear my case even though I've gotten everything I could get."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3339.94,3349.41,And I don't want to mislead the Court into thinking that we're advocating protracted litigation on claims where there is a powerful defense like payment.
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.1,3386.38,Is a -- is a plaintiff who has been given all the relief that he's requested in the view of the United States an adequate class representative?
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3386.38,3395.17,"This is, again, not an Article III question but a Rule 23 question. I think that could be considered by the Court in exercising its discretion under Rule 23."
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3395.17,3396.01,"Well, of course it can."
2015.14-857,4,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3397.29,3402.155,"I think if the -- I -- I think that's hard, and let me tell you why."
2015.14-857,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.655,3431.795,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3431.795,3452.215,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, the Article III principle that should control the resolution of this case was stated in the San Pablo case on page 314. The Court said the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or declare rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. And that's exactly what's at issue before the case -- the Court today."
2015.14-857,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3452.215,3458.1,"Relying on the provision of the California Civil Code, which was quite different from Rule 68."
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3458.1,3460.83,I'm -- I'm not talking about the technical distinction of the cases.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3463.62,3467.76,"Mr. Garre, I am so confused by your argument."
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3494.11,3494.88,Your Honor --
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3494.88,3502.135,What happens if you hadn't done that? Let's assume that he was entitled to attorneys' fees.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3506.67,3507.25,"Your Honor, a court --"
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3507.25,3508.78,That a complete offer has been made?
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3508.78,3514.715,A court makes the determination that the offer is complete just as it would make a determination that the defendant had in fact voluntarily --
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3514.715,3516.85,That -- that is -- that's all I needed for you to say.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3516.85,3517.33,Okay.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3517.64,3519.03,Okay? Let's stop there.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3519.03,3520.595,And -- and the Court did it in this case.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3520.595,3524.19,So a court gets involved -- a court gets involved no matter what. Right?
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3524.19,3526.62,As it always would for a mootness determination.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3527.16,3527.665,All right.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3536.16,3536.57,Yes.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3536.57,3537.7,The Court can't -- all right.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3537.7,3538.99,"You could -- but it could, because the case is settled."
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3538.99,3543.145,But it can't just say that the case is moot and not enter the injunction.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3552.375,3564.205,"Your Honor, I think Justice Scalia had exactly the right answer on this, which is that there's -- there's decades if not centuries of practice dealing with this situation, and it's a settlement context. Everyone agrees this Court has repeatedly said that the settlement moots the case."
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3567.43,3567.87,That's just --
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3567.87,3568.51,-- to dispose of the case.
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3568.51,3570.195,"-- four distinctive words, counselor."
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3572.52,3573.43,"Well, I don't think --"
2015.14-857,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3573.43,3574.885,-- unless there is jurisdiction.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3574.885,3578.63,"I -- I think we're in a -- a little bit of a chicken and the egg situation, Your Honor."
2015.14-857,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3584.19,3584.66,Accepted.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3586.555,3591.43,"Well, We're back to whether or not the plaintiff can force the Court to proceed ahead and expound on the law."
2015.14-857,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3593.8,3595.66,Not settlement of the law.
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3596.005,3596.405,No.
2015.14-857,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3596.405,3601.8,"-- Sotomayor suggested, move this affirmative defense of payment to summary judgment."
2015.14-857,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3601.8,3605.04,"The case can go forward, in their view, and the courts will have to expound on the law."
2015.14-857,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.435,0.0,"Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted."
