1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.244,We will hear arguments first this morning in Fungaroli v. Fungaroli.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,19.753,23.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,42.765,77.071,"Mr. Morrow, may I ask you, your Opponents claim that you did not raise that as a Federal Constitutional Fourteenth Amendment claim in the North Carolina Courts and my own reading of the Opinion of the Court of Appeals for North Carolina indicates that they say you said it was invalid, as not giving notice of the hearing they don't mention any federal case or federal constitutional provisions."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,85.783,91.44,"Now of course, we were not before the Trial Court because there was no notice of the hearing."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,93.141,94.209,"OK, how about the --"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,94.209,102.955,"But yes, we did raise it on appeal, I think that our assignments of errors and our Brief before the North Carolina Court of Appeals will clearly show you that."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,120.509,128.937,"-- is a frivolous issue, or is it that the appeal raised no constitutional questions."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,129.729,133.395,The way I understand the ruling is that it was a frivolous issue.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,137.733,150.463,"Is there a time limit, either under the Rules of the Court or the Statute for the period in which that temporary order can be extant, without notice?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,150.463,152.247,For a period of -- I'm sorry.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.247,153.723,Is there a time limit?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,156.174,157.892,As to how long the order is good?
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,157.892,159.427,That's right.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,159.427,160.905,Absolutely not.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.411,169.802,"Many courts, for example on temporary restraining orders have a return day when it must be returned or the court imposes a return day."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,169.802,193.703,"We try to discuss that in some detail in our Brief to point out to you that the order is entered and then at that time, whenever the defendant is notified, it's up to him as to whether or not to go to court and with the burden of proof to try to set that order aside that is, the order issued under the Statute which we are attacking."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.703,202.553,"For our purpose, we really needed to know, I suppose, the contents of your Brief before the North Carolina Court of Appeals."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,204.753,208.501,"Yes, it would be in the jurisdictional statement."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.274,217.99,"Well, but that simply contains your naked assertion, your jurisdictional statement."
1979.79-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.494,237.833,"Normally in a record that's sent up here from the State Court, it might not even contain the briefs."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,237.833,251.925,"That isn't the question--wasn't the question in the Court of Appeals that you raised, ""Did the Court err in conducting an alimony pendente lite hearing as the Plaintiff Appellant did not have notice of said hearings?"""
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,251.925,255.733,That is the way the question was presented in the Brief.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,255.733,257.928,Was there anything else presented to the Court?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,257.928,261.283,"Well, the assignment, the specific assignment of error."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,261.283,265.11,"Well, where is that that says it is a federal question."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,265.11,267.394,It's in the specific assignment of error.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,267.394,270.227,"Well, I'm asking for it where?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,270.227,277.53,That would also be what would be in the Brief as well as in --
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,277.53,280.252,In the Brief to the North Carolina Court of Appeals?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,280.252,282.392,"Yes, and to the Supreme Court."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.392,285.461,And both of those are here in the record somewhere else.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,285.461,290.047,It is clearly my understanding that they were forwarded to the Court.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,292.307,294.423,Do you have it with you?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,294.423,296.078,"No sir, I don't."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,296.078,302.274,"Well, what do we know -- how can you tell me what you presented to the Court of Appeals?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,302.274,302.398,"Well, I --"
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.398,304.714,Do you want me to go and look for it?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,304.714,305.24,I --
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,305.24,305.697,It's OK.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,306.531,306.816,"No, sir."
1979.79-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.755,387.419,It is a jurisdictional question?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,387.419,389.474,"Yes, it would be a jurisdictional question."
1979.79-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,389.474,395.868,I have -- is the Plaintiff Appellant's Brief -- is that the Brief that was filed in North Carolina Court of Appeals.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,396.953,402.543,That is it right there.
1979.79-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,408.7,416.377,It's North Carolina Court of Appeals.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,417.642,429.039,"To specifically go into the Statute, I think that it is of course a short statute and one that I can read to you in a short amount of time."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,441.2,444.286,-- trials --
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,444.286,445.451,-- or hearings.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,445.451,449.313,"But, we often have hearings without any notice to anyone."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,460.689,462.773,Under very limited circumstances.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,466.718,468.241,It can in a divorce then?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,483.438,486.34,We cite to you in our Brief.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.854,494.283,"Well, now, just confine ourselves to that one question, if you will."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,494.283,497.705,"In North Carolina, the answer is clearly yes."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,499.167,503.464,"Yes, but is that the common practice?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,503.464,505.439,The common practice in North Carolina?
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.439,506.352,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,506.352,506.504,No.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,513.589,514.952,For temporary alimony?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,514.952,516.705,"Yes, for temporary alimony."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.682,527.345,"Well then, you're quite different from almost all the other states where that can be done routinely with a prompt return date."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,527.345,531.963,"I, of course, do not practice in the other states."
1979.79-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,666.403,673.677,"If you went into the Court and moved for hearing following the entry of the order, would the Court grant you a hearing?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,673.677,676.49,We try again to discuss that in our Brief.
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.032,874.86,I'm not sure I followed your response to Mr. Justice Powell.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,887.409,892.246,"Well, the only way I know he can do it would be under 50-16.9."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.246,899.343,"Well, can he move in the court to get a hearing on the issues?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,899.343,905.123,"Well, that is actually a move to modify based upon a substantial change in circumstances."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,905.123,909.38,"Whatever you call it, can he get into the court to have these issues examined?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,909.38,912.451,"He can get into the court, and he has the burden of proof."
1979.79-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,912.451,916.441,"And if he has the burden of showing that the circumstances have changed under the statutory language, doesn't he?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,916.441,918.48,And the circumstances have changed.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,918.48,924.697,"Now that I've interrupted you, your client initiated this litigation, didn't he?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,924.697,926.305,A suit for straight custody of the child.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.305,928.995,So he submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,928.995,930.296,That is correct.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.296,936.301,"So there is no constitutional question, at least with respect to the jurisdiction of the court over him?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,936.301,938.458,No body has ever questioned jurisdiction.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.458,948.758,"And therefore, we don't have the constitutional question that would be presented if a court purported to exercise personal jurisdiction over somebody outside the jurisdiction of the court?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,948.758,949.999,That is not the question at all.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.999,950.624,All right.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,955.684,958.777,"Well, burden of proof ancillary to the notice."
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,961.167,965.904,"Because, unlike Armstrong, he was not -- he didn't initiate any litigation."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,965.904,966.319,No.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.319,967.864,The husband and father in that case.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,983.804,986.096,"Well, I don't think it's different when you get --"
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,986.096,987.835,"In other words, he didn't initiate anything."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,989.986,990.606,That's correct.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.793,1003.572,To undo a fait accompli?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1003.572,1004.214,Right.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.214,1006.555,Although he was the father of the adopted child.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1006.555,1007.202,Right.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1007.202,1008.17,Right.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1008.17,1010.862,Now --
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.862,1012.698,"Mr. Morrow, could I ask you a question?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1033.507,1034.375,I certainly would.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.092,1040.578,Because of the fact he was represented by counsel.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1040.578,1040.876,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.896,1055.977,"But how would you deal with -- if you say the filing of a brand new law suit, and the husband is departed for parts unknown or is about to remove property, what would you say the statute should require to satisfy due process?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1055.977,1056.29,The statute --
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.29,1057.676,-- ample notice --
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1057.676,1063.477,I'm not saying that this type of statute could not be constitutional.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.899,1094.698,"Not if he's standing in the courthouse because if he shall have abandoned the dependent spouse and left the state by hypothesis, he's not standing in the courthouse."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1107.679,1113.035,You can give proper notice in that situation.
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.035,1116.941,Could it be accompanied by a restraining order forbidding --
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1116.941,1117.94,Restraining order --
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.94,1119.287,Ex parte.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1119.287,1119.541,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.828,1151.137,How does irreparable damage tie in with notice and hearing in the due process?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1173.276,1184.525,"Like I said, I don't concede that even if they allowed or alleged some type of irreparable damage if they could not get away with -- you know -- without giving notice."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.862,1249.198,"Well, isn't it part of the status quo the normal support which a husband is lawfully required to give to his wife?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1257.27,1263.784,"Well, then, if that were a proper hypothetical then every case, why give the man notice?"
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1268.334,1274.695,Tell me why it is not an analogous case.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1274.695,1286.93,"In the due process of all cases dealing with notice, the right to be heard, the right to know that the case is pending and go into court and defend yourself."
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.357,1323.454,"Typical service by mail statute or substitute service statute frequently requires 30 days return date, 20 days return date."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1359.253,1361.96,I certainly would.
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.96,1376.046,"So a man can simply move away 3,000 miles and until you can somehow get personal jurisdiction over him, he's home free so far as his duty to support is concerned."
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.046,1382.067,"Well, you have personal jurisdiction over him because he came in here as a plaintiff and submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1382.067,1385.237,"And the next thing you know, the court's entering orders, and he doesn't know a thing about it."
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.237,1394.756,"When you come in as a party to the court and submit yourself to its jurisdiction, then there's no question of the personal jurisdiction of the court over you."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1395.328,1397.258,Absolutely not.
1979.79-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1397.258,1408.261,That's constitutional power to issue orders that personally involve your liability.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1410.931,1413.012,No constitutional question.
1979.79-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.012,1424.538,Aren't you on notice in effect once you file a law suit of proceedings that take place in that court?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1424.538,1426.135,I contend that you certainly are not.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.145,1524.562,Is this alimony order still in existence.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1524.562,1524.785,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.785,1525.906,In force?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1527.591,1529.928,It's still a temporary order.
1979.79-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.928,1535.493,"Still a temporary order, but you say it lasts a long time in any event."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1535.493,1536.794,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.071,1542.272,"Could I ask you, while I've got you interrupted."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1546.754,1547.277,Ex parte.
1979.79-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.277,1555.729,"And you raised some objection about notice in connection with that, but I take it that that issue is not here before us."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1555.729,1556.765,That issue is not here.
1979.79-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.211,1557.596,OK.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1558.043,1558.73,It should have been.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1559.098,1568.46,"Mr. Morrow, I have in my hand a document, Plaintiff Appellant's Brief signed by John F. Morrow."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1569.75,1571.194,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.194,1574.878,And I read you the question presented.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1587.542,1587.882,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1587.882,1588.887,That's your brief?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1588.887,1589.929,"Yes, it is."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.929,1592.415,"So you didn't raise it, did you?"
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1592.415,1593.508,I'm sure that I did.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.718,1601.044,"I find two cases, federal cases."
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1638.757,1641.192,I'm sorry I don't have a copy of that brief with me.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.447,1657.854,When last did you see this brief?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1659.612,1660.431,"Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.431,1665.056,And didn't you know this point would come up?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1665.056,1672.515,I do not feel that it is properly raised under Rule 16 at this time.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.515,1673.806,Who raised it?
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1673.806,1675.181,It is raised in the brief.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1675.91,1679.514,-- and I didn't need any rule to raise it.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1679.514,1679.76,Yes.
1979.79-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1680.739,1683.025,I don't need any rule to raise a jurisdictional point.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1684.575,1691.188,"I concede that you don't, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.826,1703.46,We have only about three minutes left so you'd better bear that in mind.
1979.79-492,0,31662,john_f_morrow,,1703.46,1713.383,"I feel that it is very clear in the record and is actually found by the court order of the district court judge that number one, of course, they knew counsel of record."
1979.79-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.135,1765.844,Mr. Brown.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,1765.844,1769.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.623,1789.325,You may lodge them with the Clerk.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,1789.325,1816.219,"Several questions are presented here today, of course, for the Court's consideration and the primary one I am concerned with, of course, is the one that's already been raised and that's whether the appellant has met his burden under Street v New York and other established decisions of this Court to raise the issue timely and in a timely fashion, and a clear fashion in the courts below to give those courts, to give opposing counsel an opportunity to respond to those questions."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.491,1948.059,"Well, what if in the first paragraph after that assignment of error, the brief had argued and the reason this was our error was that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,1953.219,1957.886,"I think it would be gray and the reason I say that, this statute -- I think -- it would certainly be better."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.003,1980.612,"Later in the brief, the federal constitutional rulings by this Court were cited in support of the assignment of error."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,1980.612,1981.397,That's correct.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.397,1983.772,"It was just later, a few paragraphs down --"
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,1983.772,1984.588,-- in the brief.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.321,2020.386,"It may be that's a valid observation with respect to whether this is a proper appeal or not, but that would just mean it might be a certiorari question rather than an appeal question."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2020.386,2021.222,I agree with that.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.24,2042.378,"Well, that may be so, but how about a claim that he had been denied due process in these proceedings?"
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2042.378,2051.224,"I think that really goes -- that would be sort of an as-applied argument and because of the peculiar nature of this statute -- in other words, this statute mandates a certain procedure."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.731,2085.806,"Well, if that's true, Mr. Brown, one could construe the statute as only applying in cases where there's no counterclaim where the plaintiff goes in, and the defendant is not yet represented by counsel and that's quite a different problem."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2100.554,2110.52,"I can only make a heart-felt apology about that, and I have what I think is some justification and that is, it wasn't until the brief was filed that the statute was laid on the line."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.69,2128.406,"That may have been right that you could have moved to dismiss the appeal, but that wouldn't necessarily mean it was not a certiorari question."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2128.406,2130.355,"Well, I don't --"
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.355,2146.383,"If he had raised a federal constitutional question in the state courts properly and that in the course of these proceedings, had been denied federal due process because I wasn't given notice that I was entitled to."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2147.551,2148.17,I think --
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.17,2151.911,"That may or may not involve the statute, but it certainly is a federal question."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2151.911,2158.426,"Well, I know that in that whole line of cases there, I cite the Charleston Federal Savings and Loan case versus Alderson."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.928,2181.919,He really is complaining though that he was denied due process of law for failure to be given notice.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2182.818,2183.217,That's right.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.556,2207.433,"I find it somewhat ironic that you're claiming lack of notice of the issue in the case, and you fail to give counsel notice of a motion in a trial court and I don't understand why you wouldn't give notice regardless of what the statute says."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2211.756,2213.3,As to notice for temporary --
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.3,2213.84,For anything.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2220.746,2222.742,"Well, you're on your word, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.98,2226.932,Does the record here explain why it wasn't done here?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2226.932,2231.132,It explains it as best I think -- my brief explains it as best as it can be explained.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.004,2242.593,"Whether the statute's there or not, you did know your opponent was represented by counsel and didn't serve him."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2242.593,2246.32,"Well, what I also knew was --"
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.32,2252.31,That wouldn't happen very often in the places I used to practice.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2252.31,2257.317,"Mr. Justice, what I did know was this."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.904,2278.169,Is all this in the record?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2278.169,2278.499,"No, sir."
1979.79-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.232,2288.818,"You'd better confine yourself to what's in the record, Counsel, unless we specifically ask for you to go outside."
1979.79-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.818,2300.9,Why didn't you raise this question about his not raised this point in North Carolina in response to his jurisdictional statement?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2303.339,2304.172,I concede that.
1979.79-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.693,2310.363,Because it was important?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2310.363,2318.978,"If I -- Mr. Justice Marshall, I didn't know -- what I'm saying is -- the reason I didn't raise that response to his jurisdictional statement."
1979.79-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.928,2342.206,But he still said he'd been denied due process.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2342.206,2342.605,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.605,2344.291,And you knew that.
1979.79-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.79,2353.799,You argued in here that it was constitutional.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2355.098,2356.44,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.44,2358.652,You admit it on the merits.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2358.652,2359.309,I--
1979.79-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.309,2361.854,And now you say we shouldn't meet the merits.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2361.854,2363.044,"I don't think you should, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.146,2413.595,"If I understand the decision below correctly, is it -- was it held that as long as it's alleged in the alimony request that the person has abandoned and that he has left the state and the court finds that he has abandoned and left the state, that you never need to give him notice?"
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2413.595,2417.345,Did the court of appeals discuss that?
1979.79-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.58,2423.505,Why did it excuse notice in this case?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2423.505,2433.612,"Because it said in this case, the statute provides, what it provides and the facts in the record were sufficient for the trial judge to make a finding --"
1979.79-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.612,2435.285,To find that he had abandoned.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2435.285,2435.955,And had left the state.
1979.79-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.955,2436.858,And had left the state.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2442.951,2443.432,That's correct.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.917,2452.007,I asked you what the court held.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2458.404,2458.998,That's correct.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.998,2463.346,No matter whether they know where he is.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2468.296,2469.276,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.276,2471.204,Even though you know he's represented by counsel.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2471.204,2471.959,"Well, I knew that."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.582,2499.725,But you say he's not required to give notice.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2505.804,2512.231,You certainly couldn't under this statute because this statute's narrowly drawn and is just applied to temporary alimony situation.
1979.79-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2637.296,2643.197,"Mr. Brown, perhaps you've already answered this when Mr. Justice Stevens asked you the question."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2646.047,2646.563,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2646.563,2648.333,And you knew who the counsel was?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2648.333,2648.823,That's correct.
1979.79-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2648.823,2649.709,Personally?
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2649.709,2650.961,Yes sir.
1979.79-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2650.961,2652.646,"I'm puzzled, too."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2660.73,2665.084,"I've got an answer for that, but I'm told it's outside the record, and I can't tell you."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.87,2677.376,"I think you mentioned earlier, didn't you, that this particular statute was not in your mind at the time."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2677.376,2683.034,It was not in my mind until -- we had a series of events that sort of coalesced here at one time.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.046,2695.383,"You didn't file, as I understood you earlier, perhaps I'm wrong, your motion for temporary alimony thinking you were doing it pursuant to this statute."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2696.613,2697.221,No.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.706,2709.708,-- section (e) --
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2709.708,2712.423,And the documents we submitted along with the motion --
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.423,2715.943,And specifically this subparagraph (e) of the statute.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2715.943,2716.844,That's correct.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.439,2758.189,"Well, did the trial judge make an express finding of any kind that he was acting pursuant to subdivision (e) having found that he'd left the state?"
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2758.189,2772.417,"The trial judge, Mr. Justice, sir, went and made an express finding -- the only express finding if I understand your question as to the statute was because he left the state."
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.028,2833.377,"You really are arguing that as long as he's abandoned and has left the state, that that automatically terminates any obligation which respect to notice."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2833.377,2836.534,The very wording of the statute --
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.534,2840.683,"I don't care whether you rely on the statute or what you're relying on, but that's what you're arguing."
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2842.756,2846.28,I think -- I've got to make a distinction between as-applied and on its face.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.318,2851.591,That isn't what I'm asking you.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2864.433,2865.082,I think so.
1979.79-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.082,2865.753,You have to say that.
1979.79-492,1,17465,b_ervin_brown_ii,,2865.96,2866.955,I do have to say that.
