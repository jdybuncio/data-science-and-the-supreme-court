1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,15.251,16.833,"I am (Inaudible) moving party, Your Honors."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,16.833,18.342,"Yes, yes."
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,19.496,20.518,Thank you Your Honor.
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,21.627,23.5,-- talking about it.
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,24.554,36.066,This involves the claim by three former Korean prisoners of war for pay which they claim as owed to them under two express federal statutes.
1960.92,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.826,256.192,How did they -- did they commit treason in San Francisco?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,256.192,271.567,"My understanding of the law, Justice Stewart, is that a person guilty of treason or suspected of Treason can be tried in any Court wherever he's located, regardless of where the act was committed."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,329.022,332.822,Is that -- pardon -- is that fairly before us?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,332.822,341.065,"I believe it is Your Honor in the initial letter from Co-Counsel Harold Brown in this case, he demanded all of the back pay."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,386.063,390.826,Do you -- do you concede that this comes under the Missing Persons Statute?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,390.826,391.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,402.559,411.399,(Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,411.399,419.893,That's the debate -- the -- there is no specified date as to when repatriation was refused other than that it was after the August 8th in 1953.
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,447.184,452.495,Do you (Inaudible) prisoners of war (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,452.495,463.459,I believe the defendants had admitted elsewhere in their answers that they where prisoners of war until they were remit -- until they were dishonorably discharged.
1960.92,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.459,470.242,What if -- what if during this period they joined the foreign army?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,470.242,488.667,"Had they joined a foreign army, I don't feel that under this particular or either of these particular statutes, they would be excluded for this reason, if I might continue?"
1960.92,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,529.472,549.287,"Well, let's assume that facts are not too dissimilar perhaps for the facts that are actually here, that these men were missing and that they disappeared and presumed they were captured and were presumably, so far as our Army knew, were being held as prisoners of war."
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,578.553,586.163,Unless forfeited by some means known to law which would be either by Court-martial or trial in the Federal District Court.
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,615.781,619.576,But wouldn't be joining an enemy Army be a desertion?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,619.576,621.17,It could be if it was so charged.
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,621.461,629.283,"If it was -- if it was desertion, it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be under the -- they wouldn't be entitled to anything under the Missing Persons Act?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,629.283,639.162,"There's an exception in the Missing Persons Act providing that person is absent from post, which is one of the four types of unauthorized absence is not entitled under the Act."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,650.87,652.745,I didn't mean to apply it to your people.
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,653.966,659.975,"Well, throughout its brief, the Counsel for the Government raises this question of desertion and unauthorized absence."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,667.584,667.758,No.
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,668.594,682.202,"But in -- in that situation, if a person were guilty of absence, the prisoner of war were guilty of absence, then there's an express exclusion under the Act, under the Missing Persons Act, excluding them from entitlement."
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,682.202,715.221,Is it true that the (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,715.221,719.03,I believe that statute is precisely and directly in point with the --
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,719.03,721.823,But it's specifically (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,721.823,722.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,722.739,727.296,I really want the right (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,727.296,727.884,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,727.884,737.492,Because (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,737.492,739.254,"Yes, Your Honor, we would and if in --"
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,739.254,744.348,"So, if it happened with the (Inaudible) which involved?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,744.348,747.774,We defend them so that we admitted this fact by their pleadings Your Honor.
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,747.774,748.455,(Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,748.455,751.93,Defendants have admitted this fact by their pleadings.
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,751.93,759.84,"Right, so what is the whole -- I mean, what is the case pleading on the (Inaudible)"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,759.84,766.113,"I believe the August, if my recollection serves me correct Your Honor, the August repatriation dealt with sick and wounded."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,804.41,809.332,"There is a stipulation, is there not, as to the amount of money that's involved?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,809.332,809.809,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,824.562,830.487,(Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,830.487,831.21,"No, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,966.63,974.733,"If that is in this transcript, is that transcript attached to that finding? Is that finding in the transcript of records?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,974.733,975.06,Yes.
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1099.626,1101.367,"What does that mean, the essence of things?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1101.367,1112.914,"Well, that's the terminology that the Court used based upon these alleged acts of misconduct in the essence of things, they were not in the service of the United States."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1112.914,1115.116,How did -- what was their status?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1115.116,1117.906,Their status until January 24th --
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1117.906,1119.144,The period in question.
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1119.144,1126.702,The period of question was at members of the Regular Army of the United States confined as prisoners of war.
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1127.305,1135.483,Well -- but that is contradicted in the contemplation of those who use the phrase that you just used.
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1138.175,1143.321,"That is what the Court of Claims held Your Honor, in the essence of things; they were not in the service."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1172.208,1174.431,How - how is it terminated?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1175.159,1181.491,By the only way of status of the service -- of being in the service can be terminated is by a discharge.
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1181.491,1187.38,And -- on the basis of what can the discharge be --
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1187.38,1194.236,"Discharge can be based on -- you have three types of administrative discharges, two types of punitive discharges."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1199.52,1207.363,Do you -- do you assume that a man -- the status maybe terminated by the administrative discharge?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1207.363,1208.935,"It can, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1208.935,1210.975,What's the basis for saying that?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1210.975,1214.688,"Well, an honorable discharge is an administrative discharge."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1220.987,1222.838,But the dishonorable discharge is something else?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1222.838,1228.146,The dishonorable discharge is a punitive discharge and can only be given by a Court-martial.
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1228.146,1229.56,Was there (Inaudible)
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1229.56,1232.634,"No, there was no Court-martial here but there was a dishonorable discharge."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1233.592,1237.991,"And you agree, you admit that dishonorable discharge can be given administratively?"
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1237.991,1240.737,We -- we don't express opinion on it Your Honor.
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1240.737,1242.901,Well isn't that -- why don't you?
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1242.901,1244.236,"Well, I don't' feel it's relevant."
1960.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1244.597,1253.589,"And why isn't relevant because if it couldn't be administratively -- if he couldn't be administratively dishonorably discharged if he is still in the service, and then your case is clear."
1960.92,0,39464,robert_e_hannon,,1253.589,1257.758,"No, we're not -- we're not asking for any pay after the discharge, Your Honor."
1960.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1273.057,1274.873,Mr. Leonard.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1274.873,1288.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, it maybe of some assistance if I refer somewhat more definitely to the statutes which were involved here."
1960.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1364.814,1367.027,Is that in your brief?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1367.027,1368.992,37 The United States Code
1960.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1368.992,1370.429,Is that in your brief?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1370.429,1371.558,That is not in our brief
1960.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1371.558,1372.031,Not in it.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1372.031,1380.209,This is basically -- we have argued in the brief merely that there is no basic pay right shown by the petitioner.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1384.769,1385.688,What does it say?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1388.837,1424.667,"I quote from 232 which is now Subsection D and was at the time Subsection A, ""All members of the uniformed services, when on the active list, when on active duty or when participating in full time training, training duty with pay or other full time duty,"" and I skip, ""are entitled by law to receive from the Federal Government,"" now where am I, I'm sorry, get down to, ""shall be entitled to receive the basic pay of the pay grade to which assigned."""
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1442.719,1445.556,You say that is or is not applicable?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1445.556,1446.751,That is not applicable.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1464.162,1469.493,Well counsel argued here that they did come under it?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1469.493,1470.412,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1470.412,1470.598,Oh did he?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1470.598,1480.348,He is arguing that they have a basic right to pay and allowances which is continued as a prisoner of war.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1480.348,1487.17,"Well, I thought he was relying on 37 U.S.C. 242 --"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1487.17,1487.62,That is correct.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1487.62,1510.96,"-- which says, ""Every noncommissioned officer and private of the Regular Army in the service of the United States who was captured by the enemy shall be entitled to receive during his captivity, notwithstanding the expiration of his term of service the same pay, subsistence, and allowance to which he may be entitled while in the actual service of the United States."""
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1510.96,1513.229,"Well, in the actual service in the United States."
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1513.229,1514.328,The same as --
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1514.328,1515.118,Precisely.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1519.935,1523.009,"I just -- what I want to know, does this apply or not?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1523.009,1523.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1523.789,1525.339,"This one does, alright."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1525.339,1536.683,"In other words, he gets the same pay and allowances as if excluding the prisoner of war status, he has to do these things whatever conduct was taken care of in his normal status of an enlisted soldier."
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1810.993,1811.752,Where is that?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1811.752,1812.973,-- as a condition for pay.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1815.442,1817.889,Where is -- is it in your brief?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1817.889,1820.579,"No, it is not in the brief."
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2064.835,2075.212,Isn't that a two-edged argument if Congress had intended it under these other statutes wouldn't it had said so or couldn't it have said so?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2075.212,2076.966,It has -- it has in effect.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2076.966,2082.829,"If it did say so in those two statutes, but did it say so in the one that governs these people."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2082.829,2107.841,"Your Honor, it is not at all clear in the statutory history how these three particular parts which were not passed as part of the general chapter here came to be repeated after the Missing Persons Act had been passed which takes in all uniformed services and all prisoners of war and specifically as to prisoners of war since they was a question about that before."
1960.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2408.008,2415.004,"Mr. Leonard, on that approach, I gather that acceptance or refusal of repatriation is not really significant, is it?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2415.004,2415.657,"No, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2415.657,2422.292,"If they had accepted repatriation, I gather your argument would mean they still would not have been compensable for (Inaudible)"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2422.292,2428.931,"Had they accepted, repatriation pay would have picked out immediately at that point, they would have become subject to orders again immediately you see."
1960.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2428.931,2434.824,"But for the period before that, when did you say they were in fact workers for Chinese?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2434.824,2440.887,"Well, the period before, that could be divided into two parts - One, when they were not working for the Chinese, and two, when they were."
1960.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.116,2456.731,"Just as a matter of curiosity, is this kind of inquiry made on repatriation (Inaudible)?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2460.535,2461.661,But there were several others.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2482.62,2485.794,"Well, you think that's not a relevant question?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2485.794,2488.753,That was brought up in connection with the effort of the military.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2501.203,2513.773,"I know but -- but when you say United States wouldn't go behind it, that doesn't establish that he -- that he is -- that he has equal power to exercise (Inaudible)."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2513.773,2517.276,I'm -- I'm not clear on what the record was made in that particular case.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2523.845,2531.34,"Well, held where?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2531.34,2536.378,That was held by the District Court in Los Angeles I believe or on the west coast somewhere.
1960.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2546.765,2550.915,And the Government didn't seek to review that I gather.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2550.915,2552.928,The Government did not seek review.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2552.928,2558.67,Am I wrong in thinking that there was a ruling by the judge advocate general to the contrary?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2558.67,2560.66,I do not recall it sir.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2561.881,2566.525,"Well, is that a matter not relevant to this question?"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2569.281,2570.404,"Let me put it this way, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2582.819,2588.119,"That's interesting that it is subject of notion that although they're enlisted men, they're not in service."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2591.516,2596.284,Ordinarily this problem does not come up Your Honor for this reason.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2668.139,2669.421,Pardon.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2669.421,2670.277,On the contract --
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2670.277,2674.316,I don't think whether the parties himself or herself can determine whether --
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2674.316,2678.337,It can't change the relationship but they can lose the right to support.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2690.24,2693.12,If the statute says so perhaps.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2693.12,2693.403,No.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2701.444,2724.416,"Are you -- are you telling us that this Court has ruled that although a man is indisputably an enlisted man has a status of an enlisted man indeed (Inaudible), purportedly and dishonorably discharged -- dishonorably discharged beyond the power of discharging officer."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2740.929,2741.57,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2765.388,2774.594,I don't see any constitutional difficulty but as Chief Justice's question suggests it implied that all this within the control of the Pentagon?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2774.594,2775.455,"No, Your Honor."
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2775.455,2777.749,-- whether they should or should get paid?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2777.749,2784.746,"Not at all Your Honor, only these particular status elements which are found in the Missing Persons Act."
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2799.555,2807.039,"The starting point of our colloquy is that he -- he retains the status, we assume that he still has the status."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2820.431,2823.62,Only by special statutory authority.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2823.889,2829.52,Unless you have to go back -- but you have to go back in the line of the statute which allowed --
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2829.52,2830.204,Precisely.
1960.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2830.204,2831.086,-- the Department to do it.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2831.086,2834.462,It allows the Department to do it and that is in the Missing Persons Act.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2834.462,2835.196,Where is it?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2836.809,2870.993,"It says there shall be no entitlement to pay allowances for any period during which sets first, maybe officially determined, absent from his post of duty without authority, and it is provided that the Head of the Department concerned or such subordinate he may designate shall have authority to make all the determinations necessary of the administration of this Act -- I'm reading from Section 1009 and for the purposes of this Act, determination so made shall be conclusive as to death or finding of death and as to any other status dealt with by this Act."
1960.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2908.12,2942.054,"One question that bothers me, Section 10 U.S. Code 857, 10 U.S. Code Section 857, governing the penalties that maybe imposed by a court-martial, makes the deprivation of -- of the back pay effective only as I read it from that time on and not retroactively."
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2942.054,2947.194,My understanding is that the Uniform Code of Military Justice limits itself to a forfeiture of future pay.
1960.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2949.198,2953.562,How -- how do you reconcile your argument with that?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2953.562,2963.208,Back pay has all – back pay if any has been forfeited regularly as the administrative matter and by the courts.
1960.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2968.733,2977.169,"That was the provision I think that Judge Maddely relied on below, was it not, indicating congressional policy that –"
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2977.169,2977.84,That's right Your Honor.
1960.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2977.84,2982.789,-- back pay was not to be forfeited.
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2982.789,3009.801,"Well, he used the general statement that pay should not be forfeited without a court-martial which of course failed to distinguish between the punishment aspect of the forfeiture of future pay and the administrative forfeiture or judicial forfeiture of what amounts to an amount owing upon the ground that the service for which it was paid has not in fact then performed as (Inaudible) the Court and this Court in the Landers case specifically considered the difference between these two -- two matters."
1960.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3028.166,3030.058,That's Field's -- Field's opinion?
1960.92,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3030.058,3036.154,That's Judge Field's opinion.
1960.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3036.154,3038.638,Mr. Hannon.
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3038.638,3058.708,"If the Court please, first of all in regard to whether or not the plaintiffs have claimed or what statutes the plaintiffs -- plaintiffs have to claim under a cite the Court to page 3 of my petition that page point it says paragraph IX that these claims are made based upon Section 323 of Title 37."
1960.92,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3155.368,3161.756,"Or while that might help him, I don't see how a hearing help these people."
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3161.756,3162.345,Your Honor --
1960.92,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3162.345,3163.162,If that seem might be pretty well --
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3163.162,3164.275,I think -- I think --
1960.92,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3164.275,3172.942,Didn't we sustain a conviction for treason on -- on (Inaudible) the Japanese (Inaudible)
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3172.942,3174.228,Yes indeed.
1960.92,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3315.408,3332.534,Mr. Hannon do I understand that your permission basically is this that these men may not be deprive of this pay without a court-martial determination in connection with which there's an order of forfeiture of the pay
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3332.534,3337.492,"Or alternative (Inaudible), yes or alternatively, some other type of hearing."
1960.92,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.492,3339.042,Now what -- what some other type?
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3339.042,3346.716,"Well, it's not provided for in the statutes, Your Honor because I don't see how they could have another type of forfeiture under the court-martial."
1960.92,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3346.716,3349.112,Well then (Inaudible) what is your position in that?
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3349.112,3352.386,That should be -- it would have to be by court-martial if possible.
1960.92,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3362.95,3367.162,"That would be in connection with -- well that would just be a fine, would it not?"
1960.92,2,39464,robert_e_hannon,,3367.162,3368.859,It wouldn't be a forfeiture.
