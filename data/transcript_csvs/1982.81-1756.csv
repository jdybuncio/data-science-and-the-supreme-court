1982.81-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.072,We will hear arguments next in Lehr against Robertson.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,13.824,16.626,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,228.011,231.53,Was one of those categories those who register in that registry?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,231.53,237.601,One of the categories is a father who registers by filing a notice of intent to claim paternity.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,237.601,238.751,And he never did that?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,238.751,240.303,"No, Mr. Lehr never did."
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,240.303,240.769,He could have.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,240.769,244.804,"Mr. Lehr could have, theoretically, if he knew of the registry."
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.804,245.821,Why theoretically?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,245.821,249.773,"Theoretically because, number one, if he knew of the registry he could have registered in it."
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.408,253.525,Did he have counsel?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,253.525,254.791,He had counsel at the time.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.243,259.429,And counsel didn't advise him he might register?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,259.429,263.731,"No, counsel did not advise him to file in the putative father registry."
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.731,264.581,Does the record show why not?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,264.581,267.182,"No, the record does not show why not."
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.058,286.36,"Had he been registered, would he not have had notice of the adoption proceeding?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,286.36,289.795,"--Had he been registered, he would have been entitled to notice of the adoption proceedings."
1982.81-1756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.997,326.267,Do you suggest by that the state has no power to place some orderly procedures in the area?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,326.267,331.435,"--No, the creation of a liberty interest has two sources, the federal Constitution and the state."
1982.81-1756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.325,342.459,I'm speaking of the statutory process.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,355.584,364.642,"--The state can set up its own procedural requirements, as long as they meet the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, the due process safeguards that have been established by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1982.81-1756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.496,379.652,Are you suggesting that the registry requirement is in conflict with the constitutional right that you claim?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,379.652,384.554,I'm suggesting that the registry right is not necessary for us to have that constitutional right.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.857,394.025,"Yes, but one of... as I understand it, one of his grievances is that he never got notice."
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,394.025,394.827,That's correct.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.827,403.367,"And yet, apparently New York had a procedure by which, had he registered, he would have had notice of the adoption proceeding."
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,405.317,405.883,Pardon me?
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,405.883,412.123,He might have had notice of the adoption proceeding merely by registering in the putative father registry.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,412.823,413.256,Yes.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,414.389,415.925,"Well then, why... how is--"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,415.925,430.6,"Because what New York State has said is that before Mr. Lehr was entitled to due process safeguards that he had to file in the putative father registry or perform one of the other acts, and that he had to be a biological father."
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.72,479.381,"--Mr. Freeman, does that mean, if you rely on the biological relationship as a sufficient justification for the liberty interest... say there are no statutes at all... does that mean there could never be a valid adoption carried out where a mother places a child for adoption without giving notice to the parent, to the father?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,479.381,481.764,"It's our contention, although we don't fit within that category--"
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.764,482.416,I know you don't.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,482.416,487.251,--It's our contention that notice and the opportunity to be heard must be given.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.02,492.455,Is always entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,492.455,502.76,"--No, not necessarily entitled to... what I'm trying to indicate is that once a father is a biological father, he is entitled to the protection of the due process clause."
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.76,514.285,"Well, what does that mean with respect to a mother with a newborn infant who wishes to place the baby for adoption in the most expeditious manner possible?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,518.022,519.289,Absolutely.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.289,521.155,And the state must make sure that they--
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,521.155,526.193,The state must make reasonable efforts to notify the father in accordance with due process.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.053,549.908,"--All right, even if the girl doesn't identify who the father is and no one knows who the father is, what... it should be notice by publication?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,549.908,551.408,There should be notice by publication.
1982.81-1756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.408,555.31,To an unknown biological father?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,555.31,555.895,Pardon?
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.751,569.136,"And that would include identification of the mother, of course, and her predicament?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,569.136,571.172,--Not necessarily the identification of the mother.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.172,574.79,How would the notice... how would a publication be meaningful unless you knew who the person was?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,574.79,577.309,You could identify the child.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.428,581.811,"Well, give me an example of a sufficient notice by publication."
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,584.412,587.647,--We're not saying that notice by publication has to be sufficient.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,592.351,594.703,"Well, what does it require if you don't know the father?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,594.703,598.055,It requires notice by... some form of notice by publication.
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.055,599.539,And what would the publication say?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,602.774,606.409,"Yes, but nobody says that it has to have meaning."
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.63,613.767,You're saying a meaningless notice is sufficient?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,613.767,614.645,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.645,616.098,You're saying a meaningless notice is sufficient?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,616.098,620.316,"In some aspects, meaningless... no, we're giving him notice."
1982.81-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.643,637.661,"Well now, the state here--"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,637.661,639.111,But that's not--
1982.81-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.111,639.713,--Excuse me.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,669.566,676.737,"--Once again, it's our position that the state cannot do... we're not looking... the state has not met its due process requirements."
1982.81-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,678.671,685.342,"Well, has he met... has he met... has he given support to his claim by his failure to register?"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,685.342,688.21,--Mr. Lehr did much more than register.
1982.81-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,694.112,695.031,The state didn't know.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,702.618,705.47,For the purpose of readily identifiable fathers.
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.47,729.018,"Well, is there something about the registry that would foreclose an argument something like this: Well, the state has given the putative father a method of assuring that he's gotten... that he will get notice, but that doesn't mean the state shouldn't give notice if they know of the identity and location of the putative father by some other means."
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,732.02,733.406,"No, there's nothing about the registry."
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.806,740.476,Because here he certainly made his presence known.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,754.417,754.85,--No.
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.285,762.589,"Well, I know, but it wasn't... I know it wasn't meaningful notice about the adoption, but they knew who he was--"
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,762.589,763.189,"--Oh, definitely."
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.189,764.205,--and what his claims were.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,764.205,764.957,Absolutely.
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.993,775.213,Is there something about the registry that would say that the only way the state can be given notice is through the registry?
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,775.213,775.58,No.
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.717,783.702,"Well then, that's a much easier argument for you to make than the one you're trying to make."
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,798.929,800.546,--I indicated that that was not our case.
1982.81-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.65,808.934,You should just argue that case.
1982.81-1756,0,20862,david_freeman,,808.934,811.086,"Well, that's what I'm trying to argue--"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1565.341,1568.876,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.001,1635.037,"Well, what would happen if he had been on the register?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1635.037,1636.253,--He would have gotten notice.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.253,1638.055,What for?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1638.055,1642.441,To provide testimony regarding the child's best interests.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.441,1652.399,"Well, that's a... I thought you've been arguing that it wouldn't have made much difference, that the adoption would have had to go through anyway because it was a stepfather adoption."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1652.399,1655.183,I didn't say it had to go through anyway.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.9,1656.5,Well--
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1656.5,1659.902,"--No, I think the sequence of events is extremely important here."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.76,1702.331,"--Well, why did the judge issue an order to show cause?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1702.331,1703.581,--That happened in late February.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.581,1707.383,"Yes, after all... after the proceeding was all over, you say."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1707.383,1715.322,"That order to show cause was requested by myself, and it was strictly a motion to change the venue of the Westchester County proceeding to Ulster County."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.322,1716.139,Why did you want it over there--
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1716.139,1717.757,"I didn't want to play in his ballpark, Your Honor."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.757,1719.841,--if it was irrelevant?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1719.841,1722.459,I did not move to have the proceedings--
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.459,1723.661,"Well, what if it had been transferred?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1725.328,1729.196,--I would have moved... I would have done the same thing that I in fact did in Westchester.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.196,1730.83,"And what you're doing now, ignore him."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1730.83,1732.082,"I didn't ignore him, Your Honor."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.95,1737.136,"Well, what if it had been transferred?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1737.136,1739.519,--I would have done the same thing.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.954,1745.423,But would he have then had an opportunity to be heard?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1745.423,1746.241,No.
1982.81-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.707,1752.061,"Mr. Samoff, what's the distance between Kingston and White Plains?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1752.061,1756.097,"Hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.001,1767.071,Why didn't you give notice to the father?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1767.071,1769.155,The statute didn't provide for it.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.357,1771.557,That's the answer?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1771.557,1772.892,--We don't--
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1772.892,1774.425,Is that your only answer?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1774.425,1775.594,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1787.583,1790.634,He might sue you for libel.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1790.634,1794.27,We did not state one way or another whether he is the father.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.524,1804.126,Is it true that he lived with your client for two and a half years?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1804.126,1805.811,"--Intermittently, yes, that's true."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.811,1807.311,You knew that?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1807.311,1809.963,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1809.963,1811.632,And you knew the child was born--
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1811.632,1813.148,We certainly--
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.148,1816.766,--while they were living together?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1816.766,1824.12,--The child... they did not live together from the time she went to the hospital to have the child and thereafter.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1824.12,1825.789,"Well, I don't see how they could."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1828.324,1830.191,They did not resume living together thereafter.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.191,1838.311,"But they lived... they were living together when the child was conceived, and you knew it."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1838.311,1839.047,"I don't know it, and the reason, Your Honor, I don't know--"
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.047,1840.28,And you knew it.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1840.28,1848.836,"--The reason I don't know precisely, Your Honor, is it is true that they lived together over a two or two and a half year period prior to the birth of the child, but it was not continuous."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.634,1980.667,"It was all one sided, too, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1984.204,1985.704,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so, because--"
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.704,1987.006,"Well, that's what you just said."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,1987.006,1996.862,"--Well, I think that the judge... that there was at least a four or five day hiatus where action could have been taken, where a telephone call at that point might have been made."
1982.81-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.852,2169.804,"Well, could you summarize what his allegations were in the 114 proceeding?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2169.804,2170.204,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.451,2275.056,"Well, you can't avoid jurisdiction here just by saying, we don't want to deal with the constitutional claims, if they're properly presented."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2275.056,2286.045,"I think that under 1257, subdivision (2), there are a couple of elements: one, the highest court of the state... the constitutional argument must be raised in the first instance."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.264,2319.252,How could it avoid it if it's properly presented and might be determinative of the case?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2319.252,2321.235,--Because they found another means out.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.235,2325.156,"Well, so do you think it's an independent state ground, is that it?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2325.156,2326.989,There's an independent grounds.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.147,2343.968,"Well, I know, but if you reject the claim, if you reject the Caban claim, you have rejected the federal issue."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2349.036,2354.34,"--I picked up my cue, Your Honor, from the Court of Appeals."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.759,2363.861,"I was getting ready to say, you don't mind us arguing a little bit?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2363.861,2365.811,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.525,2395.414,"Could I ask you, is it, in New York is it inconsistent with the adoption to give visitation rights?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2395.414,2398.099,"--There is no law, there is no statute prohibiting it."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.884,2401.034,"It's never done, though, is it?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2401.034,2401.467,--No.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.861,2447.782,Does a mother always have the power to veto an adoption in New York?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2447.782,2448.765,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.384,2465.744,"So if the child is living with the father and always has, and the mother has departed and remarries, and the father remarries and the new mother wants to adopt the child, the mother can nevertheless veto it?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2465.744,2469.796,--That is an inequity that this Court I think cleared up in Caban.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.548,2476.035,"Well, if this were post Caban what would you say then?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2476.035,2484.538,"If this were post Caban, we'd have to assume for the sake of argument that he is the father."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.538,2486.24,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2486.24,2487.925,But that's strictly just for the sake of argument.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.733,2501.05,"You're getting there, you're getting there."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2501.05,2504.952,--then under those circumstances he now could also veto the adoption.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.302,2508.487,"After Caban, yes."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2508.487,2509.654,After Caban.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.654,2510.987,"Well, why shouldn't... this is a civil case."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2520.076,2527.782,"First of all, this is not a direct... this case was was not in the appellate process at the time Caban came down."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.782,2530.317,This is a motion to reconsider or a--
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2530.317,2532.517,This is a separate proceeding.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.517,2534.019,--To what?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2534.019,2536.637,To set aside the order of adoption.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.637,2539.673,"Well, has it got a different number?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2539.673,2542.125,I don't think there was a number.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.125,2546.26,"You made a... the motion is made in this case, the same case."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2550.129,2567.674,"The Court of Appeals ruled on this directly and determined that it is in fact a separate case, that the order... that the first case ended with the filing of the order of adoption, and that no appeal taken... actually, there was an appeal taken from it, which was dismissed by operation of law."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.346,2581.583,"Of course, he had no way of appealing the adoption."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2581.583,2582.85,"Yes, he did."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.122,2595.343,And that would have a different consequence than this procedure he did use?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2595.343,2601.33,"--Yes, because what would happen is, after Judge Elwyn signs the order he then could move to intervene."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.33,2604.616,"Well, it's sort of a way of avoiding intervention, having to intervene."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2616.423,2619.041,The right to appeal and the right to perpetuate--
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.041,2622.326,"What if the court had taken his Caban claim and said, yes, it's retroactive?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2632.198,2633.082,--I could have appealed.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.082,2645.942,"Well, let's assume the Court of Appeals of New York said Caban is retroactive and denying him the power to veto the adoption is unconstitutional."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2648.258,2654.797,"I'm not sure I completely understand the question, because if--"
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.797,2661.451,"Well, what if the Court of Appeals had ruled the other way on the Caban claim, namely that it is retroactive."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2667.371,2674.441,"--I think in order to come to that conclusion they have to come to a threshold conclusion, that this is in fact the same case."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.169,2748.089,Is this motion to intervene limited to people who didn't have notice?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2748.089,2751.625,I don't think it's... I don't think it's limited in any way.
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.179,2759.897,"Well, do you think somebody who was a party could, he couldn't intervene?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2759.897,2760.564,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.564,2762.916,A party couldn't intervene?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2762.916,2765.785,"If he's already a party he has no need to intervene, that's correct."
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.785,2766.251,That's right.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2770.453,2774.421,Either did not have notice or whose interest is--
1982.81-1756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.421,2775.19,You keep mentioning it.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2786.146,2786.613,--No.
1982.81-1756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.911,2810.78,May I ask this question.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2832.293,2840.632,"Given the assumptions that we gave before, that he is in fact the father, can establish it, and that he did not otherwise abandon the child--"
1982.81-1756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.632,2841.082,Right.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2841.082,2843.065,"--that's right, this adoption is dead, finished."
1982.81-1756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.065,2850.155,"So that actually, although we're addressing a procedural point, we may actually also decide the merits inevitably?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2850.155,2851.005,"Oh, yes."
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2885.828,2889.196,"Well, under your state law is that an absolute veto?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2889.196,2890.48,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.85,2895.85,Just like the mother's is?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2895.85,2898.136,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.988,2906.491,You have just said that he had never done anything for the child.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2913.995,2915.128,--That's a bit misleading.
1982.81-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.08,2919.88,"Not the mother of the child, but the mother of the--"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2919.88,2920.596,--Right.
1982.81-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.596,2921.365,--of--
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,2921.365,2923.098,"His mother, Appellant's mother."
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3000.664,3005.399,--I'm still bothered by your absolute veto provisions.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3010.12,3011.537,"Oh, yes, abandonment."
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3011.537,3014.172,"Well then, it isn't an absolute veto."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3014.172,3027.581,"What I was responding to, I believe, was Mr. Justice Stevens' question, that given the givens that we had before, that he is in fact the father and had not abandoned, then it is an absolute veto."
1982.81-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.116,3035.868,And it's only an absolute veto because the New York statute gives the mother an absolute veto right.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3035.868,3036.42,The statute--
1982.81-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.42,3038.303,Caban was an equal protection case.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3040.222,3040.822,--That's correct.
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3042.424,3044.876,"Yes, but a child can even be taken away from a mother."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3044.876,3045.459,"Oh, certainly."
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3045.459,3046.026,Lassiter.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3046.026,3046.726,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3046.726,3048.828,Some of the other things are examples of that.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3048.828,3049.578,Sure.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.396,3059.383,Vetoing the adoption or refusing to consent to the adoption doesn't have anything to do with custody.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3061.668,3063.42,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.395,3087.219,"If there wasn't an adoption, but just custody by the mother, unless the father was somehow disqualified he could have visitation rights and could maintain some kind of a relationship with his child."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3087.219,3090.071,--That's true in every adoption case there is.
1982.81-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3090.071,3094.889,"Well, in this case, as I understand it, all he wants is visitation, isn't that right?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3094.889,3095.774,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3095.774,3096.891,"Well, that is all--"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3109.482,3111.751,"If he is not otherwise disqualified, yes."
1982.81-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3115.203,3116.072,I appreciate that.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3123.859,3126.225,--That was the status at the time he filed his paternity petition.
1982.81-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3126.225,3126.692,"Well, what is it now?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3126.692,3127.644,He could change his tune now.
1982.81-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3129.929,3131.296,With a new petition?
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3131.296,3133.131,"Sure, with a new petition."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.447,3139.884,But he wouldn't win unless he shows the mother is unfit to have custody.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3139.884,3146.205,But we contend that that is precisely the kind of thing that he could have shown in his 114 petition and failed to do.
1982.81-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.205,3164.617,"Mr. Samoff, are you saying or conceding that as a matter of federal constitutional law that if the natural father does not abandon the child and doesn't consent to an adoption he can veto any adoption until the child reaches majority?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3169.204,3172.106,"No, I didn't contend that."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.743,3189.051,"Well, all you have to do is to change the law about the necessity for the mother's consent, put them on an equal basis, and Caban is out the window."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3189.051,3197.571,"Well, fortunately or unfortunately, New York has changed its law in response to Caban and has not dispensed with the consent."
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.609,3202.525,Which is the fathers.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3202.525,3203.811,Which is the father.
1982.81-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.946,3209.296,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3209.296,3210.981,--to establish that he is the father.
1982.81-1756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3248.637,3263.647,"Mr. Samoff, I thought under the amended New York law that the consent of the father would only be required if the father had maintained a substantial and continuous or repeated contact with the child."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3263.647,3264.382,Yes.
1982.81-1756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3268.567,3280.509,"Or the payment of support, or other things that I would think under the facts of this case would be very unlikely to be established."
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3280.509,3299.988,"If this Court is going to reverse and send it back, one, we hold this child in limbo through several more legal proceedings; and, based upon what Your Honor has just stated, upon the face of it he is disqualified, then what are we doing here?"
1982.81-1756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3299.988,3316.381,"On the face of it, would you not agree that under the amended statute even if it were to go back it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that the father would have a so called veto power or would have to consent to the adoption?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3316.381,3316.848,"Certainly, certainly."
1982.81-1756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3320.333,3326.236,"All right, but assuming he establishes that, it's not quite the picture you were painting, is it?"
1982.81-1756,1,33168,jay_l_samoff,,3326.236,3338.377,"--No, because I do believe that in any and all events he would not be entitled to notice... I mean, not be entitled to notice and withhold his consent, I should say, even under the new statute."
1982.81-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.477,3342.379,Do you have anything further?
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3342.379,3344.048,"Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.041,3420.812,Are you telling us there will not be a reopening of the adoption hearing?
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3420.812,3421.728,Pardon me?
1982.81-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.728,3426.716,Are you telling us that the adoption proceedings will not be reopened if we reverse here?
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3426.716,3429.032,"No, there will be a reopening of the adoption proceedings."
1982.81-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3429.032,3430.834,"Then they'll start de novo, won't they?"
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3430.834,3446.828,"There should be a starting of de novo, or possibly, there is the other possibility, where a hearing would be held as if the adoption had not taken place, giving the Appellant all the rights that he would have had had he been given notice originally."
1982.81-1756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.097,3477.065,Could I just ask one question.
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3479.349,3479.851,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.851,3480.584,Does your client--
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3480.584,3486.038,"Yes, we object to the adoption because it terminates our parental rights forever, and we cannot see Jessica any more unless--"
1982.81-1756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.038,3487.405,--You do object.
1982.81-1756,2,20862,david_freeman,,3488.305,3489.422,--Okay.
1982.81-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.199,3506.349,"Thank you, gentlemen."
