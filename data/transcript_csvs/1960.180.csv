1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,619.751,622.298,"Well, there were several sentences."

1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,694.616,714.917,"That, of course, Mr. Justice Harlan is a question which involves a basic distinction between the chief precedent relied on by the Department of Justice, the Doherty case, and the chief precedent relied on by ourselves, I may say without anticipating in my argument that I would be making the same argument of multiple counts which --"
1960.180,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,714.917,721.059,"The real involvement here is how much vitality, if any, Doherty left in Patterson."
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,722.82,739.287,"Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe that that comes close to focusing on the heart of the case, although we would take the position that regardless of the vitality of the Doherty case, we are entitled to prevail because we have multiple indictments here rather than multiple counts."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1183.995,1200.632,(Inaudible) is the sentence in oral of that commission or is the judgment to which the judge is the statute when he's given the (Inaudible) and requires the judge being consolidated.
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1200.632,1215.408,"Traditionally, Mr. Justice Whittaker, and I believe still today, the sole judicial force so far as a prisoner's rights are concerned and so far as his sentence is concerned is the judge -- judge's oral pronouncement from the bench."
1960.180,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1248.609,1251.748,You give a copy (Inaudible)
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1251.748,1256.84,"There is no requirement under the rules, Mr. Justice Clark, that the prisoner receive a copy of the commitment."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1292.71,1312.959,"(Inaudible) judgment of conviction shall cut forth plea, verdict to binding and the adjudication of such judgment should decide by a judge who has the filing clerk, does not contemplate a written judgment?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1312.959,1324.49,"There is no question, Mr. Justice Whittaker that the written judgment and commitment forms are authorized and are responsive to Rule 32."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1350.864,1358.815,"Well, I am wondering if this rule doesn't make the judgment, this written thing, that's defined in that rule?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1358.815,1381.221,"That interpretation of the rule, Mr. Justice Whittaker would in effect revolutionize the traditional function of the sentencing process in the courts because traditionally the sentence is the order pronounced by the judge in open court and is then recorded in various clerical forms."
1960.180,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1579.038,1580.65,What is the difference really?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1586.23,1596.006,"I would not rest my case, Mr. Justice Harlan on the profundity of the distinction drawn by Mr. Justice McReynolds opinion in the Doherty case."

1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1834.099,1835.348,No sir but they pronounced --

1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1856.278,1875.379,"That is correct sir but nevertheless at all time and I don't know how far I may go back in either my own recollection or on the basis of what the common law was with some feeling of accuracy, nevertheless, at all times, there was an oral pronouncement in open court by the judge which was recorded."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1939.2,1948.452,(Inaudible) the court could speak through its judgment and the question is which is its judgment since these rules?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,1959.653,1967.177,"My answer to your question, sir, would be that Rule 32 required there'd be a written judgment form."
1960.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2022.666,2033.308,Do you think the states would rather suggest that McReynolds should be construed merely a hope that judges would be particular said after all that they should.
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2033.308,2041.493,"I would construe it, Mr. Justice Black, as both a hope and an admonition but in either event, I don't believe it has achieved the result."
1960.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2041.493,2044.418,That there was an opinion came down this morning similar to this.
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2044.418,2046.351,"Yes sir, there was."
1960.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2046.351,2060.86,Would you judge that thereafter the Court could with impunity violate what the Court said must be put in the -- in the chance must be -- must be given to defendant when he is convicted?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2060.86,2068.706,Well without expressing myself with respect to either the majority pronouncement or the other pronouncement in the --
1960.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2068.706,2090.724,"Now, I was accepting if majority wholly and accepting the statement as they were saying theoretical, they can do it the other way, would you say that after that statement the courts to go ahead with impunity to refuse to allow to solicit personally the statement of the defendants?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2090.724,2120.561,"I would say a pronouncement by this Court prospective retrospective whether holding or dictum is a word to the wise and I doubt whether a District Judge, whether he concentrated on the words of the minority or on the majority opinion, in the Green opinion this morning, in the Green case this morning would feel as free as it did before the decision of the Court was rendered to disregard and ignore the rights of a prisoner so far as his rights to make a statement in open court is concerned."
1960.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.561,2137.464,"Well if that is to be accepted as a -- as a holding that theoretically that has to -- you have to give him that personal chance, would the same rule apply or should the same reasoning be given in connection with this holding of Justice McReynolds in the courts?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2137.464,2156.923,"No sir, because we maintain that it would -- that it would tend to a more dignified and a more effective administration of justice as well as to a greater protection of the rights of the defendant if Mr. Justice McReynolds opinion in 1926 were in effect confined to its own particular facts."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2396.11,2400.102,Isn't two or three word per word?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2400.102,2416.116,"Mr. Justice Whittaker, I realize that under the stress of a judicial proceeding, we cannot expect each judicial pronouncement from the bench in a criminal case to be a model of clarity and precision."
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2435.049,2461.093,"What -- what strength do you get out of (Inaudible) in this page 180 saying all the indifferent indictments will be consecutive, would have been (Inaudible) and all the different indictments would be consecutive, but what does that mean to you?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2461.093,2479.621,"It means to me only, sir, that they are to be consecutive that being the intention of the judge without however expressing any kind of direction which of these perhaps 10 or 12 separate pronouncements here has to come before and which is to come after any of the others."
1960.180,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2579.367,2584.384,What would you say you have to have concern to this?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2602.448,2629.576,"I think certainly one easy way the he could use to clarity what he wanted to say is to say the end of it that it is my further direction that each of these different sentences is going to begin running as soon as the sentence in the previous numbered indictments expires which is in effect what the written form of judgment and commitment said, and this is what his oral pronouncement omitted to state --"
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2629.576,2638.857,This is in fact to say about not quite those words well we did to say that all the different indictments will be consecutive.
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2638.857,2642.291,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Whittaker but it didn't say consecutive to what."
1960.180,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2661.824,2666.437,"Just that beginning with 10-676, is that right?"
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2666.437,2681.852,"He could have said beginning with 10, 7 -- 676, I would like you to or the sentence is to run in the numerical order just like the indictments are run numerically and that the next one as to begin when the last one leaves off."
1960.180,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2693.273,2696.691,You mean that you object to the word consecutive?
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2696.691,2703.039,No sir I believe the word consecutive conveys part of the meaning but certainly it's only part of it and not the whole.
1960.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.496,2737.856,"Mr. Rowe, under your theory in order to be entirely safe, a trial judge would probably, he will advise to write this out at the bench for mere reading."
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2737.856,2742.777,"I think, Mr. Justice Stewart that that would certainly be good and careful practice because --"
1960.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.777,2752.13,"Because if he did that, that would take any benefit away from the allocution which I mentioned in the -- this morning's Green case or in fact they're getting benefit away from anything happens to sentencing procedures."
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2753.591,2764.314,"Well he could prepare notes which he could follow and certainly give the defendant his right to speak up because the Green case, of course, concerned in not the judge's allocution but the defendant's allocution."
1960.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2782.599,2787.777,"Well he began revising it and he'd certainly be in danger of rambling on too, wouldn't he?"
1960.180,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2787.777,2808.436,"Isn't it also a proof that as in this very case, when this Judge got on the bench he never heard (Inaudible) this case has followed an indictment to this (Inaudible) some indictments and information, some most of which were involved multiple counts."
1960.180,0,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,2820.551,2827.63,Well I -- Mr. Justice Whittaker cannot tell from this record just what the claims the judge may have had with the case previously.
1960.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2884.688,2886.118,Mr. Greene.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,2886.118,2889.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3030.39,3041.289,What does the man know what -- what term he's serving if they are not specified by the order in which they are to be served?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3041.289,3043.884,Well he knows -- he certainly knows the total term.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3043.884,3044.654,He knows he's in jail.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3044.654,3045.651,Yes.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3046.746,3053.373,But does he know or does he know what he's in jail for at the particular moment.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3053.373,3081.453,"As I will try to show it, Mr. Chief Justice, I think in this case while the -- in these both of these cases, while the sequence was not expressly stated, the sequence of service was certainly -- it was implied to sufficient clarity to inform the prisoner and to satisfy the requirements of the -- suddenly of the Doherty case and any other cases in which -- which might have been dealing with the subject."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3081.453,3085.243,Well do you rest it on that grounds?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3085.243,3098.446,"No my -- my point is that the prisoner here did know from the way -- from the manner in which the sentences were imposed, from the way the Court imposed these sentences in numerical and chronological order."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3222.913,3232.992,"When we're dealing with the liberty of a man, is it too much to expect of the Court saying those things specifically?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3232.992,3264.061,"It certainly is -- is desirable to have as much specificity is as possible and -- and we certainly don't -- don't come here to argue that the most specificity that can be -- can be obtained is desirable, but these -- all we're arguing here that under the test which have been laid down by the Court thus far and the test of reasonableness, these sentences were amply sufficient to impose consecutive sentences."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3517.6,3536.114,"Well suppose -- suppose you have two accounts or two -- two indictments that he is sentenced on, and there is no certainty as to which one is serve first and he seeks a writ of habeas corpus and the Government served what have here isn't serving on this one."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3592.83,3610.377,"Well I would assume Mr. Chief Justice that if he came to the Court complaining about not knowing which sentence he is serving, the sentencing court would then as the sentencing court did in these cases specify if there is no insufficient specificity."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3682.879,3689.544,So you have -- you have to come all the way here to be sure of what his rights are?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3689.544,3689.845,Well I --
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3689.845,3691.893,In that regard?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3691.893,3699.437,"The sentencing court is certainly best qualified, and best equipped to determine what the sentence is."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3721.017,3736.569,Well then I understand you -- you seek to confirm the sentence by saying that the judge must be precise but he was precise here.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3736.569,3736.796,Yes.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3737.975,3739.384,That is your argument.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3739.384,3739.544,Yes.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3739.725,3750.69,"Well if that's it, alright, but you use the word imply -- it could be implied that this was true so that's a little different to me."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3761.221,3763.198,I don't want to -- I don't' want to mislead the Court.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3879.274,3892.622,"Is that the case where -- where once I've said -- Congress said it was 12, the other said it was 13, the judge said it was 14, and then it ended up in the written judgment as 12."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3894.648,3896.091,I'm talking about both cases.
1960.180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3951.388,3953.267,Why is that so?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3967.469,3970.008,He ultimately got 12 -- the -- the --
1960.180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3970.008,3979.444,"How was that done what you have is one plus two plus two plus two plus two plus two plus two, that's 13 if my arithmetic is any good?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,3979.444,3999.785,"Well, the Court of Appeals inquired of the Government in this case as to the total number of years that Mr. Payne wants to serve and the Court of Appeals was advised that as the Government construed the sentences, he was to serve 12 years."
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3999.785,4001.215,The government what?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4001.215,4002.967,12 years.
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4002.967,4007.635,You said they were -- the Court of Appeals was advised what?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4007.635,4016.323,"That as the Bureau of Prisons construed these sentences, as to Bureau of Persons understood these sentences they imposed no more than 12 years."
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4016.323,4017.247,Why?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4030.012,4035.564,"No, the judge I don't -- I believe the 14 years was simply someone stated 14 years but --"
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4035.564,4037.345,(Inaudible) you said the Court.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4039.292,4053.949,"That's what the Court said but as I indicated, the Court may have been a poor mathematician but he didn't -- he at no time imposed 14 years on the specific sentences that he -- that he imposed ov each specific counts."
1960.180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4053.949,4059.206,"(Inaudible) mathematician then because certainly that adds up to 13, isn't it?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4059.206,4059.973,No Your Honor.
1960.180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4060.556,4061.678,It doesn't.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4069.287,4077.394,Well the confusion that arose came in on -- on sentence on 10681 on the indictment on 10681.
1960.180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4102.493,4104.062,Well I know but he's repeated it.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4112.139,4124.261,"Well it was repeated at that time the original, the sentence that was originally imposed what we consider to be the proper sentence was 12 years."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4165.344,4173.174,"What is the sentence, the oral sentence he gave that day or the -- or the written judgment?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4173.174,4177.513,We would agree that the sentence of the Court is the oral sentence.
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4177.513,4185.827,And that the written judgment cannot alter or change that -- that oral statement.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4185.827,4197.723,"The written judgment, we believe, if it differs in a matter of substance from the oral sentence, it is void, it cannot -- it cannot change that."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4208.286,4216.218,And it can supply certainty that -- that it wasn't there when the defendant was sentenced.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4216.218,4243.042,"It can supply certainty where -- well, in these cases where the implication from the whole entry was that these sentences were to be consecutive in a certain order, then I think the written judgments can be use to confirm that that implication if further confirmation is necessary."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4270.46,4273.231,Does the record show this was signed the same day?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4273.231,4274.374,Yes.
1960.180,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4306.811,4308.263,May I ask you?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4324.393,4334.938,"Well, the oral sentence is certainly the sentence known to the law as the sentence of the courts."
1960.180,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4334.938,4341.829,It is your position that (Inaudible) the defendant wasn't present then the written sentence was witness was (Inaudible)
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4341.829,4356.208,"I think there would be great difficulty in maintaining the position that the written judgment was the judgment of the Court and which supersede the oral sentence because of the fact that the defendant is not present, yes Your Honor."
1960.180,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4356.208,4358.885,That I can understand.
1960.180,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4358.885,4363.271,Is the written commitment available?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4363.271,4364.052,Yes.
1960.180,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4365.121,4375.332,(Inaudible) can he write to clerk to get a copy of everything that transpired (Inaudible)
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4375.332,4391.06,"In the two cases of course in the -- in the Payne phase, the written judgments didn't get into the -- into the Court until the time that the Court of Appeals asked for them."
1960.180,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4410.69,4412.112,I'm not talking about the sentence.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4420.681,4427.078,I just don't know.
1960.180,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4843.179,4853.296,"Well that wouldn't raise Mr. Rowe's point however, would it, where he contends there's much more here than a mere clerical mistake, does he not?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4853.296,4863.973,"Well he would contend, I believe, that there is a clerical mistake in that the written judgment doesn't correctly reflect the true sentence of the court."
1960.180,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4881.185,4898.028,"So maybe I misunderstood -- I understand him to contend that these sentences, none of them being denominated to succeed other sentences all ran concurrently and then when he'd served the period of the longest when he's entitled to release."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,4899.432,4906.876,"That's right, but he is entitled to that release under the oral sentences, under the sentences that were imposed orally."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4953.402,4986.195,"Mr. Greene, what do you have to say to the argument of Mr. Rowe that in the case that you rely United States versus Doherty, 35 years ago, the Court although sustaining the judgment of the District Court said this and similar unfortunate causes should it manage the trial courts to require the use of meticulously precise language in all judgment entries."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,5009.064,5021.809,"Well, number one, I think as I've indicated, I believe these cases are much more precise than the judgment and the sentences that were imposed in the Doherty case."
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5087.661,5097.088,"I don't quite understand why it's clearer than the Doherty case, is that it?"
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,5122.639,5125.965,Well in this -- yes.
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5173.566,5180.277,And what do you say about the effect as Doherty case distinguished between the counts and the indictments?
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,5180.277,5194.096,"I believe that no tenable, no rational distinction can be drawn at least none has been suggested that would -- would make sense with -- for these purposes."
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5231.635,5237.311,"Is it pretty clear whether that's right or not, the Court in Doherty thought it made it."
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,5249.241,5249.644,Nealy case --
1960.180,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5249.644,5256.018,And that was based upon the fact that's otherwise different not different indictment.
1960.180,1,27130,harold_h_greene,,5256.018,5273.426,"There's no question, Mr. Justice Black, but that in the Doherty case, the Court said about the -- what the Court said about the Patterson case and Nealy case was that, it was not addressing itself to insofar as -- as its rule in this case was concerned."
1960.180,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5310.259,5315.045,Mr. Rowe.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5315.045,5317.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5363.238,5369.979,You should think perhaps the rule of -- growth of Doherty?
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5369.979,5388.074,I believe that Mr. Justice Clark that the Doherty opinion as shown by the developments of a 35 years has in effect given too much leeway to the trial judges which they have not employed in such a manner as to have required specificity in the sentences.
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5395.602,5398.298,And what about those in judgments?
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5402.382,5403.024,Well --
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5403.024,5404.974,That did on a form.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5404.974,5447.89,"I had thought, Mr. Justice Clark in the basis of the briefs, said that this point was opened but I believe that counsel for the Government has not taken the position which he might have taken that what we look to is the written judgment rather than the oral pronouncement with that kind of state his case has specifically for him did have the clear impression that what he was saying is -- and this agrees with our position that it is the judge's oral pronouncement in open court which controls and that any departures, any substantial departures in the written form from what the judge has pronounced an oral court is inconsequential and in effect null and void."
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5447.89,5460.221,This seems -- this seems to be (Inaudible)
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5460.221,5487.164,"Quite so and that was the reason why we urge that possession, Mr. Justice Whittaker that the rule must not be and cannot be lawfully that something is controlling on the sentence where the prisoner, where the defendant is not present because that is one of the most fundamental guarantees of our criminal procedure and that the defendant must be in Court, must be present when that happens which determines whether he must go to jail."
1960.180,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5494.852,5504.133,"And I think and also in effect, is it not that the time for appeal runs from the oral sentence?"
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5504.133,5510.236,"I, Mr. Chief Justice, I cannot give you a confident answer to your question."
1960.180,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5513.21,5524.811,"And then it did -- and if it did and the written judgment does not prepare for some days he wouldn't have any 10 days in which to appeal from the judgment, would he?"
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5524.811,5525.79,"That is correct, sir."
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5558.025,5562.4,"How did he get into penitentiary, this prisoner?"
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5562.4,5562.555,The --
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5562.555,5566.538,"He's in the jail when he's tried, let's say, and how did he get into penitentiary?"
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5566.538,5592.566,"There, the written judgment and commitment form, as we understand the practice is executed in triplicate or quadruplicate and one copy is given to the martial or to the other official corresponding to a martial in the sentencing court, and this form then, this copy which the martial has is the authority by which the body of the prisoner is delivered to prison."
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5592.566,5594.494,And the prison has a copy?
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5594.494,5596.622,The prisoner himself has not furnished a copy.
1960.180,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5596.622,5598.145,I mean prison authority?
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5598.145,5599.584,The prison authority has a copy.
1960.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5602.225,5604.683,"This was signed not by the clerk, it's signed by the judge."
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5604.683,5605.726,It is signed by the judge.
1960.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5617.646,5619.125,Entered on the same day.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5619.125,5639.892,"In this case it was on the same day but there's certainly no requirement that as the judge signed it on the same day and then inquiring of the local district court as to their procedure that we were told that it's signed by the judge either on the same day or on the next business day which frequently has became Friday and Monday, yes."
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5748.612,5767.285,"What have you to say, sir, in respect to argue -- the argument of counsel for the Government about the jurisdiction of the courts below to enter an order of habeas corpus with respect to these men who were confined in Alcatraz?"
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5767.285,5778.372,"Mr. Justice Whittaker, I believe the contention that habeas corpus was not a proper vehicle for securing the remedy which the petitioner in Number 180 sought."
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5798.736,5800.16,I'm not talking about proper remedy.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5802.497,5818.957,"Jurisdiction, we believe that in effect that the Department of Justice has answered its own point when it has said that the vital incident of this case is not the written judgment but it is rather the oral pronouncement of the judge in open court."
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5840.497,5843.075,I think I had made myself clear.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5855.304,5856.904,Yes sir.
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5856.904,5860.032,These men were incarcerated in Alcatraz.
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5863.436,5863.911,"Oh no, sir."
1960.180,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5895.205,5897.393,Well not habeas corpus (Inaudible)
1960.180,2,24528,frederick_m_rowe,,5897.393,5904.057,"So the question to which you eluded and which I misunderstood, I don't believe is the case."
1960.180,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6062.549,6089.592,"Mr. Rowe, before you sit down, I should like to express the appreciation of the Court to you for having accepted the assignment of the Court to represent this indigent defendant as public service.We're always comforted by thought that lawyers are willing to take such cases and pursue them with the diligence and understanding that you have."
