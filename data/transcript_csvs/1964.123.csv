1964.123,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.697,"Number 123, Federal Power Commission, Petitioner, versus Union Electric Company."
1964.123,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,40.361,44.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3066.769,3075.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.928,3355.883,How do you know what (Inaudible)?
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3355.883,3356.756,I beg your pardon?
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.756,3359.391,How do you know they should file a declaration of intention?
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3359.391,3363.619,Or -- the statute is plain Your Honor.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.737,3375.796,That's just as clear as it can be.
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3375.796,3377.659,It certainly is.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.659,3381.143,And that regulates when you're supposed to file a declaration.
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3381.143,3382.535,Absolutely.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.535,3388.979,And -- so that has really nothing to do with what kind of a finding the Commission was make later.
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3388.979,3395.515,"No, that -- it may or may not affect navigable capacity downstream which we think is the tests."
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.515,3402.227,So the jurisdiction it could -- the jurisdiction is at least goes to the extent of making -- a file of declaration?
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3402.227,3402.716,Yes sir.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.624,3412.348,You don't have any problem at all in deciding whether this is a non-navigable stream over which Congress has jurisdiction?
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3412.348,3421.039,"No, this undoubtedly as Congress has jurisdiction over every non-navigable tributary of a navigable water."
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.254,3442.097,So this provision there -- defining where -- when you're supposed to file a declaration has nothing to do with the content of this later language as to the finding that Congress must make?
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3442.097,3443.788,Yes it has Your Honor.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.982,3525.155,If you wouldn't -- I suppose you would say that the Congress could have wanted to require the licensing of any interstate electrical --
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3525.155,3525.539,"Oh, I think --"
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.539,3526.545,-- claim
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3526.545,3530.037,The interstate feature has nothing to do with it in our opinion.
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.037,3534.509,"Well, I know but I'm just saying that you would agree that Congress could regulate all --"
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3534.509,3534.786,I have --
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.786,3539.786,"-- steam and water plants, if they're going to carry electricity interstate?"
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3539.786,3545.096,"Oh, I would not -- well, I am -- under its general commerce power, Your Honor, it may."
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3545.096,3546.453,"Yes, yes."
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3546.453,3548.714,"Yes, I have admitted in the brief."
1964.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.054,3574.079,"Well, aren't they -- isn't the Government in effect arguing or saying that Congress is saying that you require a license for all plants which carry power interstate if they're build on the stream?"
1964.123,1,39720,robert_j_keefe,,3574.079,3575.445,That's right.
