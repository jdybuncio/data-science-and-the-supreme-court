1974.74-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.883,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 74-201, City of Richmond against the United States."
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,54.883,58.146,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.884,143.429,What voting age is not registered voters?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,143.429,147.21,That's the voting age population according to census figures.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,147.21,149.437,From 42 to 37.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,149.437,165.618,"From 44.8 to 37.3, those are the only figures available the census figures of population by age, we don't have figures unregistered voters by race."
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,165.618,174.268,"Of course, as part of annexation, the populations of the annex territory were not registered voters and Richmond could not have been?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,174.268,178.009,Not in Richmond that is correct Mr. Justice.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.881,288.045,"There are two ways to annex as I understand it, one by majority of vote or both the annexor or annexee and the other by Court orders, special annexation Court that is."
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,288.045,290.684,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1974.74-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.642,324.339,"Mr. -- Mr. Wallace, are you and Mr. Rhyne dividing as between issues?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,324.339,328.57,"No sir, we haven't planned to do that."
1974.74-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.862,364.039,"Well, I've got a question that somewhere along the line, since the Attorney General now apparently has approved the Richmond plan, why isn't this moot so far as in Section 1973 (c) is concerned under the Voting Rights Act."
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,364.039,377.352,"Well, we have changed our position in the litigation as a result of modifications of the plan but that doesn't mean that there has been a submission to us and we've interposed no objection."
1974.74-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,404.583,409.033,You mean that these matters can never be disposed of by compromise once the proceeding has commenced in the --
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,409.033,416.852,"Well, there are two intervenors who didn't agree with the compromise and we just took the position --"
1974.74-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.852,425.035,These intervenors normally mean maintain a live lawsuit when the plaintiff and the defendant have compromised it?
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.035,427.463,They can in an antitrust litigation anyway.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,427.463,434.967,"There -- yes, there have been instances upheld, the El Paso case --"
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.967,435.105,The El Paso case.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,435.105,439.439,-- being cited to us.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.978,546.125,"May I ask Mr. Wallace how long the at large system had been in effect, since about 1950?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,546.125,552.377,"I think it's 1947 if I -- 48, 1948 the city attorney tells me."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.377,567.758,"That was considered -- I'm sure quite a reform in the structure of the municipal government when it came along is a generally political scientist think that to be an enlightened form of government, a small council elected at large and with the city manager system?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,567.758,570.318,"With the city manager system, yes."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,570.318,574.646,"And that came in at 48, how large a council, how many members?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,574.646,576.145,It was a nine-member council.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.145,581.905,"Oh, from the beginning, so this involves no change in the number of members of the council?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,581.905,582.667,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.667,589.267,-- but simply it changes from -- ultimately from at large election to an order or district election.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,589.267,598.338,"We were in a situation where there was an emerging black majority, which would be frustrated by the annexation --"
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,598.338,600.934,Assuming black voting?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,600.934,602.992,"Yes, which is not --"
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.992,615.267,"What had been the history -- what had been the history between 1948 and 1969 from the point of view racial identity of the membership of the council, had it been all white always?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,615.267,620.874,There has been one black member of it in more recent years.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.327,636.67,Has it been a non-partisan kind of ballot?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,636.67,642.469,"Well, it's not the traditional political parties and the ballot itself is non-partisan but there are --"
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.469,644.143,No -- no part of designation on the part -- on the part --
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,644.143,645.614,There are organizations --
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,645.614,647.295,Organizations that nominate slates?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,647.295,650.503,"That support candidates, yes."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,650.503,656.23,And has it been any kind of preferential type voting such as proportional representation?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,656.23,657.159,No.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,657.159,658.682,Does the voter marks nine-access?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,658.682,659.402,They're not --
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.402,660.266,Up to nine-access?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,660.266,666.01,"Up to nine-access, they are not numbered seats and you don't have to have a majority to win."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.01,668.167,The highest nine are elected.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,668.167,669.46,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.46,671.954,And the voter --
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,671.954,672.984,Can vote for as many as he wants.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.984,681.377,"It has alleged on this -- on the ballot with no party designations and he puts up to nine access, no more than that?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,681.377,683.084,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.084,685.103,"They are not proportional representation, never has been?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,685.103,701.648,"It is not proportional representation and in the course of the litigation, since the city brought the lawsuit, still seeking approval for the at large system with the annexation."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.69,757.198,And the districts of approximately equal population.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,757.198,778.697,"Approximately equal population, they were drawn on a nonracial basis or on the basis of contiguity, compactness, sharing of interest, not having a district crossing the James River criteria of that sort which are spelled out in some detail."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.208,953.409,Citywide vote.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,953.409,954.202,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.202,954.727,At large vote.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,954.727,962.226,"That -- that is correct, and that was inescapably an at large vote and the ward plan couldn't do anything about that."
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.677,1065.265,Summary affirmance in this Court.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1065.265,1067.817,There was a summary affirmance in this Court --
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.817,1069.467,Without an argument.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1069.467,1073.531,Without argument.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.583,1143.544,Suppose there is a city council as elected at large and the black vote in the community is potentially more than 50% or is more than 50%.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1179.365,1186.1,"Not as we have been administering the Act, we don't think the Act requires one method of representation or the other."
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.1,1192.485,So that although the -- although blacks before could have elected all the council members.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1205.191,1207.827,"No, that would not --"
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.827,1209.615,"That is sort of a problem here, isn't it?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1209.615,1220.609,There might be a racially discriminatory purpose in making the change but the effect if the districts are fairly drawn would not be in effect that violates the Act in our view.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.609,1231.374,And that is rather involved here because the argument is that soon blacks could have controlled the city council and elect and had a majority in the instance?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1231.374,1244.815,But that in our view so far as effect is concerned is made up for by the fact that the black voting strength is being immediately enhanced now.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.815,1280.41,"We have another case suggested by my Brother White's question, let's assume a city with a 55% majority of Negroes of voting age who in fact didn't exercise their potential and therefore the majority of the council in fact historically has been non-Negro and then you annex property and that reduces that majority from 55 to 51 and you continue the at large, now would that be a violation of anything?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1287.805,1290.018,"Well, we have to look at the circumstances, it might not --"
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.018,1294.557,But there has been a slight reduction in the majority?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1294.557,1297.936,There might not any reason to interpose an objection there.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.901,1300.008,In the abstract?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1300.008,1305.749,-- of this kind in the abstract (Voice Overlap) without hearing from interested persons who may bring facts to our attention.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.749,1307.707,"Well, we haven't read the facts suppose."
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1307.707,1310.675,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1406.441,1409.728,"What is the council and what is the term under law by him, two-year term?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1409.728,1410.923,Two-year term.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1410.923,1412.576,And the election is odd numbered years or even numbers?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1412.576,1414.361,The even numbered years so that --
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.361,1418.24,The gubernatorial are odd numbered years in Virginia and the -- and as far as the --
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1418.24,1428.257,And the city would prefer not to wait until 1976 for the next election and we don't see why they -- that need occur here.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.257,1432.9,Is the school or is the school district coterminous with municipal boundaries?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1432.9,1433.971,It is in Virginia.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.971,1434.87,Precisely.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1434.87,1446.297,"It's precisely coterminous so that a deannexation would have something of the effect that was involved in the United States against Scotland, Neck City Board of Education."
1974.74-201,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1457.663,1466.227,"Mr. Wallace, in the last five years, has any councilman died or anything and if so how is his replacement selected?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1466.227,1467.776,The replacements are being made.
1974.74-201,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1475.005,1477.512,Even so perpetuating that as of the moment?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1477.512,1484.309,That's -- elections have been enjoined under first in order of this Court in joining the 1970 --
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.309,1502.572,"The Government -- the Government under this has been administering the statute to say I understand -- I would gather that even if in your judgment there is no dilutive effect, no bad effect at all, a bad purpose would still upset a plan?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1502.572,1505.105,Well the Act says that.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.102,1515.956,"Because it is perfectly -- it's perfectly clear that there's bad effect, you don't have to have a bad purpose too."
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1515.956,1516.253,That is correct.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.253,1523.756,"But the other way around, I suppose the cases are few in far between where there is no bad effect but -- yet there's a bad purpose?"
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1523.756,1528.819,We think that this case is a peculiar example of that.
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.819,1532.649,And yet you are willing to remand on purpose even though you think there is no effect?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1532.649,1539.666,"Well, we don' think the party has developed their evidence and the question of whether there is a legitimate purpose."
1974.74-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.228,1570.305,Has there ever been a Court decision under this Act that said that the effect was good but the purpose was bad?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1570.305,1573.567,I am not aware of any.
1974.74-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.567,1586.478,The statute by its terms does require the state of political subdivision to get it -- a declaratory judgment to the effect that the procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1590.548,1593.347,On both issues and --
1974.74-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.347,1598.604,I guess you would say it depends whatever the effects are?
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1598.604,1611.876,"Well, it seems to us that the plain language says that we're not suppose to approve and the District Court is not supposed to approve a voting change that was made for a racially discriminatory purpose even though it doesn't have a racial one."
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.876,1613.885,Even though the facts say they (Voice Overlap).
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1613.885,1616.197,That's regardless of the effect.
1974.74-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.197,1618.317,That's right.
1974.74-201,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1618.317,1621.713,And so that issue remains here.
1974.74-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.576,1647.853,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1649.066,1655.024,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.208,1743.448,On the nine-member council.
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1743.448,1744.871,On the nine-member.
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.728,2069.92,"You can almost under these very peculiar statutes, you could almost make a stronger argument than that I should think that the Attorney General's agreement to the stipulation almost remove jurisdiction from the Court."
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2069.92,2092.146,"Your Honor, I made that argument that is part of justices I didn't quite get them to agree with me.I think it is a good argument because you can see that while there are 37% of the voting populations under the new city, they are given four seats and a chance of another one in the swing ward that is gradually turning but from white to black."
1974.74-201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2092.146,2110.061,"But regardless of the merits, once the Attorney General approve it even though he was late in doing so, if you think in not preempt terms that defeated any course jurisdiction because how did you approved it before the lawsuit, there could have would have been no lawsuit."
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2110.061,2110.568,That is right.
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.568,2111.665,And no need for a lawsuit.
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2111.665,2114.481,"That is right, that is absolutely right."
1974.74-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.928,2252.503,Didn't the court below look in to economics with the thought of looking at the purpose of the annexation that if it wasn't justified by economics means that would at least supported inference that it was justified by prohibited motives?
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2252.503,2272.748,"I suppose Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that is one way that it could be read but my point there is if they were consider economics why didn't they look at all the economics that are in the record in the annexation Court which was stipulated in, they didn't do that."
1974.74-201,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2283.29,2290.471,"If I might get back to the agreement that Richmond reached within the Attorney General, was that before the Court below."
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2290.471,2298.94,"Yes, it was, yes it was because immediately after the Attorney General agreed to it and then when --"
1974.74-201,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2298.94,2301.189,Is there any discussion other than the opinion.
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2301.189,2301.757,Pardon?
1974.74-201,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2301.757,2304.68,Is there any discussion offered in the opinion.
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2304.68,2307.035,Not at all.
1974.74-201,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2307.035,2307.767,(Voice Overlap) a reference to that.
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2307.767,2308.866,Not all.
1974.74-201,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2312.254,2316.765,Had it been before the master?
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2316.765,2327.991,"I think the timing of it was that the consent degree came before the master was appointed and it was before him, yes."
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.991,2333.014,"Isn't the ward plan that the three-judge court talks about, isn't that the plan?"
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2333.014,2337.327,"Attached to the consent judgment, yes, yes it is."
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.327,2340.635,"Well, did the master have that before?"
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2340.635,2343.015,"Yes, he did but he paid no attention to it."
1974.74-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.295,2350.329,"Part of the consent decree but not all of it, isn't that about it?"
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2350.329,2352.457,"Yes, yes, and so --"
1974.74-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.457,2365.118,"On page 18, it says Richmond undertook the development ward plan after the decision in the City of Pittsburgh and it now relies on Petersburg to argue that the annexation was made lawful by the adoption of a single-member district plan, is that the plan?"
1974.74-201,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,2365.118,2366.081,"Yes, it is."
1974.74-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.058,2392.976,Very wellm Mr. Rhyne.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2395.425,2400.858,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.753,2524.446,"On your facts, there was at least one Negro city council along before 1960?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2524.446,2526.365,"Not to my understanding, I maybe mistaken of my impression --"
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.365,2528.748,His name is Oliver W. Hill.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2528.748,2530.036,"Yes, that is correct."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2580.051,2585.708,"Well, is it your position, Mr. Derfner that if the purpose is bad, you don't have to get to the effect?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2585.708,2586.618,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.03,2609.466,You don't suggest that because there was at one time a bad purpose that it is forever bad and incurable.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2609.466,2610.969,"No, not at all --"
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.969,2627.131,"Well, and the argument here is that a plan or change and vision it had a bad purpose and a bad effect that the argument is no longer has either one of them because the effect has been cured and presumably the purpose."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2627.131,2629.758,"Well, it is that presumably that counts."
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.528,2851.637,Was this issue ever presented to this three-judge court as to whether or not the Attorney General's agreement ousted the Court's power?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2851.637,2854.545,I don't think it was presented in any full sense.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.555,2857.772,"Well, that is one of the questions presented here."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2857.772,2861.055,"Well my recollection -- I understand that, Your Honor, Mr. Justice White."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.786,2978.369,"Certainly, the statutory language gives no intimation of that sort of a legislative purpose that consent of the Attorney General is valid only in the case of some things that are covered by the declaratory judgment portion of the statute but not all of them."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,2978.369,2997.321,"But this Court in Georgia, in the Georgia case made it clear that the Attorney General operates as a surrogate for the Court, as a substitute if you will and I think it would be improper to say that the surrogate can swallow up the Court once the jurisdiction of the Court is attached."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3023.189,3040.612,"Yes, but if the Attorney General is given a formal submission and approves it under the language of the statute then there is no action for a declaratory judgment in the District of Columbia, is that -- you agree with that don't you?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3040.612,3043.117,In the ordinary case that is true.
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.117,3047.759,What case other than the ordinary case -- where would you find jurisdiction for that sort of an action?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3047.759,3052.201,"I don't think that the attorney -- well, I think that the jurisdiction ones it attaches of the District Court."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.201,3068.835,"Well, I'm talking about a case where a jurisdiction is never the Attorney General has approved and then an action is sought to be brought by someone else presumably since neither the city has to bring it and the Attorney General chooses not to bring it."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3075.145,3114.879,"The only action available at that point would be an action by a voter presumably seeking to review under either the Administrative Procedure Act or under the intertices of this Act seeking to review the Attorney General's failure to object but clearly, there is no question, but that the declaratory judgment court created under Section 5 would not be invoked if the Attorney General, if the Attorney General's fail -- if the Attorney General had had a submission and failed to object without jurisdiction having attached but it seems that once the Courts jurisdiction has attached, we have an entirely different matter."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.879,3121.939,"The voter even if the Attorney General had approved, would still under the last sense have an action I take it in the Eastern District of Virginia."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3121.939,3122.967,Under the Fifteenth Amendment.
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.967,3124.177,Under the Fifteenth Amendment.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3124.177,3125.449,"Yes, unquestionably"
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3125.449,3132.619,Quite apart from the statute just as anybody withstanding or is would or could have.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3132.619,3134.115,"Yes, no question about that."
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3134.115,3134.29,Quite apart from the statute.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3134.29,3140.082,I think the last sentence was essentially a savings clause to make it clear that it preserves any case could not be ousted.
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3140.082,3140.811,Right.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3140.811,3159.305,"But it seems to me that it is quite wrong to read the statute is saying that the Attorney General can to use a colloquialism pull the plug on a case filed before an Article 3 Court, a special Court created by Congress."
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.305,3165.088,"The only two parties in the case where the city brings the case, doesn't it?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3165.088,3165.727,Yes.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.727,3167.142,And who does it sue?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3167.142,3170.804,It sues the -- it sues United States.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.186,3183.803,"Alright, it sues the -- one now and then, let's assume two weeks after the case is filed, there the plaintiff moved to dismiss it."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3189.546,3191.907,"No, I think that the Court would --"
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.907,3198.588,"Well, what if the city has made a settlement with the Attorney General and he just moves to dismiss?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3198.588,3200.829,I don't think the Court is disempowered to.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.829,3206.291,"Well, I would think he would say because the Attorney General in the city will just pull the plug on the case or both."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3206.291,3221.512,"No, I am saying I think the Court still has at that point has to review and has discretion, I think if not disempowered to dismiss but I don't think the dismissal automatically has to follow and I think this Court has dealt with the rights of --"
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.512,3223.837,The fact is that the city never moved to dismiss in this case.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3223.837,3245.923,"Should never move to dismiss and I would just remind this Court again of its opinion in the -- its paired opinion I suppose, in pair of decisions in the New York case in which the rights of the intervenors have been a matter of great concern not only to the Court but to the Justice Department that has been a continuing controversy."
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3272.011,3282.784,"Mr. Derfner, on your suit in the Eastern District of Virginia by our citizen under the Fifteenth Amendment, does that mean any citizen?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3282.784,3283.764,Any citizen withstanding?
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.764,3288.297,The Fifteenth Amendment gives no right to whites --
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3288.297,3289.772,Pardon me?
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.772,3299.948,"Well, the Fifteenth Amendment says, it said the United States voter shall not be denied or abridged on the account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3301.341,3304.335,It would be a black citizen in the ordinary case.
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3308.554,3310.356,You want to amend the Fifteenth Amendment?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3310.356,3310.885,Pardon me.
1974.74-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3310.885,3312.499,You want to amend the Fifteenth Amendment?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3312.499,3323.015,"No, no, I certainly don't mean to do so and in fact the suit that has been brought, that was brought in the eastern district was by a black citizen seeking to assert his Fifteenth amendment rights."
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3323.015,3329.838,Not in a certain context under the Fifteenth Amendment a white citizen could have standing.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3329.838,3330.108,Yes.
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.108,3340.436,"His claims were that in a majority where there were black majority in the particular governmental unit, there was discrimination against white voters."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3340.436,3344.328,"That's the limit of the point I was seeking to make in response to your question, Mr. Justice."
1974.74-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3344.328,3345.971,White race is a race?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3345.971,3363.924,"Yes and they are entitled to protection, so I was just talking about the ordinary situation and the Virginia situation being one in which as a practical matter white citizens have never been discriminated against on account of race."
1974.74-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.924,3377.646,"In other words you agree that because the objectives of the amendment were at the moment of its adoption, one race it doesn't confine or define its scope?"
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3377.646,3379.377,"Unquestionably, unquestionably."
1974.74-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.196,3395.405,That's a factual issue though.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3395.405,3396.565,"Yes it is, yes it is."
1974.74-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.565,3397.182,Constitutional issue.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3397.182,3403.503,"But as to the constitutional issue, certainly, the Fifteenth Amendment goes as we might say both ways or always."
1974.74-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.503,3408.183,Always.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3408.183,3411.445,Let me direct myself in the time remaining to the question of effect.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.696,3546.023,"What's your view of the question I asked your colleague, if there is a city council elected at large and the blacks have potential majority or an actual majority and then the city is single districted so that the blacks can no longer elect all of a council."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3546.023,3561.547,I don't think that's dilution because I think in that large election the sub position that you might get all nine or virtually all nine of the councilmen is in a sense of bonus that flows from the mechanism and to come back from that to.
1974.74-201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.547,3573.695,"Well, single districting as long as the single districts weren't drawn to dilute themselves to black power would be all right."
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3573.695,3584.49,"Yes, yes, at least in the ordinary situation where you are not coming on the heels of an annexation of this sort and when you are coming on the heels of an annexation of this sort, some different standards may apply."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3830.252,3842.309,But it isn't one of the legitimate problems of many large cities of problem of white flight and don't you -- is it totally ruled out under this Act?
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3842.309,3842.523,"No, no."
1974.74-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3842.523,3853.893,To take that into consideration and trying to get more white people into a metropolitan area where that thing is rapidly tipping.
1974.74-201,2,15872,armand_derfner,,3853.893,3859.757,"I don't think that -- no, I don't that's ruled out but I think in this case what we had was much, much more."
1974.74-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3893.719,3894.199,Very well.
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,3907.237,3908.453,"It makes no difference to me, Your Honor."
1974.74-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3908.453,3910.267,"Alright, you may proceed."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,3910.267,3914.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3976.835,3978.413,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,3978.413,3984.82,Thank you sir.
1974.74-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3984.82,3988.141,"Mr. Venable, you may resume."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,3988.141,3992.082,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4020.497,4025.925,Sometimes of course we flash those issues out on our own as you're probably aware.
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4025.925,4028.306,Yes sir.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4029.623,4033.523,Arguably it's jurisdictional.
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4033.523,4038.456,Jurisdictional to the Court that the Attorney General has presented a consent order.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4038.456,4041.629,"Well, that the Attorney General in the city now have agreed."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4041.629,4053.742,"I think they agreed as to affect to Mr. Justice White, I don't think they agreed the purpose and that's why the Attorney General went on with the trial and even suggest today that we go back and consider even more the question of purpose."
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4070.097,4074.382,Are you saying the effect that the Attorney General was drew from the consent order?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4074.382,4077.818,"Yes sir, I do."
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4403.94,4417.766,Are you argue -- do you argue the mere fact of converting from a multimember to a permanent large to a single member district system had a dilutive effect?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4417.766,4421.897,"Per se diluted effect, Mr. Justice White, no sir, I don't argue that."
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4425.337,4433.219,"Well, tell me -- you said a moment ago that the purpose was to use a single member district plan to maintain white supremacy, how would it do that?"
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4433.219,4436.034,It would do it this fashion.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4443.245,4447.863,You mean it's the type of a single member plan is the way they drew their districts?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4447.863,4448.615,Yes sir.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4461.309,4472.387,"Well, I thought you said per se, you wouldn't say that a single member district plan was dilutive even though if it were at large the blacks might get on that."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4472.387,4474.892,I would not like it but I think in the context of what we -- what the cases have held.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4474.892,4477.321,What do you mean you don't like what?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4478.592,4511.088,"I would not like the change of an at large system in the context of your first questions I believe earlier today that where black citizens have played the democratic process, have given adherence to the whole concept of work within the democratic system and have worked hard to gain their political position to have that rug jerked out at he last minute just when they were within grasp of political control, I think would violate all the standards of fair play in the democratic process."
1974.74-201,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4618.725,4623.393,"Mr. Venable, do you support an election promptly?"
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4623.393,4624.473,Do I support an election?
1974.74-201,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4631.307,4633.669,Only limited to the old city?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4633.669,4635.562,Yes sir.
1974.74-201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4692.293,4699.14,"It wasn't all that clear that it was about annexations at the time this annexation took place, was it?"
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4699.14,4702.66,I would agree with you Mr. Justice Rehnquist except for this fact.
1974.74-201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4723.452,4727.099,"Well, that isn't quite clear."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4727.099,4727.932,To effect voting.
1974.74-201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4727.932,4746.947,It's a very debatable question whether it -- to my mind whether you know you had to reach the results you did in Allen and in Perkins and I think a fair minded lawyer could conclude that an annexation was not within the statutory language.
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4746.947,4755.341,"Be that -- be that as it may, the fact remains that once it was clear, once it was clear what did the city do?"
1974.74-201,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4879.68,4886.756,"Mr. Venable, a little while ago before some questions came, you were speaking of deannexation."
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4890.307,4892.367,"Yes sir, I am."
1974.74-201,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4892.367,4894.168,Was it denied to you below?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4894.168,4895.707,"No sir, it was not."
1974.74-201,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4961.197,4963.615,You took no cross petition here?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4963.615,4965.998,No I did not sir.
1974.74-201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4965.998,4971.436,You can't enlarge the relief granted you by the District Court and I believe under our rules?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,4971.436,4974.571,I understand that Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.74-201,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5012.411,5015.521,Was there a reason you didn't cross petition?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,5015.521,5018.098,Was there a reason at the time I did not cross petition?
1974.74-201,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5053.4,5056.097,What petition would have better protected your rights wouldn't it?
1974.74-201,3,20256,cabell_venable,,5056.097,5061.683,Yes it would and I'm in error if I have denigrated my rights in that respect.
1974.74-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5064.485,5069.353,"Thank you, Mr. Venable."
1974.74-201,4,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,5071.69,5074.062,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-201,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5175.245,5183.494,"Get on with the election everybody say that you agree about that but in his way but Mr. Venable just -- so this one, he was talking about that."
1974.74-201,4,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,5192.026,5207.205,An election under the nine ward plan which we feel is the only fair election where the black citizen of Richmond will have full representation and participation in the political process because they are there guaranteed four seats.
1974.74-201,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5334.429,5340.325,"Well, don't you have to persuade us that the District Court is finding against during that point is clearly erroneous?"
1974.74-201,4,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,5340.325,5345.369,And we urge that it is Your Honor that evidence is overwhelmingly against that finding.
1974.74-201,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5430.3,5433.396,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
