1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1609.638,1610.438,Pardon me Justice Brennan?
1964.437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1610.438,1617.283,"I thought his position was that in face of that venue statute, there was no Ohio court which actually what I thought."
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1617.283,1619.521,"I'm coming to that Justice Brennan, that is correct."
1964.437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1619.521,1624.841,"But it could be that the defendant didn't raise the venue, could he go on in the court?"
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1624.841,1629.61,"Then you're being of course only jurisdictional if the defendant raises it, he could go on of course venue can be waived upon."
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.61,1631.491,(Voice Overlap)
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1631.491,1631.95,Pardon me Justice?
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.95,1633.878,The case could be filed in the court?
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1633.878,1637.219,The case could be filed and I'll discuss that in quite —
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.219,1647.85,"But you said he's brought them in the wrong court, he brought them in the wrong court only if you -- if your clients thought it was a wrong court or one of it in a different court."
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1647.85,1654.358,"Well, in fact it would have to be the wrong court if we assert that position and obtain an motion to quash our summons."
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.358,1672.724,"That's true, that's true, but if you for example what if they had asked your client for where do you wanted, well, was it the federal court or a state court – he says lets file up in the state court and you had to raise it at all if it have been filed in the right court."
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1672.724,1682.406,"Then that court, yes Your Honor, then that court could have gone through to a decision without an objection being raised by the defendant."
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.267,1931.452,I notice you don't deal with the Herb in your brief.
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1931.452,1932.371,"No I don't, Your Honor."
1964.437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.154,1944.472,"Because that your statement, you just made simply covers Herb single case cited by (Voice Overlap)"
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,1944.472,1950.141,I certainly believe it does Your Honor and I intend to point that out orally.
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1994.019,2003.139,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2003.139,2008.78,"In general, Justice Goldberg, there is venue in personal injury actions ---"
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2008.78,2012.799,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2012.799,2026.206,Simply because the action here was filed against a railroad company and there is a separate section in Ohio's Revised Code pertaining to venue against railway companies.
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2055.402,2058.358,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2058.358,2060.695,"Yes, it is, Justice Goldberg."
1964.437,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.255,2122.894,You don't about that –-
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2122.894,2123.784,Pardon me Mr. Justice?
1964.437,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.784,2125.614,You don't know about that?
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2125.614,2133.56,I don't know about their feelings and I'm not willing to subscribe to the expressions that have been urged on me.
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2148.729,2151.579,Do you think it's necessary to argue that to us?
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2151.579,2152.386,"No I don't, Your Honor."
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2152.386,2153.15,So why you're doing?
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2153.15,2163.568,"On the other hand, I felt this way, there is no place to go after this Court and I feel obliged to bring before this Court every thought I have relative to this case."
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2163.568,2167.469,"No, no place for the other man to go either after this Court?"
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2167.469,2181.844,"Well Your Honor, if we may deviate from the record for a moment I appreciate that and I respect that fact and we as attorneys carry insurance for such situations and I don't need to go any further there."
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2188.32,2190.814,You are.
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2190.814,2204.668,"In conclusion I would like to mention to the Court that and most respectfully urge the Court to bear in mind, this is a Federal Law with which we are dealing."
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2246.427,2251.303,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2251.303,2277.122,"It does Justice Goldberg, precisely it does and I again would like to urge at this point upon the Court, I'm not expressing in doing an attempt to express my feeling about the merits of the venue section in reference to service upon railroads, but I'm simply saying that under the present existing law, this situation should not be permitted to exist."
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2400.241,2405.948,"Mr. Cole, you want to add something typical --"
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2405.948,2411.528,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2411.528,2418.918,"Yes, Your Honor the subject matter was obtained by the Court that is it had jurisdiction over the subject matter."
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2418.918,2429.548,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2429.548,2445.843,"Yes, Your Honor as a matter of fact as I'm sure this Court well knows, if the case had been properly filed in the State Court to begin with and if the Court had the venue, then of course the case could not have been removed under any circumstances by the defendant."
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2445.843,2483.656,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2483.656,2498.764,"I think Justice Goldberg, however, in taking that statement and I would certainly agree with you that take in its context as you read it, it would be applicable, but I think an entire reading if the case changes that."
1964.437,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2498.764,2500.069,[Inaudible]
1964.437,1,40564,roy_w_short,,2500.069,2501.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.437,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2501.579,2503.531,Mr. Cole.
