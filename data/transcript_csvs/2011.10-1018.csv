2011.10-1018,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.621,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,7.417,9.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1018,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,45.352,49.68,"Is that across the board, Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated?"
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,74.153,86.679,"I think it -- it may well be the latter rule, the more broader one, but for these purposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation when they are working in -- in coordination with or under direct supervision of government employees."
2011.10-1018,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,126.726,133.629,Why does it matter whether the privately retained attorney works in close cooperation with government employees?
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,145.311,151.511,"I don't think that would, but in this -- but I think it depends on what one means by coordination with or supervision."
2011.10-1018,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.341,199.292,And I suppose -- I suppose you can argue that there is a built-in limitation because the question doesn't even come up unless there is State action.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,221.687,222.155,Right.
2011.10-1018,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.011,316.383,"But your test -- and this is, I think goes broader than the articulation of the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much assurance by itself."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,343.936,344.778,"Well, two responses to that."
2011.10-1018,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,386.087,402.301,Suppose -- suppose the government hires an attorney to do an independent investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely because it does not want to be faced with allegations that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation because its own conduct is at issue.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,411.219,416.527,"--It -- it would in this sense, because there would be -- and I am assuming here we are not talking like a Bivens appointment or something like that."
2011.10-1018,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,439.768,442.689,What is the difference between that and the prison situation?
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,458.575,461.027,--The difference is -- there is a practical difference and then a legal doctrinal difference.
2011.10-1018,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,536.276,537.072,Why isn't that the case here?
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,537.072,537.493,I'm sorry?
2011.10-1018,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.493,556.425,"It seems to me that there is enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who held the investigation; the people who attended the meeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the other personnel that were there were acceding to what he was doing."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,580.599,580.848,No--
2011.10-1018,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.848,585.208,--the individual under the control of the agency.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,585.208,587.614,--First of all -- a couple of responses.
2011.10-1018,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.978,617.991,"This argument seems to fall under what Justice Scalia termed the functional test, that he's serving just like any other government lawyer."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,624.02,641.417,"--I do that -- first of all I'm putting it right in -- in Richardson's language, which said it was reserving this very question, and that is, when an attorney or any individual who's working in close coordination or under the supervision of government officials in the performance of an essential function."
2011.10-1018,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.02,654.441,So -- so independent counsel would not be covered.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,677.666,678.103,No.
2011.10-1018,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.493,678.836,Why?
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,686.163,689.958,"--Yes, but independent counsel still sued in the name of the United States."
2011.10-1018,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.829,702.343,Excuse me.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,712.06,715.464,This Court assumed that question but did not answer it in that--
2011.10-1018,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.464,719.758,"Well, the -- the whole issue would have been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be sued."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,719.758,734.72,"--This part assumes -- I think it's fair to assume when you're operating a prison, although I think to -- there's a reason this Court reserved it, because the question there is -- with certainly the corporation was under color of law, whether the individuals who worked for the corporation would also be under the color of law."
2011.10-1018,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.72,749.153,"Don't you think the -- the two should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be sued for acting under color of law you ought to have the defenses that people who were acting with legal authority have?"
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,749.153,757.805,"Well, this Court's already crossed that bridge in cases like Wyatt, where, for example -- and it does -- because the State law requirement can sweep broadly in some situations."
2011.10-1018,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,796.523,801.96,Lawyers -- lawyers are not supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation.
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,818.33,819.188,--There are a couple of reasons.
2011.10-1018,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.39,907.028,"Ms. Millett, our cases have said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but also to history."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,924.267,931.798,They would have had the same sort of good faith defense that this Court in Harlow turned into qualified immunity.
2011.10-1018,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,932.656,943.153,"But in Wyatt, we said that that was a very different kind of immunity than the Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no basis for giving Harlow immunity."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,943.153,946.886,--It -- it -- the Harlow immunity came from the same root.
2011.10-1018,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,965.095,969.33,"So I take it your answer is, yes, it would only have been a malice defense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt."
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,972.735,983.638,--The answer -- the answer is that it is the same type of defense that this Court recognized in prior cases as supporting qualified immunity when needed to protect the decisions of the government.
2011.10-1018,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,986.789,993.789,"Doesn't that suggest really that we don't have a historical test any more, that really all we're looking to is policy considerations?"
2011.10-1018,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,993.789,996.397,"--Not this case at all, because you've got layers."
2011.10-1018,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1024.79,1025.448,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2011.10-1018,1,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1033.646,1034.398,Oh.
2011.10-1018,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.757,1035.256,That's all right.
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1041.362,1052.858,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1018,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1080.439,1087.622,"So if they don't work closely together at all and it's just this one fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have qualified immunity?"
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1087.622,1091.479,"No, this is a situation in which there's a very close working relationship--"
2011.10-1018,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1091.479,1091.823,I'm sorry?
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1092.871,1096.026,--He likely would have qualified immunity.
2011.10-1018,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.731,1137.525,It's -- it's just hard to imagine anything more imbued with State action than imprisoning someone.
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1140.008,1141.241,--Right.
2011.10-1018,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1166.606,1172.885,Wasn't Richardson really all about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary?
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1179.85,1188.441,"--Well, we understand the Court's discussion of market forces to be really important in the context there, where you don't have individuals who are working closely with government."
2011.10-1018,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1233.593,1237.033,"Do you think market forces do operate differently here, or is it basically the same thing?"
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1237.033,1247.229,"--We do think that there is a difference in that the attorney in this situation has private clients that that attorney can work for, whereas the private prison company really could only work for the government."
2011.10-1018,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1247.541,1261.755,"I thought that in this case the firm the lawyer was associated with said its dominant business was giving advice to local governments, local municipal governments."
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1261.755,1264.27,--Yes.
2011.10-1018,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.528,1295.989,"You seem to assume or to acknowledge or to concede that market forces do not operate for government employment, that all government employees are doing it out of love?"
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1309.391,1317.167,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I didn't mean to suggest that we thought that the market forces inquiry was particularly relevant to answering the qualified immunity question."
2011.10-1018,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1375.285,1377.364,"Well, that would be a breach of his duty as an attorney."
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1377.364,1378.331,--I'm saying--
2011.10-1018,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1378.331,1381.97,And he would be subject to malpractice in that case.
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1416.94,1430.634,"--I'm saying that an attorney is in a difficult position there, and it's the same position that a government attorney would be in, and the Court has extended qualified immunity to government attorneys who are in this position, either giving legal advise, like in the Burns case, or serving as prosecutors."
2011.10-1018,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.513,1507.369,--What if it's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department?
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1531.703,1541.811,"--It is just difficult in the fire department situation, even if there is an all-volunteer force, that there wouldn't be some type of direct supervision by the mayor, by the city council, et cetera."
2011.10-1018,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.562,1593.459,"The other part of qualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this case, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize you can't enter a home without a warrant but you can tell the occupant to bring out every item you want to see?"
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1602.44,1606.316,"Well, the Ninth Circuit found that it wasn't clearly established law."
2011.10-1018,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1639.941,1644.472,"Another question that is not teed up, but I guess I'm just curious to know about the history of the case."
2011.10-1018,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1653.234,1659.014,"In terms of the argument, Petitioner conceded throughout the litigation that he was a State actor."
2011.10-1018,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.787,1670.805,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1674.755,1677.583,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1723.094,1724.19,"Well, what about your test?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1726.218,1727.89,"--Well, our test is Richardson."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1735.748,1739.87,"Well, suppose you have a lawyer who is a part-time employee."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1742.151,1743.524,A part-time employee--
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1743.524,1745.914,A part-time employee of government unit.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1745.914,1748.585,"--Well, he would be -- he would receive Harlow immunity."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1748.585,1753.911,"So the difference, your difference, is between an employee and an independent contractor?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1753.911,1754.707,Absolutely.
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1754.707,1757.456,Isn't that often a very difficult determination under the law?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1757.456,1759.484,"No, I don't think so."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1771.857,1775.964,"There are a lot of -- there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot of law firms."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1788.883,1796.564,"--Well, the Court has made a distinction in its past decisions about functions that are integral to the judicial process."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1812.354,1813.746,"Well, now you're talking about history."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1840.937,1843.682,--No I would say that he would not be entitled to qualified immunity.
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1843.682,1844.306,Why?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1844.306,1844.68,Because he's a--
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1844.68,1845.382,He's an employee.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1849.208,1855.49,"--Well, they passed a resolution to hire him and his firm to provide those services on a temporary basis, or a basis of six months."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.576,1870.405,Year-long employment is not employment?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1878.899,1886.925,"--Well, as I understood the hypothetical, if -- if that individual is -- is working as an employee of the city--"
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.925,1887.817,He's working as an employee.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1912.868,1920.694,"--Well, our position here in this case is that Mr. Filarsky was not necessarily acting in a role of an attorney, he was functioning as an internal affairs investigator."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.08,1929.784,It makes it even easier then.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1939.67,1947.433,"--But he has other clients and he works for profit, then he operates in a different system."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.433,1947.776,Okay.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1947.776,1949.804,He is not subject to the same system--
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.804,1954.569,"But if they employed him for a year, exclusive employment, no other clients, you would say that is a different case?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1954.569,1958.96,--If they employed him for longer than a year?
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.96,1964.911,"No, I'm saying a year, in fact 364 days, okay?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1970.658,1976.2,"Well, I think then that that's -- that's where you would have to look at the policy considerations."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.2,1978.091,I understand that.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1982.058,1983.792,"No, I don't think it does."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.384,1994.29,Everybody takes a position to make money for profit.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,1996.708,2004.222,"--But he may be in that instance trying to form a relationship with that municipality, and enter into a longer term contract."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.222,2007.174,"He's -- he may be, I guess."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2024.57,2025.977,Absolutely.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.521,2028.32,"Two years, though?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2034.162,2035.176,The longer you go.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.176,2040.924,"--I'm a lawyer who enters a contract for life with this government to investigate, at that point does he get the immunity?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2040.924,2043.72,"No, because there's--"
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.72,2044.048,Still not.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2044.048,2046.295,--There is no historical basis for immunity.
2011.10-1018,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2057.01,2059.245,But don't we have--
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.245,2062.696,I thought there was a distinction between employees and independent contractors.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2066.427,2074.316,"--Well, the distinction really is, if you are a private actor you are subject to a different set of rules."
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.078,2091.747,"What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln today were there, and I gathered what happened is they thought the local prosecutor was good but Lincoln is better."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2106.209,2115.955,"As a historical basis, there does not appear to be immunity for private prosecutors."
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.703,2138.07,"I'm asking you, in your opinion am I -- when I write this opinion I could say, not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a public prosecutor, brought in for the occasion, in your opinion he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, the local prosecutor would have?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2139.82,2141.586,--I think that that's a much closer call.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.586,2145.912,"If you should say that section 1983 didn't exist, that's your answer, right?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2145.912,2151.284,"But I think it's a much closer call, because he was engaged in a prosecutorial function, which this Court over the years has."
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.284,2159.953,"But investigatory functions they don't get immunity, so if Lincoln had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into this, I don't think we should prosecute."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2163.233,2164.933,No.
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.933,2165.701,--Okay.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2170.744,2171.168,Right.
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.168,2182.114,"Imagine in this case the lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor, and so forth, and they said not necessarily this event, they said we want to do X."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2233.092,2238.294,"I don't think that is necessarily an immunity question, it's more of a liability question."
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.904,2240.591,"No, no, no."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2267.284,2275.984,"--But I think what it is, the difference there, there you have an attorney just providing advice which is different than what happened here, where you actually have an attorney engaged--"
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.984,2276.733,That may be.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2305.581,2319.811,"--If the attorney under those circumstances could be held liable for a constitutional violation for simply giving advice and he happens to be a private attorney working for profit, then he wouldn't have immunity."
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.811,2323.153,I change it slightly and he puts them up to it.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2323.153,2324.482,Well--
2011.10-1018,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.482,2325.699,I don't know why he couldn't.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2330.806,2331.883,--I think the answer's the same.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.145,2346.206,Your case--
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2346.206,2348.658,There is no -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2348.658,2350.047,--Finish your answer.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2350.047,2354.095,There is certainly no -- there is no historical basis of immunity just for giving legal advice.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2360.123,2366.73,"Your case highlights, I think is a very good example of why the lawyer ought to have qualified immunity."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2407.417,2411.881,No.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2432.779,2435.731,"That's easy for a judge to say, because they are absolutely immune--"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2448.272,2452.506,--But for nearly a decade the law within the Ninth Circuit has been that private attorneys don't receive immunity.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.506,2453.036,Right.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2453.036,2460.566,"And that -- the fact that is, is that Mr. Filarsky knew going into that -- that investigation that he wouldn't have immunity for anything he -- he did."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.328,2463.998,"Well, how do you know?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2463.998,2470.967,"--Well, because he, in light of the threats that -- that he received, he still went forward with the -- what was deemed to be an unconstitutional search."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2478.575,2482.26,"Well he had -- he had the chief issue the order, right?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2482.26,2483.508,"--Well, the--"
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.508,2486.835,"And then the chief later on says, well, he told me to issue the order."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2490.694,2501.578,"--Well, Mr. Filarsky said, and this is what he said on the record; it's in the transcripts in the joint appendix, is that he is issuing the order on behalf of the department."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.81,2516.073,"I understand that there's a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given in the Ninth Circuit."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2522.308,2523.868,I don't.
2011.10-1018,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.868,2534.158,Why didn't you cross -- cross-appeal on the clearly established law?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2548.684,2553.246,So why did the Petitioner or Respondent not cross-appeal.
2011.10-1018,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2553.246,2557.244,Why didn't you bring up that -- that issue?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2557.244,2565.507,"I think it was -- that's sort of the law of the case, is that the Ninth Circuit found that there was a constitutional violation."
2011.10-1018,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2569.725,2574.299,But -- but whether it was clearly established?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2592.776,2594.761,Right.
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2606.382,2615.237,"You are saying it's clearly established that there isn't a difference between going in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and telling him to bring it out."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2629.354,2633.62,--I -- I think it's pretty well known that the house is--
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2633.62,2641.302,"Well, particularly -- well, even if -- the reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I have got this stuff at my house."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2652.205,2659.516,"--Yes, I do because it -- it -- certainly Mr. Filarsky didn't have any reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Delia was lying or was being dishonest."
2011.10-1018,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.422,2695.765,"Mr. McGill, back to immunity."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2730.784,2733.315,"Well, I -- I think that that's right."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2754.805,2758.88,But the Court's cases are a mix of history and -- and policy.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2766.473,2767.471,Right.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.471,2779.84,"And -- and the rule about malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that applied not just to -- not just private lawyers but to government lawyers as well, didn't it?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2779.84,2780.826,It did.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.199,2801.755,"So if we are going to be historically faithful, we should deny any qualified immunity to government lawyers, or expand the government immunity to -- for government lawyers, so they can do anything so long as it's not malicious?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2801.755,2803.768,"Well, that -- that's what this Court would have to do."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.768,2804.205,"Yeah, right."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2804.205,2807.329,It would have to basically expand what a common law defense.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.329,2807.61,Right.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2809.372,2817.011,"Well, it would result in this Court having to expand that immunity that it expanded in Harlow to private individuals."
2011.10-1018,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.68,2842.143,"What about -- what about the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses would be the government employees?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2864.07,2869.58,"--Well, there probably would be some distraction."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.567,2916.609,"What if Filarsky was there, you know, hired to help the fire department with these -- and he did absolutely nothing?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2930.901,2932.526,"Well, I don't think he would be liable."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.68,2937.148,Really?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2944.302,2946.158,--No.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2968.761,2974.103,"This for profits, I -- the significance of that eludes me."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,2985.614,2998.514,"--If he were purely a volunteer it -- it very well might be a different answer, because some of those policy concerns that -- that Richardson talked about and discussed may not be present."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3002.948,3007.26,"And, well -- and what if he gives the city a discount?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3015.554,3018.268,I don't know that 50 percent makes a difference.
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3051.321,3066.486,"Suppose a municipality were to -- or a State were to abolish all civil service rules and all the special rules and go back to employment at will for government employees, would that -- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity regime?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3066.486,3070.374,I don't think that it would.
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3101.894,3110.094,"It seems strange, because the immunities -- at least some of the immunities -- long predate the establishment -- the institution of the civil service system."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3119.575,3130.695,"I think that that's correct, but when you have a civil service system, a merit system, it's not as easy to correct behavior as it would be for, say, a private person."
2011.10-1018,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3146.671,3148.641,--That's not true of most lawyers.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3148.641,3149.655,Pardon me?
2011.10-1018,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3149.655,3155.138,Most lawyers are not part of the civil service -- internal lawyers are not part of the civil service system.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3160.542,3163.729,I'm -- I'm not familiar with whether--
2011.10-1018,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3163.729,3168.537,"That they're policymakers, and as such, are not subject to civil service protections."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3168.537,3178.768,"--Well, I -- I know that some subsections of lawyers within a government can be represented, so they -- they very well may have some protection."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3183.393,3191.2,"Well, the political appointees within the United States Department of Justice are not protected by civil service, so should they lack immunity?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3191.2,3195.201,"No, because they would -- they would get it under Harlow."
2011.10-1018,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3199.728,3201.105,"They are subject to market forces, aren't they?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3201.105,3204.135,They -- they very well may be.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.693,3220.361,"What if I told you that all the lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as being employed at will, and that all of them can be fired?"
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3227.154,3236.528,I think that the answer would be the same; in that they very well may not need qualified immunity because those pressures and those concerns underlying immunity aren't there.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3236.528,3240.416,Wow.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3244.397,3252.972,"I just want to go back and talk about the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because the Court had some concerns about it and I share those same concerns."
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.615,3338.219,Are all of these -- are all of these objections applicable as well to the determination of whether there was State action from the attorneys' conduct?
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3338.219,3343.702,--The -- the concerns about there being a factual inquiry?
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3343.702,3344.154,Yes.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3344.154,3348.717,I don't think so.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.994,3401.851,"But your -- your objection is not that he was investigating workplace misconduct, your objection was that he was ordering people to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his house."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3401.851,3404.835,Correct.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3408.754,3414.814,"Yes, but telling people basically either execute a search or in effect executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental function."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3414.814,3428.465,"Executing a -- a formal search by the government is something -- that's a role that the government performs, but I wouldn't say that -- I wouldn't equate, you know, executing a search with what occurred here."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.073,3433.773,You don't want to say that.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3433.773,3439.724,"--Mr. Filarsky, the function, the role that he was performing was that of an internal affairs investigator."
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.724,3446.63,"Yes, but if -- if he did the same thing for a private company -- he could do the same thing for a private company."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3461.53,3462.263,It could have.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3462.263,3463.121,Yes.
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3463.121,3463.854,It very well could have.
2011.10-1018,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3470.008,3473.618,"Well, there's very little that is uniquely governmental."
2011.10-1018,3,36275,michael_a_mcgill,,3483.879,3485.973,Thank you.
2011.10-1018,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.973,3487.33,"Thank you, counsel."
