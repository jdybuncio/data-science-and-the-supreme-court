1984.84-5059,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.525,We'll hear arguments next in Ramirez against Indiana.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,78.051,81.594,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.632,173.876,"Mr. Ripple, in that connection, where is your client now?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,173.876,180.949,My client at the present time is in Westphil Correctional Institution in Indiana.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,180.949,185.222,So he has not been returned to Michigan to continue his sentence there.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,185.222,186.271,"No, Your Honor, he has not."
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,193.507,201.352,"In that connection, let me ask you, is Michigan unsympathetic to Indiana's position here?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,203.345,210.128,"--Michigan... if I may give you these facts first, I think they will partially--"
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.128,211.039,I know what the facts are.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,211.039,212.111,--answer your... answer your--
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,212.111,212.86,I know what the facts are.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,212.86,227.471,"--Well, Michigan could... Michigan's Governor had a right to make a determination in this case before he sent the petitioner across the line to stand charges, to stand trial on the Diazepam charges."
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.3,232.053,"But Michigan isn't complaining here, is it?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,232.053,234.254,--Michigan is not complaining here.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.321,247.743,Why should they complain?
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,247.743,252.336,They should complain because the Interstate Agreement in fact was violated.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,252.336,257.889,"But Indiana has the obligation and the expense of taking care of your client, not Michigan."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,257.889,258.68,That's correct.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,258.68,259.281,They got rid of him.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,259.281,270.107,But Michigan and the other states of the Union must in fact live with the uncertainty of knowing that Indiana will not abide by this agreement as it was set up.
1984.84-5059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.582,278.072,You think I don't know them.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,278.072,282.997,"--I am not sure, sir, but I believe it's my obligation to formally inform the Court of--"
1984.84-5059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.997,283.625,You say they are facts not of record?
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,283.625,291.062,"--They are subsequent to trial, but I think pertinent to the disposition of the case, and I think, therefore, I have an obligation to inform the Court of them."
1984.84-5059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.989,705.825,"Mr. Ripple, what if he hadn't agreed voluntarily to leave Michigan?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,712.689,732.701,"Under Article 4 of the Interstate Agreement, Mr. Justice White, he had the right to request a hearing under the Uniform Extradition Act, and he also had a right to request that the Governor of Michigan not honor the extradition request, which--"
1984.84-5059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.701,740.186,"Well, nevertheless, he could have been... if these procedures... if they'd gone through the right procedures, he could have been extradited--"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,740.186,742.727,--If they had gone through the correct procedures.
1984.84-5059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.727,743.288,--All right.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,761.881,766.583,On the Diazepam charges?
1984.84-5059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.319,817.967,"Mr. Ripple, assuming there's a violation of the requirements of the IAD, I think the more difficult question is what's the remedy, because the IAD is silent on what you do about it."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,853.591,855.121,--No.
1984.84-5059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.012,917.393,Or you might say they did their work against the Ker and Frisbie cases in that case.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,917.393,942.689,"I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that an entire reading of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, especially Article I, indicates that they were aware of Ker and Frisbie and in fact were trying to establish a system substantially different from Ker and Frisbie that would bring a certain amount of certainty and comity to an area which otherwise would not be governed by Ker and Frisbie."
1984.84-5059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.689,946.693,"Well, but there is a certain amount of waste motion involved here if we sustain your claim."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,969.055,970.628,I think there are two points that need to be made on this.
1984.84-5059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.935,1058.855,May I interrupt before you do?
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1070.754,1081.402,"--We have, Mr. Justice, in this case because it has gone on for so long and because the facts of the situation have changed, we have a rather unusual circumstance."
1984.84-5059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.113,1145.793,"Well, do you mean so that he couldn't ever be tried?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1145.793,1148.405,"Yes, Your Honor, in this particular case."
1984.84-5059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1148.405,1156.54,"Well, it's just hard to understand why you think that should occur."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1164.206,1170.14,We submit that that is at least the minimum that ought to occur.
1984.84-5059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1183.687,1191.153,"These are very serious charges, and I just wondered what in the world would justify a dismissal with prejudice."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1191.153,1203.78,"--Well, it may very well be impossible for the man to get a fair trial at this point, to defend himself at this point, among other points, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1250.483,1262.361,"Mr. Ripple, will you spell out for me wherein your client has suffered prejudice other than not having a formalistic procedure to follow?"
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1297.295,1312.136,He was also prejudiced by being charged... by being tried by a court which did not have authority to enter a judgment of conviction against him and give him a consecutive sentence with respect to the charge.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1373.014,1382.27,"Well, this is a little different from World-Wide Volkswagen in the sense that you can see that Indiana had some jurisdiction over him, for the lesser charge in any event."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1382.27,1384.593,It had jurisdiction over him for the lesser charge.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1384.593,1386.344,So you're giving them partial jurisdiction.
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1386.344,1387.315,That's correct.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1416.564,1418.004,What is the factual answer to all this?
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1423.617,1430.753,We make no claim that there was purposeful deception by the State of Indiana ab initio.
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1609.52,1612.722,"Well, of course, Michigan isn't here with an amicus brief either."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1612.722,1618.719,"They are not, and I don't think you would expect, Mr. Justice, that they would be here in support of the criminal--"
1984.84-5059,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1618.719,1619.958,"Well, on your basis I would expect them to be here."
1984.84-5059,0,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,1619.958,1623.191,"--Well, we would respectfully, I think, disagree on that point."
1984.84-5059,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.055,1637.069,Mr. Daily.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1637.069,1640.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.067,1648.187,Thank you very much for--
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1651.778,1667.23,"--Michigan, in answer to another question, promptly paroled the defendant in this case after his conviction in Indiana, I presume so as not to have to pay for his upkeep during his incarceration."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.975,1893.278,"Counsel, they didn't say it wasn't a detainer, but they did that its presence on the 424 charges was obtained outside the agreement."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1894.279,1902.453,"And Indiana acknowledges that there has been a violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, but it is not the failure to file a detainer in 424."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.453,1904.166,I see.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1904.166,1906.507,It is putting incorrect information on the detainer.
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.432,1915.764,What was the violation by Indiana?
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1915.764,1934.737,"Indiana's violation, although it doesn't specifically require the receiving state to be notified of the exact nature of the charge against him, I think it could be held to be a violation of the agreement to incorrectly notify the holding state as to the nature of the charge."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.333,1947.794,But you do acknowledge there was a violation by Indiana.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,1947.794,1949.985,"Yes, Your Honor, we do, clearly."
1984.84-5059,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2056.134,2058.838,"Counsel, I'm confused about one thing."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2069.374,2080.14,"--One of the benefits that petitioner has in this case and that prisoners have under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is that they can, unless the court indicates otherwise, serve these sentences concurrently."
1984.84-5059,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2097.711,2099.123,Where would he serve them?
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2099.123,2101.615,Ordinarily he would be returned to the sending state.
1984.84-5059,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2105.856,2110.35,"That's the way I thought you read the statute, and yet that didn't happen in this case."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2110.35,2117.434,"Because immediately after sentencing in Indiana, the Michigan authorities paroled him, said we don't want him back, in effect."
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.434,2129.862,"Well, I assume the Indiana judge could have sentenced him to a consecutive sentence, in which case he would have gone back to Michigan to fill that term and come back to Indiana, right?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2129.862,2130.653,That's true.
1984.84-5059,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.627,2157.412,"I take it that when Michigan decided to parole him, they were aware that he was up on another drug charge."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2157.412,2166.025,The Michigan authorities were well aware that he had been convicted and sentenced in Indiana at the time of the parole hearing in Michigan.
1984.84-5059,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.025,2170.299,It seems rather extraordinary.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2170.299,2171.419,That he would be paroled?
1984.84-5059,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.419,2172.38,Yes.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2172.38,2177.754,"If he were not paroled, he would be still maintained at the expense of Michigan in Michigan prisons."
1984.84-5059,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.754,2179.714,That's my next question.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2183.978,2196.387,"I have no way of being sure of the thought processes behind the Michigan parole authority's decision, but I very much assume that their prison system is as crowded as ours, and they were very happy to turn him over to Indiana for custody."
1984.84-5059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2196.387,2210.666,"--Well, it seems like there's a certain accounting approach to bringing someone back to Indiana, trying them for an offense, and then sentencing them to a concurrent sentence to one which they're already serving in Michigan."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2212.145,2226.217,"That's certainly one of the reasons for the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, so that prisoners can get rid of pending charges, and unless they are sentenced to consecutive sentences, they can serve them out concurrently rather than consecutively."
1984.84-5059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.231,2237.584,"--Well, was the sentence imposed by the Indiana court here consecutive?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2237.584,2238.734,"No, it was not."
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.225,2261.629,There's a lot easier way of clearing the books than getting the fellow back and trying him and sentencing to a concurrent.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2270.565,2274.086,"Well, in this case it turned out it be... it turned out to be more than the Michigan sentence."
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2352.909,2373.953,"Well, is there no claim at all on the part of the defendant, that I thought was being asserted, to have his right to argue in Michigan the appropriateness of the disposition of Michigan to send him off in response to the detainer?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2373.953,2381.237,"--No, because the petitioner in this case is asserting a different violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers."
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2393.285,2414.409,"Well, it seems to me it's related that there is no jurisdiction until there's a proper extradition, and there wasn't a proper extradition on these charges, and that the defendant has some right to a proper extradition proceeding under the IAD."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2417.271,2428.587,"That may be true, but then the remedy in that case is perhaps the civil remedy that... the petitioner here is pursuing a civil remedy through the U.S. district court for the Southern District of Indiana."
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.996,2441.71,You mean there's a 1983 action ahead--
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2441.71,2442.799,"--Yes, Your Honor, there's a 1983--"
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2442.799,2443.77,--against Indiana?
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2443.77,2445.431,--There's a 1983 action.
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2461.071,2468.457,What would happen if we were to agree that dismissal is appropriate but without prejudice?
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2471.888,2476.343,Presumably the defendant would be retried.
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2485.83,2493.091,"I suppose because Michigan has already paroled him, he would not have to be sent back to Michigan."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2495.593,2497.536,I don't know that we can send him back to Michigan.
1984.84-5059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2500.798,2501.169,Yes.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2502.648,2511.764,The petitioner asserts that by adopting this agreement the state has somehow waived its right to bring prisoners into a state illegally.
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.189,2611.252,But the submission is that he was brought to trial by a court that didn't have any jurisdiction to bring him to trial.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2611.252,2619.139,"--There's nothing, I submit, in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers which says the receiving... the court in Indiana has no jurisdiction."
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.578,2639.92,So you just think that the way to decide this case is just follow Frisbie.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2639.92,2641.322,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.322,2648.906,And that Indiana's violation will just have to be left to history to cure.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2648.906,2651.29,Or the civil action pending in the district court.
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.29,2656.262,But there's just no remedy otherwise.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2656.262,2659.024,"Well, the remedy lies in the civil action."
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.024,2660.777,"Well, what do you do?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2668.711,2670.401,I don't suggest that.
1984.84-5059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.063,2675.864,What does the 1983 case... what does it allege?
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2675.864,2677.126,"--It's a strange case, Your Honor."
1984.84-5059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.043,2721.996,"Well, we don't generally get oral argument on petitions for--"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2721.996,2723.265,"Well, I get all excited about that one."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2726.097,2733.303,"--Yes, but if your view of that case is correct, you're in effect saying there isn't any real remedy unless you find a remedy in this case."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2733.303,2733.873,--No.
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.936,2741.207,But what... I'm a little puzzled about what it would be.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2744.159,2748.544,"Well, I think the remedy here may be the same as the remedy in Frisbie v. Collins."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.544,2750.624,"But there's nothing, isn't it?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2750.624,2754.767,Is there... that's not discussed in Frisbie v. Collins.
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.127,2764.682,"But the only damage to this person that he's been convicted, and yet you're saying the conviction is valid."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2768.876,2770.947,"Well, if this Court wants to--"
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.947,2772.737,I just--
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2772.737,2778.183,"--I understand that, Your Honor, and it's a concern here with me, too; that a wrong has been committed for which there may not be a remedy."
1984.84-5059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.646,2796.342,"--Well, I understand that, but arguably isn't there a difference that here if you have... perhaps one could read the Interstate Agreement on Detainers to be a surrender by each of the contracting states of some element of jurisdiction it would otherwise possess."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2803.427,2809.752,"--That... and I think that is the heart of the petitioner's argument, that there has been some surrender of a right here to try the defendant."
1984.84-5059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2821.851,2829.117,"Even if there were such a surrender, perhaps the only person... the only party you could claim violation of would be the state of Michigan."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2829.117,2829.274,--That was--
1984.84-5059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.274,2830.246,--rather than the defendant.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2830.246,2830.676,--Yes.
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.96,2876.306,"But the detainer statute says specifically who shall have jurisdiction, in quotes, jurisdiction in the kidnapping statute, doesn't it?"
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2876.306,2877.206,--That's true.
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.537,2879.837,"Well, that's the only point we've been arguing here."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2879.837,2883.38,"--Well, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers says that jurisdiction is in Michigan."
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.364,2889.014,For all other purposes.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2891.345,2898.74,"--But if read with the following sentence, I think it indicates a different intent on the part of the parties to the agreement."
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2898.74,2909.066,"""The prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state. """
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2912.779,2917.534,"That's (g), I'm sorry."
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.615,2935.797,But it says--
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2935.797,2937.987,"--Well, it certainly doesn't say that Indiana doesn't have jurisdiction."
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2950.674,2954.057,"--Well, your argument is that Michigan should raise this."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2954.057,2955.048,Certainly.
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.048,2962.361,"Well, it seems to me that anybody has a right to be tried by a court of competent jurisdiction."
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2962.361,2971.457,"Well, I guess the question then is whether the Indiana court has jurisdiction, and I maintain that it does."
1984.84-5059,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.457,2973.49,And the other side says no.
1984.84-5059,1,44519,william_earl_daily,,2973.49,2975.421,"That's correct, and that's why we're here."
1984.84-5059,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.578,3248.969,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Ripple?"
1984.84-5059,2,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,3248.969,3250.661,"Please, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.611,3285.527,"Mr. Ripple, what would really be the purpose of setting aside, having this conviction set aside?"
1984.84-5059,2,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,3295.411,3310.401,"--I think he would at least have the opportunity to be tried by a court which had jurisdiction, and that might be very important to him if Indiana elects not to try him in light of the habitual statute in Indiana should he ever be in trouble with the law again."
1984.84-5059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.956,3322.35,"There are other ways of doing that besides setting aside the criminal conviction, I suppose."
1984.84-5059,2,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,3322.35,3328.473,"--And you could permit new trial, and Indiana would have to bear that responsibility."
1984.84-5059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.473,3338.12,"The Indiana officials who made the mistakes, or the Michigan people who made the mistakes could be fired or they could be... they will learn what their duties are."
1984.84-5059,2,33964,kenneth_francis_ripple,,3339.74,3349.817,"Although we submit that's impossible in the context of this case, that indeed a 1983 remedy would not be... it would not make the petitioner whole."
1984.84-5059,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.939,3394.67,"Thank you, gentlemen."
