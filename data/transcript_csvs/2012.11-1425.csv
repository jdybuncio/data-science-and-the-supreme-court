2012.11-1425,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.52,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case Number 11-1425, Missouri v. McNeely."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,10.639,11.622,Thank you.
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,25.798,33.154,How come it took so long for this State to figure out that it needed to do this without a warrant?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,33.154,33.971,--Well--
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,33.971,38.541,The officer testified that he's been making drunk driving arrests for years--
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,38.541,39.425,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,39.425,43.76,--and I think in only one circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,52.633,61.239,"Well, Your Honor, back in 2003, there was an appellate court case from Missouri that dealt with the importance of the words--"
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.239,67.458,"No, I understand why he decided to do it, to forego getting a warrant."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,72.179,81.385,"--Your Honor, that -- that ignores the fact that had he sought a warrant -- there's no question that he would have been able to secure a warrant."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.689,89.308,But it took a considerable amount of time for all the years he did it.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,89.308,91.51,"That's true, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,91.51,98.68,And -- and he didn't testify to it causing a loss of any particular case.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,98.68,104.75,"But in this particular case, it was going to take 90 minutes to 2 hours to secure the warrant."
2012.11-1425,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.887,121.712,"But he said -- he said in the ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I encountered no difficulty getting a warrant in prior cases."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,127.349,136.889,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, he never had a problem securing a warrant, but there was a delay; and that's -- that's the difference."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.029,155.6,What constitutional right exists for a State to get the best evidence?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,155.6,164.539,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think that that is something that we should always strive for, to be able to get the best possible evidence in the case."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.539,165.006,"No, no, no."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,178.632,184.869,The -- the touchstone of any Fourth Amendment analysis is the reasonableness of the search.
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.387,198.362,So how can it be reasonable to forego the Fourth Amendment in a procedure as intrusive as a needle going into someone's body?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,236.737,239.939,"--And, Justice Sotomayor, I would disagree with that."
2012.11-1425,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.62,268.439,"Why don't you force him to take the breathalyzer test, instead of forcing him to have a needle shoved in his -- in his arm?"
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,268.439,269.541,For practical--
2012.11-1425,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.541,280.949,What is the difference between the reliability or the acceptability by juries of a breathalyzer test as opposed to a blood draw?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,280.949,284.635,"--Justice Scalia, both tests are very reliable."
2012.11-1425,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.856,326.395,"If we are talking about reasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to look to the rules and practices of other States?"
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,326.395,336.451,"Justice Kennedy, as the Respondent points out, there are 25 states that would be opposed to -- to the warrantless blood draw at issue in this case."
2012.11-1425,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.174,365.353,"But the fact that those States do have a warrant requirement and from what we can best tell make it work very well, including some expedited procedures where you can get warrants within minutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20 minutes to get just to the hospital or the police station anyway."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,380.697,382.499,"--I don't believe it does, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1425,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.606,395.089,But we have always -- correct me if I'm wrong.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,412.634,418.072,"Your Honor, I think this Court's decision in Sampson vs. California is instructive."
2012.11-1425,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.266,436.449,Of course we don't know why they disapproved.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,445.824,449.376,"I suppose that is a possibility, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1425,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.376,460.232,Is there any showing that conviction rate in those States is lower than in the States where the practice is to take the test without the warrant?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,460.232,465.219,"Your Honor, I think amici National District Attorneys Association cited a study."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,487.318,499.726,So the new rule is we have to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to be suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best evidence to make its case out?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,499.726,502.261,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1425,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.081,512.116,Probable cause is not enough.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,532.863,535.982,"--You are absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg, probable cause is not enough."
2012.11-1425,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,546.857,559.914,"Mr. Koester, suppose that, instead of waiting 2 hours, there were procedures in place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances within 15 or 20 minutes."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,567.186,576.976,"--I think if a particular jurisdiction had perfected the warrant process to the point where they could routinely obtain search warrants in 15 minutes, I think we would have a different outcome."
2012.11-1425,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,586.165,587.517,So why can't you do that?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,638.116,645.87,"Justice Breyer, I think in practical application it is going to be more of a time-consuming process, though, to obtain the search--"
2012.11-1425,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.87,648.388,"Why wouldn't it take -- let's see, how long did it take me to say that?"
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,654.809,655.911,--To obtain a search warrant--
2012.11-1425,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.911,659.696,"Well, what you do is you have a system, and you phone up and you do just what I said."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,677.741,685.18,"--Well, Justice Breyer, that's why I drew the analogy between the telephonic search warrants that were approved back in the 1970s."
2012.11-1425,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.738,706.344,"Mr. Koester, in most jurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat cannot apply for and get a search warrant."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,721.77,723.036,--That is absolutely correct.
2012.11-1425,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.036,723.605,Is that the case in Missouri?
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,723.605,724.872,That is the case in Missouri.
2012.11-1425,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,726.174,732.078,In some cases I suppose the judges actually want to read the affidavit and give it some thought.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,733.361,735.546,"--That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1425,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.6,748.504,"But we do have -- we do have, I think, an indication that there are jurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,748.504,753.107,"--That may be true, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,753.107,753.741,So do you define reasonableness--
2012.11-1425,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,753.741,757.126,You suggest that 15 or 20 would be a different case.
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,759.661,768.601,"That's a difficult question, to draw a bright line for exactly when we would draw the line where -- where the exigency would disappear."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.601,784.777,"--So would the importance of the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional right, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by the people who are the least efficient or by the people who are the most reasonably efficient?"
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,784.777,785.979,"Well, Justice Sotomayor--"
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.979,789.665,"Meaning people, police jurisdictions."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,789.665,796.334,"--Of course, local law enforcement practices are going to vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction."
2012.11-1425,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,796.334,808.559,"Absolutely, but should they -- should we permit them to vary in terms of inefficiency or should we be encouraging them to vary within a reasonable range?"
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,808.559,815.148,"Well, I think prosecutors are always going to strive to obtain search warrants as efficiently as possible."
2012.11-1425,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,824.504,829.323,"Members of the Court have intruded on your rebuttal time, including me, so we will give you a little extra."
2012.11-1425,0,31302,john_n_koester_jr,,829.323,829.758,Thank you.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,841.882,846.851,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.585,881.007,"But I mean, once we say that you don't need a warrant, you know, even if things improve, the game's up, right?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,881.707,883.959,"No, I don't think that that's true at all."
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.992,893.515,"You mean somebody can come up 10 years from now and say, although you approved it 10 years ago without a warrant, things have changed, so now you need a warrant?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,893.515,906.658,"--I think that if the world changed so that every police officer had an iPad and that judges were always on duty and that the warrants could be gotten that quickly, you would consider that and you would also consider the other sources of delay, which are the time to get to the hospital, etcetera, etcetera."
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.925,912.146,"But if that's the case, then why shouldn't that determination be made case by case?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,912.146,913.762,--Because--
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.762,918.132,"Case by case, whether in fact it would have taken that long to get a warrant?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,925.203,926.019,--The question--
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.019,927.921,"Totality of the circumstances test, right?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,927.921,932.892,"--Right, but the totality of the circumstances are with respect to the destruction of evidence and what the police are witnessing."
2012.11-1425,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.148,966.963,"Ms. Saharsky, what about saying at least they should try, since a number of jurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say, initiate the process while you are going to the hospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at least there has been an effort to get a warrant."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,966.963,969.565,--I think there are legal problems with that and practical problems with that.
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.319,982.64,"Well, we have -- I don't want to, because you have multiple answers -- but on that point, we do talk about exigent circumstances."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,994.966,995.916,Right.
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1006.538,1007.64,But Justice Ginsburg said 30 minutes.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1007.64,1009.892,--Right.
2012.11-1425,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1028.271,1031.473,"Jurisdictions have an incentive to get a warrant, I would think."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1082.755,1084.373,"--Well, I mean, a couple of responses."
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.445,1125.85,I thought -- I thought that we often said that you look at whether or not you can get a warrant before you can break in so that the drugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1127.969,1128.352,--Right.
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.352,1131.338,"And if that showing is not made, you must get a warrant."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1131.338,1131.804,But the Court--
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.804,1137.175,So I think it's quite incorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time factor.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1137.175,1138.958,--I think it matters as a general--
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1138.958,1139.527,We look at it all the time.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1139.527,1144.062,--I think it matters as a general matter whether warrants take time to get and whether evidence is lost.
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.689,1161.773,I agree that there is a uniform standard.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1175.95,1183.454,"Well, if I am understanding it correctly, I think our point is this, which is that the police officers have to act reasonably in the situation."
2012.11-1425,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.208,1193.412,"But there are so many situations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1238.641,1240.493,"--I mean, with respect, we disagree."
2012.11-1425,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.05,1256.669,You mentioned Schmerber.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1288.223,1293.277,"--The Court made a mention of 2 hours, but that was not a critical portion of its analysis."
2012.11-1425,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.348,1302.466,What was all the -- why was it in the opinion?
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1302.466,1304.116,"--Well, it's one line in the opinion."
2012.11-1425,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.726,1317.343,Yes.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1318.476,1320.678,"--Well, they said particularly it means there's an extra thing."
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.581,1326.581,"That doesn't mean that it was enough, either, right?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1326.581,1334.002,"--Well, that gives me the second part of my answer, which is the Court's cases since Schmerber have relied on the destruction of this evidence being enough for exigency."
2012.11-1425,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.06,1362.922,"Counsel for Missouri tells us, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good and that in fact he expects that the consequence of our ruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken drivers will agree to the breathalyzer test."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1393.024,1405.765,"--Well, because in that situation, I think they're willing to take their chances that the evidence is going to dissipate below the.08 standard or below these higher enhanced penalties,.15, and then be able to challenge it, as opposed to if they gave the evidence that they potentially wouldn't be able to challenge it."
2012.11-1425,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1407.099,1408.35,Or maybe they're drunk.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1434.934,1436.618,"--Well, I think there are two answers."
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.716,1460.149,"Now, I think you should be fair."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1466.322,1471.291,"--Well, even in some of the telephonic -- telephonic warrant procedures, you still have to have a written document."
2012.11-1425,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1496.341,1500.56,So is it okay -- is it okay to let police officers take the blood?
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1500.56,1504.095,"--Well, we think that's a different question and one that the Court reserved in Schmerber."
2012.11-1425,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1524.092,1525.944,"Oh, I bet that if we rule in your favor, we will."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1525.944,1527.411,I'm not sure that that's true.
2012.11-1425,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1549.309,1559.682,Do you want to be in those rural places and be stopped without an independent magistrate approving a field officer taking blood from you?
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1559.682,1568.188,"--Well, what I'm saying is that there are only a few States that are doing it now, and I think it is -- it should be -- the Court should wait until it actually has a record to make that determination."
2012.11-1425,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1584.197,1591.303,"Going back to Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless blood test?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1591.303,1592.736,--Yes.
2012.11-1425,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1659.964,1670.338,"All this talk about, you know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose the exact same thing could be said in other alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage drinking."
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1673.84,1674.707,No.
2012.11-1425,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1691.501,1698.189,So it's not just exigency that you're -- you're saying that there should be a weighing of the costs and benefits here.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1698.189,1698.522,Yes.
2012.11-1425,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.891,1735.628,"Incidentally, it wasn't clear to me: Is that 1 hour from the time of the -- pardon me -- 2 hours from the time of the stop or 2 hours from the time he put him in the back of the patrol car?"
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1736.495,1738.514,"--It's not entirely clear, but I think it's 2 hours total."
2012.11-1425,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.753,1747.736,You can finish your thought.
2012.11-1425,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1747.736,1756.876,"--There's one other piece of data, which is a NHTSA study that's referred to in the briefs, about where the court -- where folks in four States where warrants were required tried to get them quickly as possible."
2012.11-1425,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.864,1765.414,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1771.551,1773.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.782,1795.267,I thought the question was if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a breathalyzer.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1795.267,1798.638,The question is -- it's not clear to me.
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.808,1808.66,Was your client was offered the breathalyzer twice?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1808.66,1810.712,"--This client was offered the breathalyzer, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.712,1811.312,How many times?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1811.312,1813.245,"And declined it twice, that's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.655,1849.903,"I mean, aside from all -- the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind, is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less likely that people who are really innocent in fact have this happen to them and so forth."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1876.138,1876.538,--Right.
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1876.538,1883.974,"So at some point, I would wish you would spend some time addressing that, that practical argument."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1883.974,1885.76,"I'd be happy to answer that question right now, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.244,1914.013,Is this a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1990.161,1992.613,"--Your Honor, I do not know the answer to that."
2012.11-1425,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.613,1993.629,I bet you they're not.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1993.629,2003.985,"But I think it's also true, Your Honor, that warrants in general are never turned down, that the overwhelming percentage of warrant requests in all criminal cases are granted -- are granted by magistrates."
2012.11-1425,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.985,2011.84,"But in many of them there is a lot of judgment that has to be brought to bear: Is this a reliable informant, how long ago did he tell you, and so forth."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2028.036,2042.796,"This Court's entire Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, Your Honor, rests on the proposition that the privacy safeguards of the Fourth Amendment benefit by having a neutral and detached magistrate review the evidence before the State does something as intrusive as putting a needle in somebody's arm."
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.046,2048.363,What if the State has a form; we have forms in the Joint Appendix.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2068.094,2071.546,"--Well, it's something very close to what Missouri already has, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.362,2124.414,What about that field sobriety test?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2149.898,2155.052,--Do you mean do you need a warrant to have the field sobriety test?
2012.11-1425,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2155.052,2155.452,Yes.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2155.452,2157.369,"Is that the question, Justice Ginsburg?"
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2177.348,2179.6,"What about a breathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2179.6,2185.938,"--I think you probably do need a warrant for a breathalyzer, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2196.462,2200.764,"I know what Missouri's position is, and I know it's not a breathalyzer test."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2207.852,2229.6,"I think, Your Honor, it -- I would say that requiring somebody to produce, to breathe into a machine for -- in order to gather evidence for the State's prosecution is a state -- is a search that should probably trigger the warrant requirement, but it is certainly a less -- it is certainly less intrusive, Your Honor, it is certainly less intrusive than -- than the blood test--"
2012.11-1425,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.6,2232.402,"It bears considerably on the reasonableness, doesn't it?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2235.921,2238.306,"--Well, I certainly don't want to bite -- I want to bite off--"
2012.11-1425,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.306,2244.793,It's a different case and what is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is not necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a balloon.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2244.793,2255.065,"--Your Honor, I certainly want to bite off as little as I have to chew in this case, but there are two salient facts because I think it is important to focus on what is before the Court in this case."
2012.11-1425,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2292.173,2303.315,"Mr. Shapiro, could you tell me, and what I am deeply troubled about in your argument, is you incant the totality of the circumstances test."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2351.162,2352.831,"Yes, so that's exactly correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2368.008,2378.296,Suppose you are in a rural jurisdiction and it takes a long time to rouse a prosecutor and a magistrate at 3:00 in the morning to get the warrant.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2386.485,2390.521,"Well, Your Honor, Cape Girardeau County is a rural county in southeastern Missouri--"
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2390.521,2392.806,But I'm asking you a hypothetical question.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2417.438,2419.19,"--I would say no, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.26,2428.462,Suppose the magistrate is unavailable because he or she is ill?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2428.462,2430.748,"--Then I think that's a different situation, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2431.181,2436.085,Would you agree that that's an exigent circumstance which would allow a warrantless blood sample?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2436.085,2440.12,--I think it might well if the magistrate were unavailable and there were no alternative magistrate.
2012.11-1425,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2442.056,2443.439,"That's a separate question, isn't it?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2457.331,2458.648,"--That is correct, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1425,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2458.648,2475.043,"So one could disagree with you and one could think, as Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy suggested, you know, you do take into account that it's the middle of the night in a rural county and it's going to take two hours, but still think, well, that's the analysis you had to go through."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2475.043,2476.427,"That is correct, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.575,2556.931,A lot of States have varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict rules against drunk driving.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2641.551,2644.137,"--Well, I would say several things."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2689.082,2699.973,"My question is what you don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think of a second-best solution it might always be better than what I think of as a second-best solution."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2699.973,2702.591,"--I have enormous confidence in you, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.591,2713.883,I -- I want to know if you want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a number of them floating around -- and I just wonder if you want to express any view on a second-best solution.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2713.883,2732.428,"Well, well -- well, our -- our position, and I'm not sure whether you're classifying this as our first position or something else -- our position is that within the context of Schmerber, if there are special facts external to the warrant requirement, then you have to apply a totality of the circumstances test, and you ought to apply a reasonableness standard."
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2767.501,2776.224,"That's not true, because there's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a search with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search in terms of suppression; isn't that correct?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2776.224,2786.847,"--Well, there is some advantage to having -- certainly, a search that is conducted pursuant to a warrant is much less subject to suppression than a search that is subject not pursuant to a warrant."
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2804.393,2805.209,Can I ask you this question?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2833.576,2839.047,--I don't -- excuse me -- I don't think the Fourth Amendment rule turns on the amount of blood that you take out of somebody's body.
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.072,2856.676,"So does that mean -- the last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks about some other methods, including a urine sample."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2876.739,2878.191,"--This Court has said that, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2878.191,2878.857,Yes.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2878.857,2884.278,"--in a variety of circumstances with drug testing cases, where they weren't even law enforcement cases, they were special needs cases."
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.978,2902.806,"What about -- what about this device that you just sort of hold in front of it, you don't have to blow up the balloon, you just hold it in front of the individual and it measures to some extent blood alcohol content, or at least whether the individual's been drinking?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2905.174,2908.626,"--I think that -- I think that's probably -- I think that's probably correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2963.944,2974.485,You're in an odd -- odd position to be making -- it's an understandable position -- your argument is these warrants are just easy as -- as pie.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2996.998,3005.035,"--But I don't think it's unreasonable, Your Honor, and it's because we all recognize that the evidence in these cases is relatively routinized, and the procedures are relatively standardized."
2012.11-1425,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3013.091,3028.533,"Mr. Shapiro, could you go back to what in this conversation we sort of have lost focus of, which is the question presented, and which is the essence, I think, of your adversary's arguments."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3072.746,3078.133,"--I'd be happy to answer that question, Justice Sotomayor, if I could just complete my answer to the Chief Justice for one second."
2012.11-1425,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.133,3078.933,Sure.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3078.933,3092.876,"And my answer would be that even if there are boxes on a standardized form, there is value to making sure that the prosecutor and the police have checked off all the right boxes before they engage in a process as intrusive as putting a needle in somebody's arm."
2012.11-1425,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3126.031,3137.855,"Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an odd case, because Justice Ginsburg are exactly right, that they spend a lot of time talking about special facts, and particularly so, but then you read the opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't find the special facts."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3137.855,3155.466,"--I think the special facts, Your Honor, were the accident and the injuries at the scene, which delayed the police for 2 hours before they could even get to the hospital and initiate the process of applying for a warrant, at a time when there were no cell phones, there were no faxes, there were no internets, and all warrant applications had to be presented in person."
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3156.902,3159.954,"Well, if they had sent more police officers to the scene, they could have done everything faster."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3159.954,3160.92,Excuse me?
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3160.92,3166.591,"If they had sent more police officers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then they could have done it faster."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3166.591,3166.991,Perhaps.
2012.11-1425,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3166.991,3174.114,So what's the difference between that practical limitation and the limitation that exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction?
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3174.114,3185.836,"Well, I think that practical limitation, whether or not there were other officers on the scene, right, or that could have been sent to the scene, we're not asking for a rule in which this Court would direct police officers how they -- they ought to deploy their resources."
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.658,3246.293,"Well, I'm sorry, what's the relevance of that?"
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3246.293,3257.434,"The relevance of that is that it is not true that in every -- it won't be true in every case, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State is losing evidence with each passing moment."
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3257.434,3268.841,"But it depends upon when the last -- if a person left the restaurant right after they had a nightcap and then left, but if they just had drinks before, I mean, the problem seems to be there in either case."
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3268.841,3269.625,Well--
2012.11-1425,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3269.625,3271.86,You don't know when the person's last drink was.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3271.86,3275.145,"--Well, you may or may not know, depending on what the -- the person is willing to tell you."
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.351,3291.088,I am probably just -- but a policeman has probable cause to believe that somebody inside the house has drugs.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3296.492,3296.892,Right.
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.892,3301.63,He doesn't have to get a warrant as long as he reasonably believes that the evidence is disappearing.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3308.617,3309.1,Right.
2012.11-1425,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.1,3310.217,--and say it's the same thing.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3310.217,3313.437,Because the process is a very different process.
2012.11-1425,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3340.005,3343.04,What you're saying is if it's now or never--
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3343.04,3343.79,It is now or--
2012.11-1425,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.79,3345.659,--where the other is a slow process.
2012.11-1425,2,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3345.659,3360.149,"--It is now or never and not only is it now or never, that -- but in most of those cases, probably not all, but in most of the cases, the State's case is going to disappear down the drain along with the drugs and the ability to destroy the drugs lies entirely within the control of the defendant."
2012.11-1425,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3382.598,3392.138,"Well, we -- we know the defense attorneys love it when there's a delay, because then the retrograde analysis has more and more contingencies that make it unreliable."
