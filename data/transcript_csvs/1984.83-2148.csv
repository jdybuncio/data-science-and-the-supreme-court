1984.83-2148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.638,We will hear arguments next this morning in Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife against the Klamath Indian Tribe.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,42.889,52.236,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the statement of Oregon appears before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit."
1984.83-2148,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.413,160.467,"Mr. Frohnmayer, do you agree that tribal hunting and fishing rights can exist outside of reservation lands?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,160.467,161.659,"Yes, very clearly."
1984.83-2148,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.338,176.398,"Well, is it possible that the 1864 treaty can be read to preserve the tribe's hunting and fishing rights in land that was at that time included in the reservation?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,176.398,178.228,I'm sorry.
1984.83-2148,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.971,198.604,"Well, can you read that 1864 treaty as creating hunting and fishing rights in whatever land was in the reservation at that time but not that it is forever bound to that land."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,201.565,222.917,"I don't think so, and this anticipates an argument I would make in a moment, but I will reach it now, and that is that the language of the treaty is very careful to express that the hunting and fishing... or that the fishing rights are ""within its limits"", and then when it goes on in the same sentence to confer the gathering rights given to the tribe, those are also expressed as within the limits."
1984.83-2148,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.566,242.822,Do you think the better reading of the treaty language then is to tie it irrevocably to the boundaries of the reservation?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,242.822,247.874,"--Yes, because it is a reservation... it is the creation of on reservation rights."
1984.83-2148,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.937,373.029,"Mr. Frohnmayer, is there anything to establish whether that Claims Commission considered the value of the tribal hunting and fishing rights when it made its award?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,373.029,382.224,"In the Claims Commission, counsel for both parties agreed that they should be compensated at fair market value and at the highest and best use."
1984.83-2148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.799,469.362,I am a little curious as to what that stipulation reflects.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,479.277,487.244,"The latter construction is probably correct, and of course the state was a stranger to the agreement between the United States government and the tribes."
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.999,520.076,"Does the record tell us, General Frohnmayer, whether the state required non-Indians to have licenses to hunt and fish during this period?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,520.076,534.235,"The record is silent on that point, but I am certain from everything I know about the history of enforcement of Oregon game and fish laws that seasonal limits, bag limits, and license requirements would be required uniformly of persons not of the tribe."
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.235,537.817,"So really what was happening here, they just weren't enforcing those against the Indians."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,537.817,539.437,That is apparently so.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.312,630.867,"Could I ask, Mr. Attorney General, before the 1864 treaty, the Indians had aboriginal title to a much larger area?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,630.867,632.169,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.169,636.531,And part of the treaty was ceding all but the reservation?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,636.531,637.723,That is correct.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.723,647.727,"And was there any express mention, in ceding the non-reservation lands, was there any mention of ceding fishing rights also?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,647.727,650.559,"No, the cession--"
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.559,655.013,I take it that the Indians before the treaty had fishing rights.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,655.013,656.432,"--Aboriginal fishing rights, yes."
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.432,656.713,"Yes, exactly."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,656.713,657.664,"Yes, throughout the--"
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.664,665.218,How did they lose their aboriginal fishing rights in the area that was not included in the reservation?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,665.218,667.531,"--By virtue of the treaty, Justice White."
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.531,675.046,"Just by quit claiming their right, title, and interest to all that land except the reservation?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,675.046,675.546,Yes.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.458,678.158,"It didn't mention fishing rights, though."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,678.158,679.389,--It didn't mention any rights.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.38,682.222,"Yes, all right."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,682.222,690.487,"Nor has this Court, to my knowledge, in any place when a general cession of land is made to the United States specifically required the separate itemization or valuation--"
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.487,693.709,I was just pointing... that they lost fishing rights by a general cession.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,693.709,695.58,"--That's right, for which they were paid."
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.58,708.398,"And you are arguing, I suppose, that when the reservation was diminished, their fishing rights were in the diminished area or in the area that was excluded were lost for the same reason."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,708.398,709.758,That is correct.
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.619,726.411,But they weren't paid for giving up their fishing rights.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,726.411,730.142,"Well, they were not paid separately as an itemization, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.142,734.505,I thought you said they were paid for the price of lumber... timber.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,734.505,736.344,They were paid to extinguish the--
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,736.344,738.147,So they weren't paid for the fishing rights.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,738.147,745.651,"--They were not paid separately for the fishing rights, Justice Marshall, but I think that is a question of... the compensation issue is two steps removed."
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,745.651,747.832,I just can't get fishing rights over with lumber.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,747.832,749.064,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,749.064,753.338,I can't get fishing rights over with lumber.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,756.928,760.791,You are paying for the land and all that is appurtenant to the land.
1984.83-2148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.908,773.46,It depends on the state.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,781.124,782.245,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.118,804.74,"And that is true, you say, no matter what happened later before the Indian Claims Commission."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,804.74,808.734,"--I am not sure I follow, Justice--"
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.734,813.218,"Well, they were paid... they had another proceeding before the Indian Claims Commission?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,813.218,813.859,--That's correct.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.859,822.334,So you say that the Indian Claims Commission proceeding has no bearing on this general cession language.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,822.334,829.858,The Indian Claims Commission bears only on the adequacy of the compensation that was given for the cession.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.858,841.816,"Did I understand you to say earlier, Mr. Attorney General, that the additional $4 million awarded by the Indian Claims Commission was measured by lumber and something else?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,841.816,842.537,And grazing--
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.537,843.759,Lumber and grazing.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,843.759,849.052,"--because that was the highest and best use for the land, as agreed by counsel for both parties, the tribe and the United States."
1984.83-2148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,854.345,858.219,You were in the process of developing three points.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,862.643,869.645,"Well, the language of the cession agreement, which is the language which is unambiguous."
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.466,1011.568,May I just interrupt with one thought that is troubling me?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1038.169,1053.56,"And I will confess, Justice Stevens, that we are perplexed by that argument, because the question that must be posed to the tribe, it seems to me, is what kind of right is it that is being claimed if it is not a treaty right or if it is not an occupancy right?"
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.297,1090.182,"In other words, perhaps, to be sure I understand your point, you are saying that although theoretically they could exist separate and apart from a piece of land, they don't in this case."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1090.182,1091.033,--That's right.
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.509,1240.711,"Well, if the cession language in the... was it 1906?"
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1240.711,1241.972,"Yes, it was, Justice White."
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.972,1262.947,"If the cession language in the 1906 agreement didn't extinguish fishing rights in the land that was ceded, I would suppose that the Indians would still retain the fishing rights in all the land they gave up in 1964."
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1262.947,1264.636,You mean 1864?
1984.83-2148,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.636,1265.458,Yes.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1265.458,1288.893,"Yes, if this is not language of extinction of rights in and to the land, it is difficult to know what language would accomplish that objective unless it is the claim of the tribe that for everything that was of value to the tribe, there must be a specific inventory in the document of bargain and sale to give some valuation to that right or show that it was conveyed."
1984.83-2148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.164,1338.676,Was that the language of the 1906 agreement?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1344.192,1345.652,--Let me read it precisely.
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.927,1370.661,And that was very similar to the language in the 1864 treaty?
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1370.661,1375.353,"The language in the 1864 treaty was that they cede all their right, title, and claim."
1984.83-2148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.353,1376.034,Yes.
1984.83-2148,0,20835,david_frohnmayer,,1376.034,1390.303,"Ironically enough, the language in the 1906 agreement is almost identical to the language used in the DeCoteau Tribe agreement, which this Court found was precisely suited to effective diminishment of the boundaries of the reservation."
1984.83-2148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1543.412,1551.7,Mr. Miller.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1551.7,1573.301,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the rights at issue here today are basic subsistence rights that continue to this day to play an extremely important role in the day to day lives of the Klamath Tribe and its members."
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.299,1760.525,"What is your response, Mr. Miller, to your opponent's contention that it is a kind of peculiar right that has evolved?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1771.942,1780.297,"Well, I think the Court should keep in mind that the situation of the Klamath Indians is peculiar as well."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.29,1816.341,Has passed to whom?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1816.341,1818.192,--Your Honor?
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.192,1822.075,"The title was given up to the United States, wasn't it?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1822.075,1823.507,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.507,1830.039,"And it was... the land became part of national forest mostly, or parks?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1830.039,1831.691,Virtually all of it.
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.784,1844.511,"Well, normally state hunting and fishing laws apply in national forests and parks, don't they?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1844.511,1846.482,"That's entirely correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.812,1906.021,"Are there other cases in which other Indian tribes have the right broken down this way, where their right doesn't extend to going on private land, and it is simply a matter of being free from state regulation?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1906.021,1920.731,"Well, we are... I am aware of only one, which was a Blackfeet cession Act in 1891, I believe."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.836,1978.617,"May I inquire what... I gather none of the land did go into private ownership in the disputed area here, but had it gone into private ownership... say they had settled a couple of hundred acres or something... would you claim the right to hunt and fish on that private land, hunt and fish on it?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1978.617,1980.628,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.915,1996.75,"So it is just a right to be free... and earlier you said you had four game wardens of your own, or enforcement personnel within the tribe."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1996.75,1997.13,Yes.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.13,2000.961,Do they have enforcement duties in the area that is involved in this case?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2000.961,2008.026,"Well, pending the resolution of this case--"
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.026,2011.548,"Before the case started, did they have such responsibility?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2011.548,2014.941,"--I can't tell you, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.492,2016.441,The record doesn't tell us.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2016.441,2019.423,"The record has nothing, and I can't tell you."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.423,2027.658,Let me ask you another question.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2041.499,2046.001,They would have jurisdiction over only tribal members hunting and fishing.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.141,2062.403,"Do they have limits, too, on how much--"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2062.403,2063.342,--They have limits.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.485,2070.427,"--So there would be two sets of rules on the limits that could be taken from this area, one that would apply to the Indians and one that would apply to the non-Indians."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2070.427,2071.509,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.509,2074.221,And how to fish.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2080.495,2088.62,"I assume that there are as well, Your Honor, but that is really not the major bone of contention here."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.726,2165.24,"Well, could I ask you, if the cession language in the 1906 agreement didn't extinguish fishing rights in the property that was ceded, why would Indian fishing rights have been extinguished in 1864 in the property that was ceded?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2165.24,2179.458,"Your Honor, this Court, I believe, has never required an express or explicit extinguishment of a treaty for hunting and fishing rights."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.458,2185.602,Do you concede that Indian fishing rights on the land that was ceded in 1864 were extinguished?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2185.602,2194.04,"Absolutely, and I will tell you why, because there was a clear expression of Congressional intent in that case as opposed to in this case."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.04,2196.691,"Well, it didn't mention fishing rights off the reservation."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2196.691,2198.772,"No, it did not."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.772,2201.282,And neither did the 1906.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2201.282,2202.314,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.314,2208.528,It just said... I suppose the cession language is even more specific in the 1906 agreement.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2208.528,2213.261,"They are close to the same, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.763,2249.445,In 1864?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2249.445,2251.426,"--In 1864, yes."
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.233,2341.386,"What if there hadn't been that much, Mr. Miller?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2364.291,2378.348,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think that you would have to again look at the circumstances of the particular act and what the intent of the parties and the understanding of the Indians was at the time."
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.348,2388.166,"So, if there were just nothing relevant on either side on that, that general language would not be sufficient, I take it."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2388.166,2393.86,I--
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.86,2396.751,Let me elaborate a little bit.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2449.305,2456.53,"--Well, briefly, it is that the right that we assert is not a right that is appurtenant to the land."
1984.83-2148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.708,2486.579,"So it is basically not a property right at all, but kind of a freedom from state regulation."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2486.579,2503.561,"--It is a freedom from state regulation that has, because of its unique character as such an important right to the Indians, that has some of the characters of a property right."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.656,2578.104,Have we held that such rights survive where you have both the conveyance of the entire property interest and also the diminishment of the reservation?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2578.104,2581.376,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.311,2608.662,"Well, here you have the two things combined."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2619.251,2620.06,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.06,2625.085,And often you might have it survive... say you conveyed land within a reservation.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2628.166,2629.526,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.526,2640.762,"But I am not aware of any cases in which you have the two factors conjoined in which the hunting and fishing rights have survived, both the conveyance of the property and the reduction in the size of the reservation."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2640.762,2647.617,"Well, the Winans decision certainly represents such a case."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.562,2657.044,Wasn't Winans the construction of a treaty which specifically referred to the hunting and fishing rights?
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2657.044,2657.485,--That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.485,2658.344,That was my recollection.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2658.344,2659.205,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.468,2685.883,"If there were a specific case, you probably wouldn't be here, either one of you."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2685.883,2689.666,"I hate to speculate, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.706,2728.1,"Mr. Miller, let me interrupt you once more."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2755.198,2757.419,"No, I--"
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.419,2759.662,They cite this in one of the footnotes in their brief.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2759.662,2761.653,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.376,2800.098,That's right.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2808.803,2809.743,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2809.743,2812.046,But implicitly it was assumed that that must have gone with the--
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2812.046,2813.486,That's correct.
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.546,2976.473,"--Could I ask, does the history show why the Indians sold or why the United States bought that land that had been erroneously surveyed as outside the reservation?"
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3008.225,3014.149,"Well, we don't know, Your Honor, and the record doesn't reflect very much."
1984.83-2148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.687,3092.709,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3109.4,3130.723,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address first a matter that was brought up earlier regarding the question of whether the Indians were paid for the value of this right or whether it was subsumed within the fair market value and highest and best use."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.103,3157.491,"That may be so, but if you assume that the 1906 agreement ceded all rights, all that happened before the Indian Claim Commission was that they reevaluated whatever was ceded."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3157.491,3160.603,"Well, the key is all rights or--"
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.603,3163.625,"I agree, but you have to go back to the 1906 agreement."
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3163.625,3164.707,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.707,3165.646,Okay.
1984.83-2148,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3165.646,3178.335,"Now, the state has argued that this is an anomalous, very different, almost an oddball right, that this would be the only place where it would exist."
1984.83-2148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3357.114,3361.064,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1984.83-2148,2,20835,david_frohnmayer,,3361.064,3363.786,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-2148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3588.453,3589.344,"Thank you, gentlemen."
