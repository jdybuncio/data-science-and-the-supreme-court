1984.83-1132,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 83-1132, Park 'N Fly, Incorporated, against Dollar Park and Fly."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,13.158,16.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1132,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.846,391.966,"When you say can't be enforced, Mr. Popkin, you mean that your client could not get an injunction--"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,391.966,392.7,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.7,393.751,--to prevent the use by someone else?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,393.751,394.317,Exactly so.
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.102,428.137,You made a point of the fact that the Court of Appeals made the finding more or less on its own.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,428.137,428.739,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.739,434.041,Would it be a different case if the district court had made a finding and you agreed that the finding was correct?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,434.041,437.928,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it would be significantly different, because--"
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.928,443.498,"Can we assume for purposes of decision that the mark will be treated as though it is descriptive, as they say?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,443.498,446.45,"--No, I don't think we can assume that the mark is descriptive, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.741,461.327,"Well, I understand."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,468.031,474.451,I'm saying that the issue of whether or not the mark is descriptive is ruled out by the incontestability provision.
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,494.431,495.564,"Well, I understand."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,508.206,512.158,"That would be so, yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.574,520.264,"Let me pursue this just a little further, because I'm confused by your answers to Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,536.373,538.991,"--Yes, Your Honor, you may approach it in that way."
1984.83-1132,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.975,745.626,"Your opponent, of course, contends that, because the registration proceeding in the Trademark Officer is essentially administrative or ex parte, if your construction is adopted all sorts of marks that don't really qualify under the Lanham Act will get registered and there will be never any adversary process for challenging them."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,747.942,749.328,"I say two things to that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.142,905.696,"Is it your position, Mr. Popkin, that those are the only defenses that are ever available?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,905.696,906.346,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.346,907.982,That's an exhaustive list?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,907.982,908.432,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.479,1151.353,Is it true that a mark that has been issued or granted can become generic?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1151.353,1152.437,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.437,1155.674,Let's suppose an incontestable mark becomes generic.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1155.674,1156.691,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.691,1158.876,What about your theory then?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1158.876,1161.911,"Genericness is one of the seven defenses that Congress has written, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.911,1163.578,Where does that fall?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1163.578,1167.648,I think it's 1115(b).
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.504,1179.372,"1164, but it's not in--"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1179.372,1181.056,"Commonly descriptive, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.056,1185.11,--But it's not in 1115(b)?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1185.11,1193.78,"I believe it's incorporated under the provisions of 1064 (c), which are incorporated into 1115(b)."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.033,1234.674,"Would it be open in a case like this for the Defendant in the action you brought to say, well, it was generic when it was issued?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1234.674,1235.376,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.661,1254.587,"But you think that's the only... because the essence of your opponent's case, I guess, is that your mark should never have been issued, or that it certainly shouldn't have been made incontestable."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1254.587,1255.454,The essence is--
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.454,1257.972,And that it was just merely descriptive.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1257.972,1258.672,--That is part--
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.672,1272.732,"And you say that Congress itself has said that the mark could be cancelled if it was generic or becomes generic, but it didn't say merely descriptiveness would be a ground?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1272.732,1279.802,--It's quite clear that mere descriptiveness is not a grounds for a defense to incontestability.
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.271,1285.073,"Expressly, you say?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1285.073,1287.492,"Expressly, yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1287.492,1293.895,Could it have been argued successfully that the mark had never acquired a secondary meaning?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1293.895,1297.763,"Your Honor, secondary meaning is not an issue."
1984.83-1132,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1297.763,1305.536,"I understand that, but could it have been injected as an issue if it had been alleged by your Respondent?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1305.536,1309.155,"No, Your Honor, not under the construction that we contend."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.085,1410.204,"Mr. Popkin, can you help me again?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1415.857,1416.324,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.324,1425.296,"And I also understood you to say, in response to Justice White, that the defense of genericness is available, but you didn't tell us which of the seven paragraphs it's in."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1425.296,1438.556,"If Your Honor please, I think that 1064(c) is incorporated into the body of 1115(b)."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.223,1443.158,But then that's something in addition to the seven defenses.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1443.158,1445.86,It's part... it is incorporated into it.
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.312,1450.598,So then the seven defenses is not an exhaustive list?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1450.598,1453.133,It is not an exhaustive list in the sense that there--
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.133,1458.101,"Are there others beside genericness in addition to the seven, other defenses?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1458.101,1465.023,"--Well, 1064(c) is duplicative in a number of aspects."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.258,1494.977,But it's not listed in the seven.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1507.2,1512.068,There are other defenses which have specifically been incorporated.
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.037,1518.489,But not in 1115.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1518.489,1523.81,"They're not listed in the body of the section, but they are specifically referred to by the section."
1984.83-1132,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.81,1527.178,Where does the incorporation take place?
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1530.898,1534.683,Let's see if I can find it precisely for Your Honor.
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.354,1544.539,"--1064 is the cancellation section, isn't it?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1544.539,1545.256,Yes.
1984.83-1132,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.744,1579.279,Okay.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1579.279,1617.904,"There is a... I wanted to speak briefly about the way in which this offensive-defensive dichotomy arose, and it has a long history that goes back to 1955, when the Patent and Trademark Office issued their Rand McNally decision, and in 1961 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decided the John Morrell case, which adopted an offensive-defensive dichotomy, really on very little basis."
1984.83-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1726.539,1742.735,"Well, Mr. Popkin, I suppose the Respondent has raised certain defenses and argues that the trial court ruling on the local use exception defense, for example, was erroneous."
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1753.324,1753.826,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.491,1781.01,"Well, it just didn't address it, did it?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1781.01,1781.726,It did not.
1984.83-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.726,1788.514,"So I suppose it would be open to the Ninth Circuit to at least review that finding on the remand, would it not?"
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1788.514,1791.901,I think it would be open to review that to find if the judge was clearly erroneous.
1984.83-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1791.901,1793.784,Yes.
1984.83-1132,0,16729,alan_e_popkin,,1793.784,1799.055,"Whatever time remaining I have, I would like to have for rebuttal, if Your Honor please."
1984.83-1132,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1799.055,1805.808,Mr. McCormack.
1984.83-1132,1,32017,john_m_mccormack,,1805.808,1809.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1132,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1825.436,1827.805,Under what section?
1984.83-1132,1,32017,john_m_mccormack,,1827.805,1830.423,"Under Section 1052(e), Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3568.853,3570.669,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.343,3637.129,"Well, suppose one of the defenses is proved in 1115."
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3639.247,3639.897,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1132,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.897,3647.134,"Not just whether you can prevent somebody else from using, not just to your exclusive right?"
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3647.134,3652.205,"In a trademark infringement action, Your Honor, there are two issues involved."
1984.83-1132,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3699.436,3701.769,Let me ask you a concrete question.
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3701.769,3702.703,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1132,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.703,3710.207,"Mr. Popkin, suppose they put up a sign in just large, bold-faced type: ""Park/Fly""."
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3716.295,3716.98,What do I think of it?
1984.83-1132,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.888,3731.305,Yes.
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3734.859,3736.225,"An enviable position, Your Honor."
1984.83-1132,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3738.311,3740.127,What would you do?
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3740.863,3742.529,I would find that confusingly similar.
1984.83-1132,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3753.82,3754.57,Very well.
1984.83-1132,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3755.188,3756.138,"Mr. Popkin, can I ask you--"
1984.83-1132,2,16729,alan_e_popkin,,3771.898,3773.681,"Yes, Your Honor."
