2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.504,"Our second case is Case 12-417, Sandifer v. United States Steel."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,7.387,9.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,52.466,52.899,I resent that.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,54.651,60.489,"And nor are neck braces, which I've seen one in this courtroom."
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.071,140.787,Tools and what?
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,140.787,141.856,Scabbards.
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.856,142.689,Scabbards.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,142.689,143.239,Knife scabbards.
2013.12-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.974,155.463,"But we're dealing with here, from the picture, that looks like clothes to me."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,155.463,160.182,"Your Honor, I think that your question raises an excellent point."
2013.12-417,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.924,177.326,"Except you would look and say, those clothes probably have something special underneath them."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,185.066,191.903,"--If you saw an airbag jacket, you would probably call it clothes unless you are an equestrian."
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,204.294,207.595,Why is it that the jacket and the pants in that picture are not clothes?
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,207.595,219.737,"In our view -- well, let me -- part of it -- first of all, they are designed for a protective function, to protect you from catching fire."
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,219.737,223.955,This is one of the aspects of your argument that seems really puzzling to me.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,250.856,251.539,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,281.576,286.545,"So if it -- if it protects against something other than workplace hazard, it can be clothes."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,291.166,296.487,And it's designed to provide that kind of protection.
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,319.017,320.517,What if you are working out in the sun?
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,331.075,334.11,--I don't think in ordinary parlance they would be called a workplace hazard.
2013.12-417,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,340.014,347.601,So the guy who works in a freezer is not experiencing a normal hazard?
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,351.587,372.735,--I submit -- I think that -- that you would be wearing a parka in a freezer just because it was warmer.
2013.12-417,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,384.726,390.363,--So you have to pay a worker who's in the South Pole overtime for putting on his parka?
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,390.363,392.514,"--Well, you put on more than a parka."
2013.12-417,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,394.998,397.017,To put on his leggings and things like that.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,397.017,398.833,--There's a whole lot of stuff that I'm sure he puts on.
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.833,402.254,I lived in Chicago when it never got above zero for two weeks.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,402.254,407.908,There would come a point where I think people would call it a hazard in ordinary English.
2013.12-417,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,407.908,408.658,But--
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,408.658,411.61,But those are not the cases that come up.
2013.12-417,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.304,442.511,"I have -- I do have an understanding that you're right, that jewelry are not clothes, that toupees might not be, that makeup is not, and they cover the body."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,473.215,481.237,I'm not entirely sure where -- what we would fall back to.
2013.12-417,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.741,490.509,It's a very famous saying.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,491.843,492.359,"Right, right."
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.724,519.11,You don't want to say they are “ wearing guns ” in this case.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,519.443,520.91,"--No, they are wearing camouflage and holding guns."
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.91,521.81,And holding guns.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,521.81,522.495,Holding.
2013.12-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.147,580.865,I have an underlying question just for my understanding of this.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,634.133,635.649,I am delighted to answer that question.
2013.12-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.657,649.973,Right.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,649.973,652.609,That is not what the statute says and it's not the way it works.
2013.12-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.8,691.634,"I see, that's where the problem lies."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,691.634,692.186,--it goes the other way.
2013.12-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.186,697.388,"Is there a way around that that doesn't involve this case, the Secretary of Labor?"
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,703.242,707.678,"That's the way the statute works now, and that explains -- it's part of the reason why they are there."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.371,898.954,Counsel--
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,898.954,900.487,"Sorry that's so long, but that's why."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,900.487,902.856,--We began with the assumption that the unions are on your side.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,905.625,907.227,"No, they have not filed."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,912.044,918.615,"Well, it does seem to support to notion that this is something that should be left to the collective bargaining process."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,918.615,937.179,"Your Honor, it's not being -- the view of -- of the opponents of this kind of proposal, which was defeated repeatedly directed, was it isn't being let -- you're -- you're essentially carving unionized plants out of the protections of the statutes."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,943.75,950.92,"No, the point would be that the steelworkers gave up something when -- you know, it's part of a bargain."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,972.849,977.068,"--If I -- again, if I might return to the first part of my answer to Justice Breyer's question."
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1023.23,1034.088,"No, but if the union -- is it consistent with the union's duty to represent your client for them to bargain away something to which your clients are entitled under the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1034.088,1040.158,The company's position is it's -- it's not something that they're entitled to.
2013.12-417,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1040.158,1041.175,"No, no, the union."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1042.142,1043.877,I -- I understand -- I understand the question.
2013.12-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.78,1054.949,"Mr. Schnapper, can I ask you another question?"
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1107.348,1107.731,--Okay.
2013.12-417,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1140.219,1146.54,"--But I thought that your distinction was well, there are two sets of clothes, to use a better word."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1179.861,1193.354,"Well, Your Honor, I think in ordinary parlance, whether you're going to call something clothes or not depends, as the government says at page 25 of its brief, on both its form and its function."
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.738,1196.988,Yes.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1254.375,1254.891,All right.
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.9,1271.219,"No, but you have taken it on."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1278.64,1279.256,--Your Honor--
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.256,1283.444,And I suggest the ordinary meaning is not -- is not what you -- you have proposed.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1283.444,1285.879,"--Well, we may disagree of the substance, but--"
2013.12-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.879,1295.485,"It includes protective garments, and -- and you want it to include all protective garments, I guess, except those that protect against workplace hazards."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1297.518,1301.655,--All -- all we're asking the Court to hold is that certain things are not clothes.
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1363.462,1369.616,"Counsel, the whole approach here -- you are saying you are not going to give us a test, you are just going to criticize--"
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1369.616,1370.366,"--No, no, no."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.366,1370.933,--their test.
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1370.933,1371.449,No.
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.713,1487.708,"What about heavy duty pants, you know, blue jeans that somebody -- the thick ones that you use because the work environment will involve, you know, grease and hot things and all, but that you wouldn't necessarily or a particular worker wouldn't wear off the steel mill site?"
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1496.547,1499.582,"--Certainly, people wear blue jeans under all sorts of circumstances."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1499.582,1510.64,"Yes, yes, but there are heavier-duty blue jeans that are made out of a particular fabric that you would see commonly in the steel mill, but you maybe wouldn't see commonly outside."
2013.12-417,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1510.64,1523.298,"If -- if there was something identifiable in the -- in the -- in the mill that was -- that was a hazard, that might fall there."
2013.12-417,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.075,1542.675,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1547.846,1551.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1658.819,1660.602,Does that include a scuba tank?
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1660.602,1662.121,--Your Honor--
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1662.121,1665.49,Because you can wear anything to be ready for work.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1679.15,1680.333,--If the labor--
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1680.333,1681.4,Or ready for work.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1681.4,1699.979,"--If the labor organization and the employer, for whatever odd reason, would decide that part of the outfit you need to be ready to go to work included the tank -- it doesn't make a lot of sense because it would make more sense to put the tank on when you get to the location where you are going to perform your principal activities."
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1707.75,1711.202,Then why didn't -- why wasn't the statute written that way?
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1711.202,1712.287,--It wasn't written that way--
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1712.287,1718.375,"Why wasn't it written -- I mean they use very specific words, “ changing clothes ”."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1722.26,1727.647,"--Well, Your Honor, they use those words with other words when they say"
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.65,1761.152,"Yes, what I think he's saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big deal for the unions?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,1818.906,1827.179,"--So for the first part of the question, the notion of custom or practice is a notion of agreement or, at the very least, long-time acquiescence."
2013.12-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.511,1977.923,"Mr. DiNardo, in this case, does it matter if we take your position that anything you need to wear to be ready for work or the government's position -- and I think it was the Seventh Circuit's position, too -- that equipment is different from clothes?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2012.663,2016.548,"So in our particular case, Your Honor, this does not matter."
2013.12-417,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2041.415,2041.782,"Well, what would it matter?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2047.569,2063.763,"Well, it'll make a difference, Your Honor, in -- in all of those circumstances where part of the outfit that you put on to wear to be ready to work is not something that one might, absent an industrial context, look at and say intuitively, that's clothing."
2013.12-417,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2063.763,2065.631,"Well, like what, that's not de minimis?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2065.631,2072.302,"So, for -- for example -- well, in many respects, I should say, these sorts of items are, in fact, de minimis."
2013.12-417,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2098.686,2104.09,"I guess it just seems that in most of these cases, everybody is just going to say it takes two seconds to put on a pair of eyeglasses."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2112.012,2116.064,"Well, again, we're not fighting that hard because they -- they urge affirmance."
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.487,2159.659,I think -- I think the government is -- you and the government are fighting simply because the government is being principled.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2200.084,2205.971,"It -- it does mean something, but it must be read as part of any time spent--"
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.971,2206.471,Why would it be difficult?
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2224.366,2228.234,--The -- the statute is activity focused.
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.434,2231.119,"Well, is there anything wrong with what I just said?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2231.119,2231.719,"--There is, Your Honor."
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.719,2231.969,What?
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2231.969,2233.719,So what of opening your locker?
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.171,2236.787,Opening your locker is not clothes.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2237.221,2238.306,"--Yet, the time is excluded."
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.856,2242.891,"Well, that's not -- but still, we're back to the statute which says “ clothes ”."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2242.891,2243.291,Yes.
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.291,2247.11,"And therefore, what's wrong with the definition I just proposed?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2247.11,2252.93,"Well, as a practical matter, labor organizations and employers don't negotiate that way."
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.299,2259.768,"Well, that's -- that's up to them how they negotiate."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2273.093,2273.343,Unless it's in the collective--
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.343,2274.276,Or custom and--
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2274.276,2280.347,--And then you look up the definition of clothes and it's any covering for the human body and it includes accessories.
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.347,2280.763,--No.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2287.85,2293.754,"The safety glasses that go over the eyeglasses are, in fact, designed to cover the -- part of the face."
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.523,2299.908,"Well, if it doesn't matter, why make a liar out of us?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2306.911,2308.78,--But it's not everything you put on.
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.548,2312.115,"Earrings, eyeglasses, whatever."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2312.115,2318.902,It would be the work outfit that the employer and the union agreed you need to have on your person to be ready for work.
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.902,2324.623,You -- you cannot get that very precise limitation out of the word “ clothes ”.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2342.501,2351.623,It's -- it's less required for work as it is -- the Congress was after allowing this block of time to be dealt with.
2013.12-417,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.623,2355.492,"So maybe we can call them constructive clothes, which means they're not clothes."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2356.775,2361.927,And it's less the individual nature of the item as it is the activity.
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2390.277,2397.364,Your definition would include somebody spending an hour of putting on a suit of armor if he's going to be a jouster.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2407.152,2412.29,"--Well, I would suggest -- I would suggest that what it's made of should not matter."
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2413.473,2414.058,Right.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2414.058,2415.208,The function shouldn't matter.
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2416.708,2420.312,"If function doesn't matter, then how do we define “ clothes ”?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2420.312,2422.679,--The function doesn't matter because--
2013.12-417,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.679,2423.931,Function covers the body.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2423.931,2427.883,--Sometimes it could be for protection; sometimes it could be for identification.
2013.12-417,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2473.347,2475.664,"Well, nothing has been said about the word “ changing ”."
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2490.992,2502.45,"So I would say this: In this particular case, the facts of this case, and the record's replete with declarations, the most common event is a worker comes to his locker, takes off some of their clothes."
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.983,2641.188,"Are there no non-unionized employers that -- that have to confront this problem, and they have to pay -- they have to pay for work time, no?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2641.188,2646.508,So the statute only covers -- 203(o) only applies in unionized workplaces.
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.11,2654.431,"Yes, and everybody else has to pay for the changing time, right?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2654.431,2656.45,--Unless it's preliminary or postliminary.
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.45,2659.152,"It is, so you -- so you have the same issue there, don't you?"
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2659.152,2660.535,"Well, yes -- it's--"
2013.12-417,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.535,2664.97,And -- and the union cannot pull your chestnuts out of the fire.
2013.12-417,1,34319,lawrence_c_dinardo,,2664.97,2670.458,"--Well, of course, there is no union present, so the question becomes is it preliminary activity?"
2013.12-417,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.354,2691.354,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2700.479,2702.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2013.12-417,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2702.695,2708.249,"Mr. Yang, I will let you speak, but could you answer Justice Scalia's question?"
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2723.075,2723.775,--Not at all.
2013.12-417,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2859.564,2863.085,So then what does separate you from Mr. DiNardo?
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2864.618,2868.989,"Well, no, I don't think so, because on the margin, we are largely the same."
2013.12-417,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2890.835,2891.152,Like what?
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2891.152,2896.239,"Well, this is an area -- an issue that comes up frequently in the meat packing industry."
2013.12-417,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2969.27,2970.287,So what's the difference?
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2985.63,2985.847,Right.
2013.12-417,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2993.22,2996.672,"Well, actually, that's what we are looking for, so why don't you?"
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2996.838,2997.538,"No, no."
2013.12-417,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3010.78,3013.698,"What you just said -- what you just said, I find quite confusing."
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3036.897,3045.853,"--Our point is a linguistic point, which is to say I don't think all these things are normally characterized as clothing."
2013.12-417,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3121.236,3137.029,"But when somebody in the meat packing industry puts on something that would be clothing but also puts on all these other things that you say are not clothing, you would say in that situation putting on all this additional stuff is not ancillary, and that is for what reason?"
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3147.201,3154.907,"Well, I think it means that when the process is predominantly involving equipment and not clothes, we would think that it's different."
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3187.478,3195.399,"Do you have any estimate on the empirical -- there are only two people that know, the Department of Labor and the AFL-CIO, and they didn't tell us, the latter."
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3222.033,3222.716,I'm not -- there has to be--
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.716,3223.549,Do you follow?
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3224.266,3227.984,--There has to be a custom or practice under the collective bargaining agreement.
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3227.984,3228.334,"--Yes, yes."
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3228.718,3229.084,The specific one.
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3229.084,3230.77,--collective bargaining agreements in steel forever.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3247.295,3248.381,"Well, I think the custom--"
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.381,3249.131,I wonder if anyone knows.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3249.131,3250.414,--on the record in this case--
2013.12-417,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.414,3251.014,I don't know.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3251.014,3254.899,--I think the custom of practice was to not separately compensate.
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3254.899,3255.449,All right.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3256.182,3258.434,So that was actually made express--
2013.12-417,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.434,3259.134,--Exactly.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3259.134,3259.734,--in this case.
2013.12-417,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.39,3298.025,You want us to say it's incidental instead of de minimis.
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3298.025,3299.859,--That's -- that's our preference.
2013.12-417,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.859,3302.061,What -- what's the consequence of calling it incidental?
2013.12-417,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3302.061,3311.767,"Well, we think it avoids the complications and problems with the special doctrine that applies more generally in the FLSA, which is the de minimis -- De Minimis Time Doctrine."
2013.12-417,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3311.767,3313.035,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-417,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3314.669,3321.54,I'd like to address a number of questions that were asked earlier and then to respond to a point my brother made.
2013.12-417,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3523.619,3525.119,Mr. Schnapper -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-417,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3525.119,3529.023,What is the practice in the poultry industry to which you referred?
2013.12-417,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3532.558,3534.927,I believe about 60 percent are and the rest are not.
2013.12-417,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3537.279,3543.699,"And under -- where they have collective bargaining agreements, are they compensated for this time or not?"
2013.12-417,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3543.699,3544.866,Generally not.
2013.12-417,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3555.09,3558.975,Do you happen to know why the government hasn't issued a regulation on this?
2013.12-417,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3578.536,3579.805,"I do not know, Your Honor."
2013.12-417,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3579.805,3581.99,Too complicated is why.
2013.12-417,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3583.623,3586.792,If the Court has no further questions.
2013.12-417,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3586.792,3587.644,"Thank you, counsel."
