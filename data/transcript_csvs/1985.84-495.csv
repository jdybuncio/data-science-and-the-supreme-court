1985.84-495,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.872,We will hear arguments first this morning in Thornburgh against American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,14.433,30.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal is from a decision of the Third Circuit, which in reviewing a preliminary injunction ruling struck down numerous provisions of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act."
1985.84-495,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,85.842,92.762,"Mr. Gordon, just as a matter of curiosity, is Governor Thornburgh still a party to this litigation?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,92.762,105.726,"The parties did agree that he should be removed, but the District Court never entered an order on that, so technically I believe he still is a party, but he will be removed as soon as it is returned to the District Court and the District Court issues an order."
1985.84-495,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,105.726,116.533,"Well, the case comes up here in a posture with a high official of Pennsylvania as the lead name, and he vetoed all this legislation."
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,119.189,122.969,"Well, if I may, he vetoed a prior bill."
1985.84-495,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,130.091,132.543,But you are taking the position he still is a party?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,132.543,135.042,--There has been no order of dismissal issued.
1985.84-495,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,135.042,138.354,Even though the parties have agreed that he should go out.
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,138.354,139.463,Yes.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,251.355,253.854,You mean 1254 when you say that?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,253.854,255.589,"--Twelve fifty-four two, that's right."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,256.618,268.536,"In other words, because Congress didn't say final judgment expressly, the inference is that Congress intended appealability even when there wasn't a final judgment?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,268.536,271.988,"--I think it certainly permits that conclusion, but that is not our entire argument."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.751,289.918,"Well, to the extent you base your argument on it at all, what does that do with 1254(1), which allows cert, as you know, before or after rendition of a judgment or decree?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,292.276,297.274,"No, I don't believe so; 1254(2) applies to a very narrow class of cases."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.274,298.867,I am talking about 1254(1).
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,298.867,304.366,"Well, I know, and 1254(1) obviously applies to the broader range of cases."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,352.893,355.142,"Well, I know, but the question is whether there is a final judgment."
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,355.142,358.001,We don't argue that there is a final judgment in this case.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.001,360.874,But you say it is nonetheless appealable under 1254(2).
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,360.874,361.436,"Yes, we do."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.436,376.46,I am wondering why you can't read 1254(2) as Congress intending the long time requirement of final judgment obtained here and that 1254(1) was simply an exception.
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,376.46,378.367,"Well, we understand--"
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.367,379.663,Why can't it be read that way?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,379.663,400.904,"--Well, the absence of the word ""final"" permits a reading either way, but it is our position that the general rule of finality does not, cannot, and should not be followed when there are particular policies which are relevant to a specific statute, and which support the conclusion that non-final review should be permitted."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,405.698,417.053,"Yes, but if we have to read 1254(2) as Congress telling us that you couldn't appeal anything here except a final judgment, that controls us, doesn't it?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,417.053,419.96,--I am not sure that I understand your question.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.053,423.411,"A final judgment, then--"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,424.958,429.299,--Then we request that the Court grant certiorari in this case.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,461.224,473.657,"Getting back, if I may, since I had to interrupt, now, as I understand it, there are apparently several provisions of this Pennsylvania statute still before the District Court, are there not?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,473.657,474.063,--That's right.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.063,477.688,"And as to the five... there are five here, are there not?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,477.688,478.031,Yes.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.031,491.54,"And as to those five, did not the stipulation of facts expressly reserve the right to make a record in the District Court so that our holdings could be, I gather, changed by subsequent factual developments?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,491.54,495.726,That was certainly the intention at the time when that stipulation was entered into.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.726,499.755,Why should we treat with these important questions now?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,506.347,511.985,"Well, the problem is that the Court of Appeals issued a final judgment as to these particular statutes in this case."
1985.84-495,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.166,537.819,"Well, would you be satisfied if we simply said the Court of Appeals erred in entering a final Judgment on those issues?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,541.566,543.441,"No, we wouldn't be satisfied with that."
1985.84-495,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.441,543.972,I wouldn't think you would be.
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,546.159,547.112,"Well, let me tell you why."
1985.84-495,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.949,573.383,So you would have attempted to come here anyway if the Court of Appeals had just said the preliminary injunction was all right?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,573.383,576.413,"Well, I am not certain that we would have."
1985.84-495,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.413,586.674,"Well, if you wouldn't, why should we do anything more than affirm them as to the preliminary injunction?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,586.674,611.023,"Well, the difference is this, first of all, that that isn't what they did, and it is clear, I would think, that if that is all this Court does, then it would be an exercise in futility for us to go back to the District Court anyhow, because no District Judge is going to be able to look beyond the fact that the Court of Appeals reached the merits, and feels rather strongly, to say the least, that these provisions are unconstitutional."
1985.84-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.85,628.157,"Mr. Gordon, for which of the statutes at issue here is there in your view a need for additional factual record before a final adjudication on constitutionality is proper?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,628.157,640.965,--Let me say that it is our position based upon the appellee's apparent conception that they have no additional evidence to offer that the Court may reach the merits and uphold these statutes based on this record.
1985.84-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,644.104,653.975,"Well, you take the position then that no additional factual record is necessary for the final decision on any of these statutes and their validity?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,653.975,658.129,--We take the position that the Court may uphold these statutes based on this record.
1985.84-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.224,703.752,Do you take the position that abstention is appropriate as to any of the statutes to allow the state courts to interpret them?
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,703.752,707.813,I am not sure that it would be feasible.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.538,744.549,"May I ask, Mr. Gordon, did I correctly understand that the reservation to make a further factual showing may be triggered by either party?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,744.549,747.048,At the District Court level?
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.048,747.345,Yes.
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,747.345,747.798,Absolutely.
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,750.672,754.06,"Well, I am speaking as to the five provisions before us."
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,764.415,766.415,"As to those and all of the issues that were involved, yes."
1985.84-495,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.415,773.005,"Yes, and that reservation may be triggered without regard to what the Court may think by either party to the stipulation?"
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,773.005,775.832,That was certainly our understanding when we entered into it.
1985.84-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.455,940.86,"Mr. Gordon, it would help me a little bit if in your argument you would identify the sections you are talking about as you go along."
1985.84-495,0,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,941.642,942.75,--Okay.
1985.84-495,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.686,1343.481,Very well.
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1343.949,1358.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on at least 12 occasions since 1973 this Court has been called upon to define the scope of a woman's fundamental right to choose abortion."
1985.84-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.633,1435.319,"Well, does 1254(2) by itself speak in terms of finality?"
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1435.319,1447.985,"Your Honor, it does not, but in 1891, in a case called MacLeish versus Roth, this Court found that the absence of the word ""finality"" did not mean that finality was not required."
1985.84-495,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1488.485,1507.618,Would it then have been enough if the Court of Appeals had said because of possible doubts about constitutionality it would simply enter the preliminary injunction and let events take their normal course?
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1507.618,1536.169,"Your Honor, we believe that the Court of Appeals could have easily done what it did, which is reach facial constitutionality of the five provisions which it held unconstitutional, because as a matter of law the District Court had applied both the wrong standard and there was no possible way to construe the statutes in a constitutional manner, but yes, we were before the Court of Appeals asking for the vacation of denial of the preliminary injunction, and that would have been fine for us at that time."
1985.84-495,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.169,1545.774,"Undoubtedly when lawyers go in to get a TRO or even at the preliminary injunction stage they aren't ready always to litigate constitutionality on a complex matter, are they?"
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1545.774,1547.758,"No, and we were not, Your Honor."
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.153,1578.949,Did you urge the Court of Appeals to rule finally on the constitutionality?
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1578.949,1581.745,"Yes and no, Your Honor."
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.801,1606.798,"Well, if there is no appellate jurisdiction, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be jurisdiction by certiorari."
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1606.798,1608.642,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.809,1623.229,We have never held that finality is required in certiorari jurisdiction.
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1623.229,1629.086,"No, Your Honor, but there are some requirements of certiorari jurisdiction which are not met here."
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.472,1641.674,"That has been enough to get certiorari here in many, many cases."
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1641.674,1643.424,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.903,1659.995,But at least we would have to determine to deny certiorari.
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1659.995,1664.337,--This Court would only have to determine--
1985.84-495,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.337,1670.272,"Well, they ask us to treat it as certiorari, if there is no appellate jurisdiction, so we would have to deny."
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1670.272,1672.381,--You would have to deny certiorari.
1985.84-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.161,1682.689,"Ms. Kolbert, in the reply brief that your opponent filed, they point out the Walters case where it came up on a preliminary injunction."
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1685.704,1704.664,"--Your Honor, this Court has long distinguished Section 1254(2) from Section 1252, which was the Walters case, and in fact 1252 does contain explicit language that allows both appeals from final orders and appeals from interlocutory orders."
1985.84-495,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2203.447,2204.899,May I ask a question?
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,2212.553,2215.739,"Your Honor, the reports have not yet become public."
1985.84-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.915,2283.086,You say these reports have not been made public.
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,2287.755,2291.02,The reports at issue here are not being kept.
1985.84-495,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2407.987,2417.031,"May I ask before you go on, is the physician required to advise the woman that the father will support the child?"
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,2417.031,2418.719,"--Yes, he is, Your Honor."
1985.84-495,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2425.698,2443.77,"In view of statistics as to the number of unwed mothers that have children, what does an unwed mother understand when she is told that the father of the child will support--"
1985.84-495,1,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,2443.77,2480.443,"Your Honor, it is our view that to tell the woman that the father is liable for support, given the national crisis in the collection of child support enforcement orders that Congress has recognized, and the difficulty in the collecting of support may in many cases be misleading, but in addition to inform that, to use... to provide that information to certain women, such as a rape victim who must be informed that her assailant is liable for the support of her child if she carries the pregnancy to term can be extremely cruel and traumatic in that situation, and may force her to relive that trauma."
1985.84-495,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.585,2636.74,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1985.84-495,2,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2636.74,2638.958,"No, Your Honor, I have nothing further."
1985.84-495,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2638.958,2641.255,"Thank you, counsel."
