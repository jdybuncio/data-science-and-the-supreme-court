1967.597,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.268,Versus United Shoe Machinery Corporation.
1967.597,0,21634,donald_f_turner,,36.68,40.134,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2358.324,2362.602,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.803,2437.986,"Well, what about -- what about selling it an unreasonably high price?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2437.986,2438.571,There's no indication --
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.571,2440.395,If that could ever be determined?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2440.395,2444.386,"That would remain to be determined on new issues and new showings of fact, Mr. Justice White."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.386,2449.792,But that -- but selling at a high enough price I suppose could have knocked the monopolization if you had the power.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2449.792,2453.885,"If you had the market power sufficient to exclude, yes."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.885,2461.877,"As for your customers, they might have some problem with the -- with the two high prices because your competitor's prices were too low."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2462.572,2467.984,That could also be examined into but none of that is in this record.
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.984,2468.31,Yes.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2468.31,2493.468,"And I think that I can demonstrate by the reference to the findings as to the entry of new competition and the profitability of new competitors that the price control, which you referred to, Mr. Justice White, could not be in this record."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.465,3032.86,"Well, what if the market power hadn't gone down any."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3032.86,3034.45,"I didn't understand, Mr. Justice."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.45,3037.51,"What if the -- what if the power, the share of --"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3037.51,3038.707,Had not gone down at all?
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.707,3039.851,Yes.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3039.851,3044.434,I would think the Court would have to conclude the Decree had not operated as intended.
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.434,3054.599,Because you would think that the aim of the Decree is not only in monopolization but monopoly power?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3054.599,3068.132,"I think I could say, Your Honor that the aim of the Decree was to extirpate the practices for in number in clause four of the Decree."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.149,3106.387,"You don't think the Decree necessarily -- as long as someone can say that there's no monopolization -- well, if there is no monopolization after the Decree has entered, do you suggest it must do more than that?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3106.387,3107.272,"No, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.551,3131.631,"That if the monopoly power doesn't decline, there really is monopolization?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3131.631,3132.059,"No, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.395,3140.692,Because otherwise -- there must be something going on that's exclusive where competition would erode this power.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3140.692,3142.249,"Well, I think that's right."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.157,3220.439,"Well, I know, but I suppose it's one thing to argue that -- if you assume the Decree is supposed to dissipate monopoly power --"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3220.439,3221.486,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.486,3227.829,-- then I suppose you make one kind of argument as to whether it's been dissipated when you get to 70 to 62%.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3234.654,3240.069,Monopoly power has to be dissipated by the removal of monopolization.
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.545,3293.956,"Well, at least that would be true as long as he accepted the government's view that there wasn't any monopolization."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3293.956,3295.192,"Yes, yes."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3313.31,3318.695,"Mr. Carson, I'm not sure that I quite understand you on one point."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3325.296,3325.373,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3325.373,3348.353,"And let's assume that the government comes in and demonstrates that working in that intended fashion, the Decree did not accomplish the purpose of this that it was intended to accomplish, is that a basis for reopening the Decree at the instance of the government?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3348.353,3365.323,"I would say that if there are no new facts following Your Honor's questions that it worked as it was intended, then there is no basis for reopening since this Decree contemplated a gradual erosion."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3366.665,3382.604,"Well, as I understand Judge Wyzanski's standard, he says -- as I understand it, he made a distinction between situation A in which the Decree had not worked as expected."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3437.578,3438.363,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3447.566,3448.975,"Well, suppose it did not."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3448.975,3449.73,Oh!
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3449.73,3455.518,Suppose that it worked as foreseen just exactly the way we're supposed to work.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3468.458,3469.792,Yes.
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3469.792,3477.367,And would an action by the government to reopen the Decree allowed?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3477.367,3479.184,I think it would.
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3479.184,3486.993,"In that respect, you differ from Judge Wyzanski as I understand it if you take a look at his opinion on page 82 of the record?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3486.993,3488.962,"I did not think so, sir."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3488.962,3491.275,"Well, I may be wrong and that's what I'm trying to get at here."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3491.275,3495.339,I think his opinion on page 82 --
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3495.339,3496.872,The last four paragraph.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3496.872,3500.136,Yes.
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3833.422,3855.798,"Well, I asked Mr. Turner whether he thought we have before as the issue or as to whether Judge Wyzanski applied the proper standard or whether we had before us a question of whether applying the proper standard he reached the right resolve and as I understand them."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3966.953,3973.692,"Well, Your Honor, I do realize that the government said the proper standard was not applied."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4011.268,4014.257,"Well, let me put it this way, and I won't butt in more, Mr. Carson."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4014.257,4014.617,I appreciate the question.
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4014.617,4032.162,"Suppose the Decree says -- the Decree requires accommodated to do A, B, and C and it's a monopoly case, and then let's suppose several years later, the government comes in and it says the company has done A, B and C but it's still a monopoly."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4041.643,4042.067,On that --
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4042.067,4045.861,-- upon which relief may be granted if they improve it?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4055.069,4072.339,"Well, an answer to Your Honor's question, I would think that if they show that monopoly remains even though A, B and C have been fulfilled, then the result is the Decree has not operated as contemplated."
1967.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4072.737,4075.08,Now that would entitle them to relief.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4075.08,4077.77,"Yeah, it would entitle them to relief."
1967.597,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4083.614,4087.861,"We'll recess now, Mr. Carson."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4087.861,4094.778,-- manner of the erosion that was intended and so stated by Judge Wyzanski in his findings.
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4626.142,4627.213,May I ask you if --
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4627.213,4628.07,"Of course, Justice Black."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4628.07,4639.824,-- if the members of this National Footwear Manufacturer Associaiton is composed of all the competitors --
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4639.824,4646.176,"A substantial number -- a substantial number, Justice Black, a substantial majority."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4646.176,4648.407,"This isn't of competitors, isn't it?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4648.407,4651.561,These are trade associations of shoe manufacturers.
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4651.561,4652.46,These are customers --
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4652.46,4655.511,"Customers, not competitors of United."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4993.036,5005.639,"And if -- I take it that if all the people have an option to buy machine under the Decree had bought them, I suppose there would have been less revenue in ‘63?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5005.639,5007.166,"No, I think it would have been the same Your Honor."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5007.166,5008.999,Is it because these are new leases in this --
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5008.999,5009.514,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5019.924,5030.833,"Yes, but all the machines in ‘63 on which rental was being received where machines which have been leased since the Decree was entered."
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5030.833,5031.845,"Yes, yes."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5048.623,5057.111,"I take it, nevertheless, if people who had -- everyone had a right to buy the machines --"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5057.111,5057.319,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5057.319,5058.027,-- that are on lease.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5058.027,5058.696,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5058.696,5068.998,And if there was transactions among those 63 in that revenues because the buyers had bought because the lessees haven't decided to buy.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5068.998,5078.974,"That is true sir and I should have paid it that as the judge found, not withstanding the opportunity to buy on an equivalent basis."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5154.612,5155.591,May I ask you?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5155.591,5156.189,Of course Mr. Justice Black.
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5156.189,5166.876,It's your view that the so called erosion contemplated by the Decree has now reached the peak --
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5166.876,5167.103,"No, sir."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5167.103,5168.161,-- that was intended?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5168.161,5168.482,"No, sir."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5168.482,5171.305,Or if there are still more erosion to take place?
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5171.305,5173.551,There's more to take place I think inevitably.
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5173.551,5182.862,"Your argument is then, as I see it your difference with the Government, is if they think it should have eroded more up to this time?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5182.862,5183.099,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5183.099,5184.25,You think it should not.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5184.25,5185.365,"Yes , sir."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5185.365,5196.463,"But your view is that if it has eroded, it should have eroded more, they do have a right to challenge the Decree, is that it?"
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5196.463,5201.249,"Well, Your Honors could find that it should have eroded more -- yes."
1967.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5202.824,5204.153,That's what I gathered.
1967.597,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,5204.153,5206.271,"Yes, and I don't see how you can't find that."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6081.139,6085.084,I would be happy to Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6260.677,6266.562,"Mr. Turner, you said all the time if given the opportunity, you'd show this and that and the other."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6279.652,6293.969,"As Mr. Carson said, we had full opportunity to present evidence on the issue of whether there was or was not now workable competition in this market."
1967.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6316.191,6318.684,And that is what you seek in this litigation.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6318.684,6319.45,That is correct.
1967.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6319.45,6322.779,Because your complaint was dismissed.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6322.779,6324.86,Because our petition for modification was dismissed.
1967.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6324.86,6325.656,Yes.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6325.656,6327.557,That is correct.
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6327.557,6361.46,"Well, that would really leads me confused because on your principal argument, I thought you said to me that the question before us was one of the standard to be applied to the issue as to whether the Government is entitled to reopen the Decree but now you tended all the evidence on the question of whether the Decree had failed to achieve the intended result, is that fair?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6361.46,6362.083,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6362.083,6375.646,And the judge decided or did the judge decide that you had failed to prove that the Decree failed to -- that the Decree had not achieved its intended result?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6375.646,6375.926,Yes.
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6464.91,6483.582,Well are you saying -- is it your position that the erosion didn't go fast enough or that the Decree and was intended to operate like a boat from blue and eliminate the bad situation in one stroke or.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6483.582,6483.849,No.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6523.991,6526.676,Ten years is long enough to do what?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6526.676,6530.299,To dissipate on that -- effectively dissipate monopoly power.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6530.299,6534.298,Now what does 62% have to do with that?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6534.298,6570.719,We would urge Mr. Justice Black that any company with 62% of the market with competitors no one of which is larger than 9% can fairly and accurately be described as a dominant company almost certainly having exclusionary power and at least some lines in this market and the judge himself said that United's share in major machinery lines is far higher than it was in minor machines that this is a situation in which workable competition is plain enough in a store.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6570.719,6574.585,Is it your goal to get rid of the entire 62%?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6574.585,6575.127,"No, sir."
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6600.9,6603.113,Can you say they have no competitor now?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6603.113,6603.575,"No, sir."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6654.878,6676.341,And if you would suggest -- you would not suggest that the previous proceedings in this case that if you found -- if in the first instance found United with 62% and its nearest competitor is 7% or 8% or 9% that you could successfully urge with United be dissolved or separated.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6676.341,6683.439,I would -- that was -- I'm afraid I did leave this a little unfair and I intended to come back to Mr. Justice White.
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6724.893,6726.718,Even though admittedly not now offering --
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6726.718,6727.88,"Oh, yes."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6732.111,6732.632,Was acquired.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6732.632,6759.781,"Is -- was acquired maintained by a lot of practices and is at least in part what they now have is equivocal to that and that is why even though we could not now bring a monopolization case, even though we now assume they have an interim committed no unlawful practices that the original function of the Decree has not been achieved and surely, it is in the public interest to correct the situation like that."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6759.781,6769.67,Are there -- are there any mergers who put in the -- among the competitors of United or you take it in view of that?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6769.67,6774.707,"I will -- I think that I will make a safe answer, I know of none."
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6774.707,6776.907,"Mr. Turner, may I ask you."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6798.819,6807.006,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I -- we have of course argued that he did not construe his original Decree accurately."
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6840.396,6854.351,"Well now then, if we may proceed on the premise that he did or at least at his interpretation of what he made at that time was not an unreasonable one that is expressed today."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6871.678,6899.228,"Well, actually, the hardest case you could put to me is suppose that what he currently interprets his Decree as a meaning was perfectly obvious to everybody concerned at the time and then it may well -- the Government would certainly be open to criticism if nothing else for not having appeal on the ground that that was not a Decree that would go far enough."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6901.568,6905.493,And the government -- the government would then certainly be a subject to some heavier burdens of the --
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6905.493,6905.697,Well --
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6905.697,6906.994,-- proceedings such as Swift.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6906.994,6925.642,"-- whether it would or not Mr. Justice White, I think it depends on how important you place the public interest in an effective Antitrust Decree as compared to some kinds of considerations that you ordinarily take into account -- among private parties."
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6925.735,6927.101,"Well, I'm trying to get back too Mr. Turner."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6927.101,6927.349,What I --
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6927.349,6942.959,"There's a question from the Chief Justice earlier, you said several time, you felt the Government was improperly denied a hearing like other hearing in the sense has two kinds isn't it."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6942.959,6943.113,"Yes, sir."
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6943.113,6950.997,"There's one -- certainly, you had some kind of burden before you're entitled to be heard on alternative remedies."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6952.172,6952.511,Yes.
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6960.659,6961.131,Yes.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6972.665,6973.359,That's correct sir.
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6973.359,6978.658,"And so that really on the merits of that issue Judge Wyzanski decided the merits against you, did he?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6978.658,6979.382,"No, he did not."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6979.382,6979.826,"No, he did not?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,6979.826,6988.7,"Now you see, again, his findings must be taken in the light of the test of the question that he raised."
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7017.356,7020.015,But where do you get that standard?
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7027.328,7029.655,"Obviously so, except I can only suggest you that I would --"
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7029.655,7031.889,"Well, I'll come back to the question, is the government asking us now?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7031.889,7034.254,I can only suggest the possibility --
1967.597,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7034.254,7044.794,"Now, was the Government asking us now to go back and decide whether Judge Wyzanski was right or wrong in the way that he interpreted what he intended at the end of the original Decree?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7044.794,7048.563,"I don't think that's necessary, no."
1967.597,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7048.563,7049.193,But you just --
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7049.193,7056.237,"Mr. Turner, I have a great difficulty with this."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7093.199,7094.856,Yes.
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7094.856,7132.735,"Now, he says that the government urges that even though United complied with the Decree and everything worked as it was intended, the result was not achieved to which the A, B and C were directed namely, the elimination or the break up of monopoly power and Judge Wyzanski said that the latter whether a Decree achieved that objective of breaking up monopoly power is not a matter upon which the government can now get relief."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7148.667,7149.166,"Well, I --"
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7149.166,7160.353,"Now, you're saying something very different and that's what creating my difficulty and if it is something in his opinion that supports your construction of it and I'd sure like to see it."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7160.353,7174.822,"Well, in the first place, this paragraph that you referred to in Appendix 82 when he says, what the government is complaining off is not that the Decree did not worked as expected."
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7233.705,7253.892,"But Judge Wyzanski says very plainly and perhaps very bluntly, the Government is now coming in and saying that a Decree that was entered in 1953 was not well calculated or was not adequately calculated to break -- to achieve a break up of monopoly power."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7261.701,7261.837,That does --
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7261.837,7264.081,And you say it is a subject as to which the Decree can be --
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7264.081,7266.328,"Well, I would state references a little bit."
1967.597,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7266.328,7270.108,-- and if that's that issue I can understand that.
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7273.449,7279.026,"Your Honor, I'm very sorry if I confused you."
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7279.026,7279.462,Suppose --
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7279.462,7293.255,We are indeed saying that whether the Decree was well conceived in its inception or not a material failure in the Decree makes it appropriate to at least look at other relief -- that we are saying.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7293.255,7307.767,"Suppose Mr. Turner, instead of having gone down to as much as you did the monopoly power had increased to 50% during the first ten years."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7328.487,7330.606,I don't think he can Mr. Justice Black.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7330.606,7333.053,"That's what you're arguing here, isn't it?"
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7333.053,7333.62,That's right.
1967.597,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7333.62,7351.736,"That you have a right to change this, ask it to be modified if there has been a failure to accomplish what the suit was about, namely to destroy the monopoly power."
1967.597,2,21634,donald_f_turner,,7351.736,7355.102,That's correct Mr. Justice Black.
1967.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7357.372,7362.608,Very well.
