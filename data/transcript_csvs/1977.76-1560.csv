1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,62.316,65.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.404,116.222,"When you say the principle question presented, you mean the questions presented by the petition for certiorari?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,116.222,118.384,"By -- by our petition, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.384,118.387,Yes.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,118.387,122.069,"That's the main issue, that's the main focus in this Court and the reason perhaps --"
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.069,134.186,"Well, you say, “The main focus in this Court,” don't you have a feeling that this had been a dire act case the Third Circuit would have affirmed on the basis of harmless error with an instruction like it?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,134.186,139.457,"I -- I would -- I don't know, Mr. Justice, but let me explain the reason I say it's the principle case."
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.478,421.728,"If that's all the record showed, what would be your position?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,421.728,436.697,"Just -- if that -- if that's all you had -- well, we would say that the verification alone, verification alone in the circumstances of this -- well, if that's all they did, if all they were doing was verifying, if that's all that were shown that would not, in our view, be a violation of Section --"
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.697,438.81,I'm not verifying in the meeting --
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,438.81,439.125,And then that would --
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.125,439.898,-- the grass cutter.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,439.898,443.099,-- meeting -- meeting would be -- that would begin to get more.
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.099,446.514,"Begin, but would it be occurring?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,446.514,465.582,"I -- I couldn't state without knowing more fact, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, but, and this we think is the critical thing in this case, the charge was and the jury by its verdict must have found that verification if done with either the purpose or the effect of fixing prices would be enough to violate the Sherman Act."
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.647,648.746,"Mr. Friedman, what -- what part of the instruction is this part of your argument devoted to?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,652.756,666.981,"No, it's -- it's devoted to the -- the basic question of whether a -- an agreement of price exchange agreement that has the effect of fixing or stabilizing prices may be justified because of a purpose to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act."
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.26,690.724,The Court of Appeals didn't hold.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,694.374,695.113,No.
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,721.875,726.379,"Mr. Friedman, what -- what is the theory of the alleged conspiracy?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,726.379,734.925,From the beginning -- prior to 1960 until the return of the indictment in December 1973.
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,734.925,737.715,"You have a statute of limitations that operate somewhere in there, don't you?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,737.715,737.992,Yes.
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,743.186,743.839,68?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,743.839,745.503,68.
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,745.503,760.104,"My impressions from your statement of facts, which I think it's about 45 pages long, is that most of the facts you talked about occurred before the period involved in the indictment."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,760.104,762.588,"Most -- most of them did, Mr. Justice."
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,791.83,799.795,"The -- the application practice after 1968 was at a very substantially low level, as I gathered from --"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,799.795,802.622,That -- that is -- that is undoubtedly correct.
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.262,944.228,Why is this -- are those the same instructions on page 13 (a) of the petition?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,952.863,953.32,"Well, no."
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.896,1031.63,"So, you're picking out a part of the instructions that the Third Circuit didn't really deal with that's less favorable to the Government and saying -- or that's more than the instructions, more favorable to the Government and arguing that that should be sustained here."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1031.63,1032.02,"Well, no."
1977.76-1560,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1067.379,1074.023,"Of course the trial judge's instructions also said that, “If the sole purpose was good faith in compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act, there's no violation.”"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1074.023,1074.839,No.
1977.76-1560,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1113.091,1129.171,"Well, his first instruction says, “If you decide, this on 1721, that if this was merely done in a good faith effort to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, then you could not consider verification standing alone as establishing an agreement to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize prices as charged.”"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1136.831,1137.227,"Well, no."
1977.76-1560,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.622,1141.233,Right.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1141.233,1142.641,“--as establishing an agreement.”
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1160.198,1175.883,"And you think that's to be understood as the instruction of the jury, “Even if the sole purpose of the verification was to establish in this defense under Robinson-Patman Act, if indeed the effect of it was,” then there was (Voice Overlap)."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1175.883,1176.708,That's -- that's correct.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.772,1181.393,"Although, he left that -- he left that out of that sentence that you read."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1181.393,1181.398,"Well, it's not --"
1977.76-1560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.398,1183.491,"Well, there should be evidence in that paragraph."
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.242,1185.442,Right.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1185.442,1189.816,"No, like the jury could infer of what -- could find a violation if --"
1977.76-1560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.816,1194.571,"Well, you're -- it's all right if you want to read it, you're reading it on paper with your opponents in that actual language."
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1194.571,1195.857,Yes.
1977.76-1560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.857,1205.958,Did it surprise you that the jurors were taking pills after delivering for four days under (Voice Overlap)?
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.958,1207.73,"Luckily, we're only going to be here for an hour."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1207.73,1210.81,"Yes, it doesn't surprise me."
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.435,1226.321,"It was even more extravagant than that that the foreman of the jury reported to the Court here that literally, some of the jurors were ready to jump out the window."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1226.321,1227.99,"Well, I think -- I think --"
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1227.99,1229.776,Do you think that was a little hyperbole?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1229.776,1230.391,I think so.
1977.76-1560,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.923,1243.51,Maybe he was just trying to walk.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1243.51,1249.729,"Well, that's not -- that's not unusual, Mr. Justice, with a long case and a complicated, difficult case."
1977.76-1560,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.729,1250.646,Well then tell me.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1250.646,1255.543,"Lot of facts, seven defendants, you have to evaluate the evidence against each of them."
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1327.753,1331.184,And do you read Container as being unanimous in that -- in that respect?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1331.184,1346.327,"I do -- I do, Mr. Justice, because the dissenting opinion in Container specifically refers two or three times, it said they did not think in this case -- in that case, the Government had established either the purpose or the intent to stabilize fixed prices."
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.709,1347.682,Or -- or effect.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1347.682,1348.243,Or effects.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.539,1593.154,"Well, wasn't there was an also -- wasn't there the same -- assertively the same controlling circumstances -- circumstance as in Cement, i.e.to protect against customer fraud?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1593.154,1597.493,"Well, that, we think is a different type of customer fraud, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.493,1606.145,Here was the assertion is that it was to protect against being misinformed by a customer that a -- that a competitor had given him a lower price.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1606.145,1607.23,"Yes, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1607.23,1608.916,What -- what was the customer fraud in Cement?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1608.916,1620.876,"In Cement, the customer fraud was they had an arrangement whereby they would permit people to get a product at a lower price during the duration where they were going to increase the price --"
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.876,1622.057,"Oh, during that protection period, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1622.057,1622.253,Protection.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1622.253,1623.333,And they had over (Voice Overlap)
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1623.333,1631.831,And -- and the purpose of the exchange in Cement was to enable a firm to be protected against having to ship.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1672.399,1673.98,"Well, they have the fact doctrine then."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1673.98,1675.449,What?
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1675.449,1682.87,It's not unusual experience for any member of this Court to casually use a phrase in an opinion and then it comes back a year or two later as a doctrine.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1682.87,1683.421,That's right.
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.603,1687.172,"Or -- or a test, or a test."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1687.172,1687.591,Test.
1977.76-1560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.167,1873.162,"Mr. Friedman, before you leave this aspect of the case, in Judge Hunter's opinion at pages 28 and 29 of the cert petition, he summarizes what he thinks would be a proper instruction which was not quite given."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1876.398,1881.676,"Yes, yes, we would say that instruction, that's what we're challenging that instruction."
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1922.07,1936.48,"Mr. Friedman, before you go on, if there is verification of practice widely was in this case and it does not result in stabilizing prices, I take it you wouldn't complain of that?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1936.48,1936.833,No.
1977.76-1560,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1961.007,1971.555,"In -- in an industry like this one, where as you stated at the outset, the price is stabilized because of the nature of the commodity and the -- and the nature of the industry."
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.836,1975.125,It's the price.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,1975.125,1983.191,"Well, the -- it's stabilized through list prices, but what that trying to do is prevent and eliminate the discounting."
1977.76-1560,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2010.001,2012.379,You are now saying you would not check with the -- with your --
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2012.379,2012.909,What?
1977.76-1560,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2012.909,2015.094,You are now saying you would not check with your --

1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2015.951,2016.259,No.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.266,2036.961,What if -- Mr. Friedman and I want to be sure I understood your answer to my Brother Powell's question.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2059.009,2063.967,That -- that would be a violation if there was an agreement and if the purpose was to stabilize prices.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.967,2065.239,Even though wholly unsuccessful?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2065.239,2066.391,Even though wholly unsuccessful.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.391,2067.625,"It would still be a violation, wouldn't it?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2067.625,2068.15,It would still be a violation.
1977.76-1560,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.15,2070.072,Well then I misunderstood your answer to my Brother Powell's question.
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2070.072,2071.007,"Sorry, I --"
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.007,2081.56,"Mr. Friedman, why shouldn't there -- why shouldn't the significance of the effect on prices be merely evidence of an agreement to affect prices?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2081.56,2082.197,"Well, it is."
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.59,2094.054,"Well, should the -- should the jury -- must not the jury have to conclude that there is a conspiracy or agreement to set prices or to affect prices?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2094.054,2095.134,"Oh yes, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.134,2096.077,"Now, you agree with that?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2096.077,2097.393,"Yes, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.393,2110.216,And that the -- and that the -- so that the whole function of proving effect would be to lead the jury to conclude that there is a conspiracy to --?
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2110.216,2110.844,"Yes, yes."
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.844,2111.142,Does that --
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2111.142,2113.317,There has to be -- there has to be two things.
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.711,2152.42,"Well, just the bare statement of the Government's position and even the bare statement that you can get on Container, both the majority and the dissent would indicate that if you just have an agreement to exchange price information and you have the effect of -- and you had -- it has an effect on prices that there is -- a violation has been proved."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2152.42,2153.85,I -- I would think -- think if --
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.85,2169.532,"Well, I know, but you should go through the litany and say if -- if there is an agreement is to exchange price information and then there is an effect on prices, do you say then as a matter of law, it must be concluded that there is an agreement to set, to fix prices?"
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2169.532,2170.176,No.
1977.76-1560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.913,2179.744,"But whichever way you put it, if there is more to it and just -- just saying that you have to have an agreement."
1977.76-1560,0,23500,friedman,,2179.744,2202.228,"Yes, there is more to it, but the reason I am putting it in these terms is because of the -- what we think is the error of the Court of Appeals holding that without regard to the effect on prices or what the agreement was, if the purpose was merely to offer a defense under the Robinson-Patman Act, then that would be sufficient to justify the practice."
1977.76-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.33,2212.588,Very well.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2214.152,2229.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am going to deal with the Robinson-Patman verification point as described by Mr. Friedman including retroactivity."
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.49,2307.642,Yes.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2325.355,2325.76,Well --
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.76,2329.856,"And if there is a conspiracy to set prices, it's purposeful."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2329.856,2340.647,"If there is, Mr. Justice White, a conspiracy, a direct agreement, so to speak, to fix prices, he doesn't need to show the effect."
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.973,2376.272,"Well, would you say -- would you say that it would be -- that a jury verdict -- if a jury is told that you must find a conspiracy to set prices, which means purposeful agreement, if you must find that but then it is instructed that you may but you need not find it, if you find an agreement to exchange information plus an effect upon prices, now was that --?"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2376.272,2376.602,The jury --
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.602,2384.16,"If a jury comes -- if a jury then finds the defendant's guilty, would you say that as a -- should be upset?"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2384.16,2397.877,"Mr. Justice White, if the jury has the option so that it could have found the defendant guilty on the basis of merely an exchange of prices and price stability, that is error."
1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.625,2408.213,You say they can't even use it as you know basis for inference.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2408.213,2428.38,"No, they could use price stability as a basis of an inference but they must find -- they could infer a purpose which is what I think this Court did in the Container Case from price stability in an exchange of pricing information."
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.38,2437.215,So you -- you say those two facts aren't enough to infer from which a jury could infer a conspiracy to set prices?
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2437.215,2453.527,"Mr. Justice White, exactly and that's the central point of this verification issue and this case, that's what -- we don't know what the jury found and the Government shouldn't be talking about what it proved."
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.31,2466.165,"We don't think the jury here was instructed that find the defendant is guilty if they found an effect on prices, will you?"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2466.165,2483.593,"All right, Mr. Justice White, I am confident that the jury here was absolutely instructed if they found an exchange of price information and price stability, they must find that that would be a violation of the Sherman Act --"
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.593,2485.78,Must or may?
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2485.78,2489.175,-- that they could find on that basis.
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.175,2491.018,"Yes, that is may?"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2491.018,2492.48,"Yes, that is may."
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.48,2495.892,"Well, I wanted -- were they required to find it or not?"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2495.892,2517.84,"They were not required, they were -- but they were not -- they were told to disregard purpose entirely and if I may quote to the instructions and quoting from page 17, 20 -- 22 of the record which is a little but in the charge after."
1977.76-1560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.617,2555.911,There's one thing you omit though.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2560.711,2565.727,"All right, an agreement to exchange the information and it seems to me --"
1977.76-1560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.727,2570.75,He says if there is that plus the effect then they can infer purpose.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2570.75,2576.26,"Yes, he -- he instructed -- no, he says, regardless of the purpose, Your Honor."
1977.76-1560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.414,2585.104,Let's read the whole paragraph.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2607.303,2616.683,He's talking though only about an agreement to exchange prices but not an agreement to fix prices.
1977.76-1560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.683,2626.076,"But it's the agreement -- with the question, as I understand, is whether the agreement to exchange prices which had an adverse effect on the price level is enough to prove a violation."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2626.959,2646.385,"Mr. Justice Stevens in -- in which relates back to the exchange of prices, I don't -- I don't -- it's the exchange of price information which has the stabilizing effect whether they exchanged with an agreement or not, if they exchange --"
1977.76-1560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.385,2650.949,This is the -- this is the paragraph you contempt as erroneous.
1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.141,2653.867,That's not the one that Judge Hunter relied on.
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.867,2657.037,The last (Voice Overlap)--
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2657.037,2658.375,Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.375,2660.729,They'd left off the five words.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2665.069,2666.175,"I'm sorry, I don't understand that Mr. Chief --"
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2666.175,2671.88,Well the last five or six words that Mr. Justice Stevens has just read to you from that instruction.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2672.098,2672.989,"Well, I would --"
1977.76-1560,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2672.989,2676.817,"Oh I beg your pardon, to your question as well there's a kind of law."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.817,2678.063,About purpose.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2678.063,2684.641,"The Act does not require a specific purpose to restrain trade, that's -- that's the error."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.469,2689.795,Might have been or would have been?
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2689.795,2690.054,Yes.
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2690.054,2692.414,Would you be attacking it if he'd left --?
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2692.414,2706.839,"Well, if he said earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, regardless of the specific purpose, I would still be attacking it because -- because I must read the whole -- the whole thing because that's what the jury heard, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.757,2813.896,"Could you look at the third paragraph of the instruction of the petitioner on page 13 (a), which is a part of the Court of Appeals opinion beginning, “However, if you decide that the effect to the exchanges was to raise, fix, maintain, and stabilize the price of gypsum wallboard, then you may consider these exchanges as evidence of the mutual agreement or understanding alleged in the indictment to raise, fix, maintain, and stabilize list prices.”"
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2823.107,2825.487,I think they may consider it.
1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2826.385,2828.814,But Judge Hunter said they couldn't.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2835.24,2850.375,"Well, I think what the Court of Appeals found to be erroneous was the omission from the charge of the necessary element of purpose in the exchange of price information."
1977.76-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.752,2869.153,"Well, the instruction that which my Brother Rehnquist has just referred to, told the jury that they could infer a purpose from the exchange and from the effect of the exchange if the effect was to stabilize prices, then they could infer a purpose."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2872.607,2873.842,I think if -- yes.
1977.76-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2894.301,2895.439,Yes.
1977.76-1560,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.439,2921.452,"So you wouldn't -- if the jury were properly instructed that they must find a purposeful agreement to set prices and then said, but you may, but you didn't infer such an -- no legal conspiracy from an agreement to exchange prices plus stability and the jury came back with a verdict and that's all the facts there were."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2928.251,2938.059,I think the jury should be told you have to find purpose in an exchange of price information in order to -- in order -- in a price --

1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2938.83,2953.866,-- information exchange -- I think that I would object to that and find that reversible and certainly in a criminal case where purpose is such a vital element and especially if we are going into felony cases.
1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2953.866,2958.927,Are you assuming you're turning it for the Government or for the defendant?

1977.76-1560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.341,2970.166,But you're -- you're saying that a charge for the judges you may infer and you're saying the charge should be you must infer.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2970.166,2970.171,"Well, no."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.171,2972.198,I didn't -- I didn't understand you dissent.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2972.198,2972.2,He could find --
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2972.2,2976.325,(Voice Overlap) they must find a purpose.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2976.325,2977.685,They must find purpose.
1977.76-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.685,2980.553,Must find purpose and they may infer it from the certain --
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2980.553,2983.634,They may infer it from all the circumstances.
1977.76-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.634,2989.182,But you insist that the jury must be instructed that they must find a purpose to stabilize prices.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2989.182,2989.864,That's correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1977.76-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.864,2992.474,And you further insist that there was no such instruction in this case.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,2992.474,3025.824,"That's -- that's my position and I say that -- that this has been the law for 50 -- 50 years starting with -- in 1925 of Maple Flooring and Cement Manufacturers which were both, although civil, purpose cases and Cement Manufacturers, of course, also had in it the element of the -- of custom of fraud with respect to the job protection plan."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.994,3234.804,"And you've emphasized very -- very properly that this is a criminal felony case as suppose to take an analogy that maybe farfetched the -- in a charge for the felony of assault with intent to kill, the jury was instructed to -- to try to make it parallel to this instruction that if you find that the defendant had a gun on his hand, that he knew it was loaded, that he cock the gun and pointed it at the victim and pulled the trigger, you may infer an intent to commit the crime charged in the indictment."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,3236.913,3244.859,"I think -- I think you -- Mr. Chief Justice, you -- thus, you may infer it from these circumstances but you must infer it to convict him."
1977.76-1560,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3244.859,3246.55,"Well, you -- you must find it."
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,3247.747,3249.093,You must find it -- find it whether you infer it.
1977.76-1560,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3249.093,3249.954,You may refer it for --
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,3249.954,3256.368,"You may use these circumstances for such an inference but whatever basis, you must find it to convict the man."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3256.368,3260.525,(Inaudible) a little bit to make it restricted parallel.
1977.76-1560,1,45656,w_donald_mcsweeney,,3273.816,3276.886,"Consider those circumstances, they must find the purpose."
1977.76-1560,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.264,3423.059,"Very well, Mr. McSweeney."

1977.76-1560,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.014,3440.187,I took it that it should not be applied retroactively.

1977.76-1560,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3953.419,3963.242,Are you suggesting that at that stage it might be something like a class action or a problem of identifying who was a member of the class of the conspiracy?
1977.76-1560,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,3963.242,3989.142,"On the bill of particulars here, I think we did have problems of identifying who were the members, but in any event, sir, I think that it's perfectly clear from the decided cases of this Court and the lower courts that just as you can infer participation in a conspiracy, you can infer withdrawal so long as the conduct which indicates withdrawal is known to the others allegedly involved in the conspiracy --"

1977.76-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4148.944,4153.76,And then they -- and then they make the point that the -- that counsel were allowed to argue this to the jury.

1977.76-1560,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4662.131,4679.017,"Do you think there is a problem of the judge telling that to one member of the jury, that is the foreman with his special status of authority and depending upon that individual to carry the message back accurately and faithfully to the other 11?"
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4679.017,4684.076,"I think there's a problem, Your Honor, whenever there's a private meeting between the judge and one member of the jury."
1977.76-1560,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4706.135,4708.86,"Mr. Bartlit, before you sit down, you consented to the private meeting."
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4713.245,4713.91,"No, sir."
1977.76-1560,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4717.71,4719.201,Did you know in advance there would be a transcript?
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4719.201,4719.621,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1560,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4719.621,4720.078,You did?
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4720.58,4725.177,We feel that the voice of the meeting was not that it was private because I consented to that.
1977.76-1560,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4725.177,4725.291,Right.
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4725.291,4726.406,I consent to it again.
1977.76-1560,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4740.81,4746.664,Am I correct You got access to that transcript only by requesting it from the Court of Appeals after you filed your Notice of Appeal.
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4746.785,4748.81,"Yes, sir, that's right."
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4748.81,4767.064,"Mr. Bartlit, you mentioned right at the clause of your remarks that the names of Mr. Colon Brown and Mr. J.P. Nicely on whose behalf a separate brief has been field here and who make quite a separate kind of an argument including among other things, the double jeopardy clause."
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4785.091,4785.855,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4785.855,4787.889,Nobody has early represented them here?
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4787.889,4788.354,"No, sir."
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4795.779,4798.112,Do you represent Mr. Brown and Mr. Nicely?
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4798.112,4800.384,"I represent only Andrew Watt, Your Honor."
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4800.384,4800.587,"Now, is the --"
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4800.587,4809.634,I undertook to the extent that the instructional errors and the jury coercion bore on the rights of those two individuals' honest appeal I undertook to.
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4809.634,4811.017,You have a community of interest.
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4811.017,4811.445,That's right.
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4811.445,4814.13,But they also have seemed to make -- be making a separate argument.
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4817.876,4820.949,That's my understanding.

1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4824.253,4825.772,-- on a sufficiency point is still pending.
1977.76-1560,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4828.137,4828.684,Right.
1977.76-1560,3,23608,fred_h_bartlit_jr,,4828.684,4830.801,Thank you.
1977.76-1560,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4830.801,4834.054,Mr. Friedman.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4834.054,4851.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, the final words that the judge gave to the juror at this meeting he had with him at page 80 and 140 is you tell them to keep deliberating and see if they can come to a verdict."
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4853.518,4857.375,But then I'll put to you the question that I had put to your friend.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4870.554,4875.959,"Well, we don't know specifically of course what the judge --"
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4875.959,4876.678,We can assume.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4879.594,4880.372,That's right.
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4946.059,4949.609,None of us in this room know what he told the jury.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4949.609,4951.329,That -- that is correct.
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4951.329,4952.991,But isn't that a problem?
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4952.991,4980.253,"I -- I don't think so -- I don't think so, Mr. Justice, because before, before it should be held that a jury has been coerced, it seems to me we need something more than this dialog where the foreman had again request to the judge saying the verdict of the jury is a hung jury and we like -- we think we've had enough of this and the judge said, “I want you to go back,” he said at 1839, “I want you to go back and deliberate again."""
1977.76-1560,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4980.71,4987.175,"In any event, of all these practices, maybe very dubious and front with all sorts of risks."
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,4988.733,4989.843,Oh yes.
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5014.737,5018.918,Why -- why didn't he call the whole jury in and tell them his last statement?
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5018.918,5022.679,"Well, because Mr. -- two reasons, Mr. Justice."
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5051.202,5055.172,"Well, it's already to tell -- the foreman to tell."
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5055.172,5056.549,"No, all -- no."
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5059.032,5067.357,"Not that I'm saying that he could then have called the jury in and said, “The foreman has told you this and I want to tell you, this is what I have to say.”"
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5067.357,5068.577,"Well, he could have done that --"
1977.76-1560,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5068.577,5073.96,Then he at least would have known that the jury got the correct information.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5073.96,5082.499,"He could have done that, but I don't think it was necessary, Mr. Justice, in light of the previous charges, in the light of what was said to him by the foreman."
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5097.83,5115.273,"Well, Mr. Friedman, when the lawyers agreed that he could receive the foreman of the jury, isn't it reasonable that they should thank that he was merely going to listen and not give any additional instructions?"
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5115.273,5115.945,"Well, I --"
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5115.945,5118.222,That's number one and you can address both at once.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5137.718,5137.951,"Well, this --"
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5137.951,5142.533,"Do you think that would -- and if we knew that, wouldn't you think that would taint this verdict?"
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5142.533,5146.312,"That -- that might -- that would -- would well be a serious problem, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5156.293,5172.274,"That would be a certainly strong policy against -- I should think in 40 some years, I've never heard of a judge visiting with one member of the jury for anything except the communication of the message by the jury to the judge."
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5172.274,5173.141,"Well, but --"
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5173.141,5174.644,And that's a very high policy.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5174.644,5177.871,"That is -- that is quite true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1560,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5212.103,5212.755,Mr. Friedman.
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5212.755,5212.759,-- and they came --
1977.76-1560,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5212.759,5215.436,"And when they consented, what options did the judge give them?"
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5216.908,5223.452,"The option was that either they would consent or he would tell the juror or the foreman, “No, I will not meet with you.”"
1977.76-1560,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5254.351,5256.148,Rather they're not talking to him at all?
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5256.148,5256.922,Yes.
1977.76-1560,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5256.922,5268.956,"Mr. Friedman, I noticed the Government doesn't urge what -- I kept thought it usual to urge in criminal cases that the instruction should be considered as a whole and no one singled out."
1977.76-1560,4,23500,friedman,,5273.134,5273.995,"No, no."
1977.76-1560,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5309.89,5310.62,"Thank you, gentlemen."
