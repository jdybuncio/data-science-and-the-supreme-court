1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-2051, South Dakota v. Gregg Bourland."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,69.394,74.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.416,159.052,But what used to... did it used to be part of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,159.052,174.68,"--Yes, it did, Your Honor, and the... I should say the eastern boundary of the reservation jutted out into the mid-channel, quote, unquote, of the river, and that reservation boundary is still there at this time out into the water somewhere."
1992.91-2051,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.199,183.685,Does that mean... just so I... does that mean that the area in dispute is now within the reservation?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,183.685,191.439,"--There is... the issue... we have not brought the issue before the Court today of diminishment, and--"
1992.91-2051,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.439,195.343,"You haven't brought it here, but it was decided below that there was no diminishment."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,195.343,195.76,--That's--
1992.91-2051,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.76,196.677,There's no appeal.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,202.314,204.349,"--I think that's a fair statement, Your Honor."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.224,258.067,Is that a checkerboard situation on the reservation where the holdings of fee land and reservation are kind of like a checkerboard?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,258.067,259.934,It is interspersed.
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.661,309.682,"So, does this case involve the... any of the fee land except the area taken by the United States?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,309.682,310.801,--It does not anymore.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.836,368.055,"How does that bear on the legal issues involved in this case, General Barnett?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,368.055,389.534,"The tribe has... for a period of some 30 years, Your Honor, the State of South Dakota has vigorously managed all of this public property and assumed jurisdiction over all of this area, both the take land, whether it was previously Indian land or whether it was previously fee land by non-Indians, as well as all the waters."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.938,403.478,But does that bear because of some statute or some case from this Court?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,410.382,421.523,I think that it is the most compelling evidence of how all of the parties to this entire transaction have construed the '54 act.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.65,540.683,"General Barnett, am I correct that you have taken or you have represented to us that the only regulation to which the State has consented in the past, basically by agreement I guess, has been regulation of Indians on the reservation lands, as distinguished from nontribal members?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,540.683,556.311,"We have conceded and we do concede today that the tribe is in charge of game problems, game management, and so forth even as to nonmembers on tribal trust lands, the lands that they still have the power to exclude from."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.635,754.657,"General Barnett, they could have had... thought they had jurisdiction before, but simply decided that, as a matter of comity, they would honor the State hunting license."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,754.657,774.737,--I think that the best evidence of what the tribe thought was the fact that for some 30 years they had not made any actual... they had had a regulation in I believe the '30's under the Indian Reorganization Act that suggested or that they claimed gave them jurisdiction over these nonmember activities.
1992.91-2051,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.25,805.106,"General Barnett, where does the State acquire the authority to issue hunting licenses for this land?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,805.106,829.889,"I would submit first under Rosebud v. Kneip, the principle that this Court suggested, another case coming out of South Dakota, that when the State has exercised jurisdiction for so many years, without objection through those years from the Government or the tribe, that this can create jurisdictional expectations and that it also is good evidence of how the parties construe the law."
1992.91-2051,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.889,843.148,Could the Corps of Engineer... Corps of Engineers say anybody can hunt and fish without a State license or we'll issue a Corps of Engineers licence instead?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,843.148,852.754,"I would submit that the... there isn't any question that the Federal Government has the right to regulate this property, and probably the answer to that question is yes."
1992.91-2051,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.491,872.585,"Well, I thought maybe your authority came from the Corps' regulations which say that all other Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remain in full force and effect, where applicable, to these water resource development projects."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,872.585,887.16,"I think that's an additional source, and I think a source even earlier than that is section 4 of the '44 act, which made it clear this was to be opened up to the public for boating, recreation, fishing, and so forth."
1992.91-2051,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.16,893.998,"Oh, I have no doubt about that, but I just wonder whether... you know, why it is that the State gets the right to exclude anybody--"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,893.998,895.35,I think there's also--
1992.91-2051,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.35,895.65,--Federal land.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,895.65,907.658,"--a principle that runs through the cases of this Court that the powers not exercised by the Federal Government, and particularly with regard to navigable waterways, are reserved to the State."
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.658,918.715,"Well, I thought you thought that the analysis in Montana would... in the Montana case would control this case."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,918.715,921.833,"I would submit that that is the case, Your Honor."
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.833,924.433,And the court below thought otherwise.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,924.433,926.135,The court below thought otherwise.
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.141,947.549,"Well, where did Montana say the State got the authority to regulate on fee land?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,947.549,959.273,"--I think it was a recognition of the concept that jurisdiction over these waterways, to the extent not used by the Federal Government, should remain in the States."
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.652,988.276,Is it clear and conceded by everyone that this property that the United States took is open to the public?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,988.276,993.03,"I don't think there's any dispute about that, Your Honor, although perhaps the other side would--"
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.03,1008.206,"So, even though it's in the... inside the reservation, do... does the public have a right to come and go to that property despite what the tribe wants to do?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1011.158,1011.775,--We--
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.775,1013.177,--entirely from this property?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1013.177,1020.831,"--We contend that they can neither exclude from this property nor regulate the nonmembers that come on this property, and that is what the Montana--"
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.831,1022.616,"Well, let's just stick with exclusion."
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1023.549,1025.234,"--No, they cannot."
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.234,1027.417,--Have they claimed that they can?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1027.417,1034.905,"There was testimony by the tribal chairman that, yes, if they wanted to, they could exclude nonmembers from this public property."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.73,1050.431,"What's the shape of the property, General Barnett?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1054.651,1064.257,"It is... the river is, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, 2.16 miles wide on average, and something over 200 miles long."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.815,1079.784,You say... you said that the river is 2.16 miles wide.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1082.236,1082.736,Yes.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.808,1098.68,"So, we're talking about duck hunting or... I mean, are we talking about hunting from dry land or from in the river?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1098.68,1100.314,--All of the above.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.218,1117.909,"How much of a land is there, say, from the regular bank-full level of the river to the edge of the condemned property?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1117.909,1119.694,--I would call it a narrow strip.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.3,1133.585,"So, are we talking about several hundred feet, several hundred yards, a--"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1133.585,1138.639,--It varies anywhere from a couple hundred feet to several hundreds of yards.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.639,1143.376,--And it extends for a long distance along the river channel.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1143.376,1148.88,"All along the edge of the reservation, as I say, some of which was fee land and some of which was not."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.88,1154.617,"But the tribe isn't asserting any claim to regulate hunting on what used to be fee land, is it?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1154.617,1155.501,"Yes, they are."
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.501,1156.117,They are?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1156.117,1157.217,"Yes, they are."
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1158.303,1161.171,Is that claim before us?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1161.171,1162.721,"--Yes, it is."
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.79,1167.909,"That claim was subject to the remand order, wasn't it, below?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1167.909,1168.575,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.575,1169.194,Okay.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1169.194,1183.684,"When I say the fee land, I am referring specifically to the fee land which was fee land before the take, in other words, the non-Indian property that was along that edge of the river that was taken along with the Indians' land along the edge."
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.857,1190.474,Well--
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1190.474,1191.307,--contending jurisdiction.
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.307,1209.185,"--Well, then before the United States took this fee land for this project, the... did the Indians claim authority to regulate the owners of that particular fee land that the Government took?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1209.185,1210.335,They had passed regulations.
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.64,1234.317,"You mean they treated this... the... before... in the time before the project was taken, did the Indian tribe treat the fee land that was taken differently from the fee land in other parts of the reservation?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1234.317,1236.019,Not that I'm aware of.
1992.91-2051,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.471,1259.367,"If the project had never been taken, if the United States had never taken the land, would the Indians today claim that they had the authority to regulate hunting and fishing on the fee land that the Government did take?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1259.367,1262.569,--They're not making that claim as to the fee land.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1305.746,1309.384,Wasn't Montana dealing only with fee land?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1316.204,1317.354,--It... that's correct.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1433.179,1435.281,What... I didn't mean to interrupt you.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1435.281,1440.785,"--And as a consequence of not owning that property and not being able to exclude, they also can't control it."
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.785,1445.339,You mentioned a moment ago the text of the '54 act.
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1458.813,1467.419,The regulatory authority of the tribe stems from its treaty rights under the same identical... basically identical treaty of 1868.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1495.856,1497.772,Do we know that they got it?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1497.772,1498.807,Pardon?
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1498.807,1501.759,Do we know that they got that compensation?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1501.759,1503.125,"Yes, we do."
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.799,1554.308,"Yes, but isn't it one thing to lose wildlife, which you can't take for its economic value, and quite a different thing to lose the authority to exclude others who may, subject to your regulatory authority, come in and hunt and fish for the wildlife?"
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1570.587,1582.977,"--If I understand your question, I would respond that clearly Montana suggested that when that power to exclude is gone, so is the power to regulate."
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.263,1593.019,But does Montana make it clear that that power to exclude is lost with respect to anything other than fee land?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1593.019,1596.054,It was with regard to fee land.
1992.91-2051,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1656.276,1662.079,What were the... did the terms of the ballot refer in any way to the extinction of regulatory rights?
1992.91-2051,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,1662.079,1670.769,--They did not expressly talk about extinction of regulatory power even though no such regulatory power was being asserted at that time.
1992.91-2051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.625,1708.994,"Very well, General Barnett."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1712.362,1713.329,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.329,1715.048,You may proceed.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1715.048,1720.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.577,1762.795,"Again, what issue is it you say that is not before us?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1762.795,1769.616,The issue of whether or not the State has concurrent jurisdiction over the taken areas in question.
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.616,1781.591,"If the State had concurrent jurisdiction, would that mean that the tribe would have to recognize a State hunting license?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1781.591,1784.644,"I'm not sure that it would, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.141,1808.343,Shared jurisdiction between the State and the tribe?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1808.343,1809.193,--In the State and the tribe.
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.876,1813.562,It would not impair the State's--
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1813.562,1815.58,--Wildlife management program.
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.58,1821.651,"--So, that was, in the view of the district court, something that would argue in favor of shared jurisdiction?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1821.651,1832.125,"What was at issue was... when the district court made those findings was, in addition to the... it was reaffirming its decision not to reach the issue of State jurisdiction."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.664,1874.718,Was any part of those findings of the district court reversed by the Eighth Circuit?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1874.718,1875.918,Absolutely none.
1992.91-2051,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.918,1889.411,"Counsel, does the tribe take the position that it has the right to exclude all nontribal members from access to the lake and the adjacent property?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1889.411,1891.594,"No, Justice O'Connor, the tribe does not."
1992.91-2051,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.332,1927.001,"Well, that's a separate question, whether they've actually tried."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1928.519,1929.169,--No.
1992.91-2051,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.169,1931.888,--they want to assert the right to exclude.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1931.888,1932.305,No.
1992.91-2051,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.086,1965.709,"Well, does the tribe assert that it can exclude people from coming through the reservation to reach the area in question?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,1965.709,1979.385,"--Given that this is Federal lands and that one normally understands that there's a right of access to Federal lands, the tribe does not believe it has a right to exclude people to deny them essentially passage across the reservation."
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.545,1999.032,Isn't more than just that general proposition which makes the point?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2018.944,2019.778,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.17,2039.174,"--I assume because it says it shall be, you know, for boating, swimming, bathing, fishing, and other recreational purposes."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2039.174,2051.315,"--Should the Corps of Engineers decide to make that portion of Lake Oahe open for public use, which is an issue in the discretion of the Corps of Engineers, then the tribe does not believe it has the power to exclude people from it."
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.338,2068.193,How can you have the power to license... let's talk about fishing first... when the statute specifically says that they shall be open to public use for fishing?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2068.193,2076.965,"Well, that doesn't... but I don't think that answers the question as to whether or not they shall be free of all fees to license... I mean, to... you know, don't have to pay a license fee to hunt and fish."
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.965,2077.614,I don't understand.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2087.09,2091.292,We do not believe we have the right necessarily to exclude people from the area.
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.047,2101.766,"Well, let's not call it regulate."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2109.17,2111.788,--To require that they have a tribal fishing license.
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.788,2114.424,--And prevent them from fishing if they do not have that license.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2114.424,2115.29,If they do not have the license.
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.74,2120.828,I don't understand why that does not fly directly in the face of that statute.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2120.828,2133.552,"Well, to begin with, section 4 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 is most directly relevant to the 18,000 acres of land within this swatch of territory which was taken from fee simple owners."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.813,2151.38,Taken in fee?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2151.38,2152.949,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.771,2225.162,"But doesn't the tribe claim the right to exclude without a license from the previously fee lands that were taken, the private lands?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2225.162,2226.597,"Yes, it does, Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.597,2231.316,What is the basis for that claim since the Government has taken a fee there?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2231.316,2236.202,"Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the basis for that is precisely because the Government has taken it."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.856,2245.658,"So, why does that give the tribe a right to demand a fishing license on it?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2245.658,2250.629,"Well, the Federal Government ceded to the tribe substantial rights over this entire areas, rights--"
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.629,2254.248,Including the lands taken in fee from the private owners?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2254.248,2255.281,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2051,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.86,2298.877,You mean exclusive rights for grazing?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2298.877,2306.899,"Yes, that was reserved in section, I believe, X of the Flood Control... of the Cheyenne River Act of 1954."
1992.91-2051,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.899,2314.053,But I suppose the United States could always license somebody else to graze under its authority.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2314.053,2321.142,"I'm not sure that that's clear, Justice White, because the statute reserves the right to license and permit to the tribe."
1992.91-2051,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.129,2337.318,"Well, I thought you said a while ago that if the Corps of Engineers wanted to permit people to fish without a tribal license, they could."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2337.318,2337.785,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2366.504,2378.729,"Can I take you back to Justice Scalia's question, and as I understand his question, it doesn't depend, it doesn't implicate any of these reservations of rights that you have been describing here."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2407.081,2413.085,"Well, in every instance, somebody has to regulate the hunting and fishing in these circumstances."
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2419.139,2420.739,"Well, let me ask you."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2456.912,2458.614,"Yes, that is the understanding."
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.614,2466.62,"And so, your claim is that the tribe in this case is doing no more than the States would normally do under their hunting and fishing regulatory authority."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2466.62,2466.986,Yes.
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.931,2488.114,"Okay, but if you just looked--"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2488.114,2488.647,--the fish and game wardens.
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2488.647,2489.097,--Excuse me.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2520.418,2522.62,I think there are two answers to that.
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2538.864,2539.28,Okay.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2539.28,2542.666,It is the understanding of the Federal... and there's also the provision in--
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.666,2544.451,But that won't help you.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2544.451,2549.004,"--Well, that applies with respect to the example that anybody would have authority."
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2562.062,2568.549,"But you have express reservations of grazing rights and timber rights and so on, but you have no express reservation of this regulatory authority."
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2568.549,2572.62,"--There is an express reservation of a right to hunt and fish, which is not exclusive."
1992.91-2051,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.159,2603.389,"Don't you think that's unusual to say, you know, this fee that we've taken is so total... we've taken everything away from you... that we feel we have to give you back the right to hunt and fish, but we don't have to mention anything about your right to continue to govern the land to the extent of excluding other people?"
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2617.082,2619.851,The issue of jurisdiction simply didn't come up.
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2746.299,2748.717,Maybe it was regulatory power over tribal members.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2748.717,2750.069,--I beg your pardon?
1992.91-2051,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2750.069,2753.037,May be it was just regulatory power over tribal members.
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2753.037,2763.21,"That the tribe would... council would have in any event by virtue of the Indian Reorganization Act and the tribal constitution, and that would have been, again, an unnecessary reservation of right."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.71,2842.912,Why did the tribe do nothing for 30 years if it had these concerns?
1992.91-2051,1,17775,brian_stuart_koukoutchos,,2842.912,2845.697,"In fact, Mr. Chief Justice, the tribe did not do nothing."
1992.91-2051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.815,2927.351,"Thank you, Mr. Koukoutchos."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2930.184,2936.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2051,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.866,2980.651,Like what?
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2980.651,2984.02,"Like swimming, picnicking, camping--"
1992.91-2051,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.02,2984.92,Fishing?
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2984.92,2985.72,--Fishing.
1992.91-2051,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.742,3018.192,Exclusive rights.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3018.192,3019.777,--Exclusive rights to graze cattle.
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3047.411,3065.572,"But, Mr. Feldman, it is clear I suppose that under the act the tribe did not retain the power to exclude people from public uses of the park area and the river--"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3065.572,3066.257,--That's right.
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3066.257,3067.074,--and the reservoir.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3067.074,3067.607,That's right.
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3067.607,3072.845,They can camp and fish and use it presumably.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3072.845,3073.845,That's right.
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3073.845,3078.565,Can the tribe exclude people from coming onto that property?
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3078.565,3081.017,What I would say about exclusion is the--
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3081.017,3082.134,In your view.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3082.134,3094.425,"--They can't keep people off altogether, but to impose a licensing fee basically for the benefits that the people are getting from using the facilities on the land is different from excluding them altogether."
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3096.877,3098.729,"Well, it's pretty close to it."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3101.93,3121.992,"--Right, and if the licensing fee were prohibitively high or unusual in some way in which I don't think it is in this case, or if other tribal regulations in some way essentially force nonmembers not to use the land, then I think those would be preempted by the Flood Control Act and by the Federal... the fact that the Federal Government--"
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3121.992,3127.396,"--Since the act was so specific, isn't it rather odd that it didn't cover this aspect?"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3127.396,3129.932,--The 1954 act?
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3129.932,3130.665,Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3130.665,3131.8,I don't think it is.
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3148.745,3156.499,"Well, do you say that the Federal Government would have the right to require hunting and fishing licenses from people?"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3156.499,3160.653,"I think that... actually, I think that with... it may be a little bit of a complex answer."
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3183.982,3186.934,"So, you don't take the position that the Federal Government could require licensing."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3186.934,3199.761,"Well, but I do think outside... I think aside from that one proviso, I think with respect to the rest of the land area and with respect to other sorts of regulation of the land, I think the Corps does have authority to do what it deems necessary."
1992.91-2051,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3204.146,3211.652,"Well, what's the meaning of the language giving the States whatever regulatory authority--"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3211.652,3215.788,--I think the State may have also have regulatory authority over the land.
1992.91-2051,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.608,3226.678,--This is an incredibly muddled situation that your answer suggests.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3226.678,3231.047,"Well, I guess... let me try to clarify it for you."
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3248.575,3249.877,How do we know it would include tribal?
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3262.335,3264.053,"--Yes, I would take the word local to mean--"
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.053,3264.47,You would take it.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3266.17,3267.005,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.005,3268.505,I notice that they're not on your brief.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3275.492,3278.63,I wouldn't attribute significance to that.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.13,3284.098,Can I assume that everything you argue is agreed to by the Corps?
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3284.098,3284.432,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.963,3307.647,"Well, that's an easy case then."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3329.729,3334.031,I believe that respondents make that argument in their brief.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3334.031,3337.567,"Make the argument that this regulation, local laws under this regulation--"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3337.567,3338.069,Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.721,3343.237,--I don't get it.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3343.237,3361.967,"--unlike in Montana, this land is ultimately governed by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government not only does not see anything inconsistent in permitting tribal regulation of hunting and fishing on this land, especially in light of the checkerboard nature of the area being surrounded by lands on which the tribe undoubtedly has jurisdiction."
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3361.967,3373.842,And you say it is the interpretation of the Corps of Engineers that local laws in section 327.0 of their rules and regulations governing public use of water resource development includes tribal laws.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3373.842,3374.308,Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.367,3400.159,"Yes, but how can that all survive the provision in section 4 that the water areas shall be open to public use generally without charge for boating, swimming, bathing, fishing, and so forth?"
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3400.159,3410.698,"--I think that, first of all, that without... I think that that is directed toward the Corps, and that was Congress' prescription to the Corps that it should not make charges for access to these areas."
1992.91-2051,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3431.344,3432.13,"Well, and... I'm sorry."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3435.248,3435.882,--Yes.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3435.882,3457.162,"Anyway, Mr. Feldman, that sentence goes on to say as... shall be maintained when such use is determined by the Secretary of the Army not to be contrary to the public interest, all under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Army may deem necessary, which is why I think that provision of C.F.R. is so crucial here."
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3457.162,3457.812,That's right.
1992.91-2051,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.812,3462.833,They don't really have to allow any fishing at all if they don't think it's in the public interest.
1992.91-2051,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3462.833,3475.473,"That's correct, and generally speaking, if the Corps, for instance, felt that the flood control or irrigation purposes of this project would be disserved by permitting people on some area of it or on the whole thing, then they could prohibit any hunting and fishing on the project."
1992.91-2051,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.473,3487.115,But you can't tell from that regulation whether State and local laws... whether it gives the nod to the State or the tribe because both hunting laws are covered by those... that regulation.
