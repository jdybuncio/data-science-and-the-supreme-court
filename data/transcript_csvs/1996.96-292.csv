1996.96-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.026,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-292, Marian Johnson v. Kristine Fankell."
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,16.423,20.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,64.794,78.082,"Do you think, Mr. Gilmore, that if the Idaho legislature had amended its judicial code to allow appeals in this kind of case that you say the Federal statute requires the supreme court of Idaho would have entertained this appeal?"
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,78.082,103.14,"That's a very difficult question to answer, Your Honor, because the Idaho supreme court in three instances had ruled that its court rules take precedence over statutes in the area of conflict in rules of procedure, rules of evidence, and rules regarding a special statutory court that was established to adjudicate water rights in the Snake River basin."
1996.96-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.14,108.612,But it hasn't extended... the court has not said the same with respect to appellate rules?
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,108.612,109.434,That is an open question.
1996.96-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.405,120.95,"Well, it seemed to... you know, the one sense... I believe in one sense orders seemed to say this was not a final, whatever it is that the Idaho stature requires."
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,134.36,145.968,"I simply cannot concede that, because the entire recent jurisprudence in Idaho has been for the State supreme court to say its rules preempt statutes are inconsistent."
1996.96-292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,145.968,169.554,"But in any case, however the State speaks, whether it speaks through the legislature or it speaks through the supreme court, there is an agency of the State which is capable of valuing the State's interest here, and if it believes that the State's interest really does require the appealability of a qualified immunity ruling, there's some agency of a State that can say, that's the regime we will have."
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,169.554,178.91,The Idaho supreme court could adopt an appellate rule that would explicitly provide for appealability of denial of absolute or qualified immunity motions.
1996.96-292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,178.91,183.662,So that ultimately the responsibility for the nonappealability is with the State itself.
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,183.662,185.866,It is with one of the branches of State government.
1996.96-292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,185.866,186.086,Yes.
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,206.027,214.342,"Because the defendants in this case, or the petitioners here, are sued in their individual capacities."
1996.96-292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.587,226.16,But if they were merely individuals there wouldn't be any kind of immunity that they could lay hold of.
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,230.514,234.607,"That is correct, only governmental officers."
1996.96-292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.607,242.231,But let me ask one anterior question about where the rule-making authority is.
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,255.959,263.716,"It's Rule 12(a) of the Idaho supreme court, and the Idaho supreme court decision of Todd v. Budell states that that was modeled upon 1292."
1996.96-292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.716,267.099,"But the source of it is the Idaho supreme court, not the Idaho legislature?"
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,267.099,267.927,That's correct.
1996.96-292,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,267.927,271.12,What was your answer to Justice Souter?
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,291.713,302.853,"The answer to that is, the State officers who the Attorney General must represent want to assert these personal defenses that you have held as a matter of Federal law--"
1996.96-292,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.853,321.482,"--What is it as a matter of... no, I take it the Federal law is that 1983, in giving liability, imposing liability, in helping plaintiffs attain certain things, doesn't reach as far as the area where what the State person did was lawful or uncertain."
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,344.878,349.052,"--In a literal sense, the Federal interest is not hurt."
1996.96-292,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.052,353.233,"Well, if that's so, then isn't that the end of the matter, because... well, why not?"
1996.96-292,0,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,353.233,359.567,Because... because all of these officers of the State of Idaho are Federal citizens and have citizens' rights.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1524.319,1535.517,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.872,1584.548,"Well, when you say nonrecognition of the collateral order doctrine, Mr. Latta, do you mean that the supreme court of Idaho has rejected it, or simply has never confronted it one way or the other?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1584.548,1601.89,"--It has never confronted it, and based on the jurisprudence as... and I believe Mr. Gilmore and I both read it it would be unlikely that they would do it because the door is open by another means, Appellate Rule 12, that allows for permissive appeals to bring those up."
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.226,1616.809,"And what does the permissive appeal rule provide, briefly?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1616.809,1632.46,"--In this case, to illustrate, having received the order denying qualified immunity from the trial judge here, the State could go back to the trial judge and ask for its order permitting a permissive appeal to the supreme court."
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.515,1646.188,"It's like Federal 1292(b), the--"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1646.188,1646.839,--Exactly.
1996.96-292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1653.752,1658.637,--Does the trial court have to give its permission to have the ruling appealed under that discretionary regime?
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1658.637,1659.947,"No, it would not."
1996.96-292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1666.751,1676.028,I'm trying to ascertain what role does the trial judge have in establishing whether or not there may be a permissive appeal?
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1676.028,1684.363,--His role under Rule 12 is to look at requests for the order and say it should or should not be the subject of a permissive appeal.
1996.96-292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.363,1687.846,"And if he says that it should not, then that ends the matter?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1687.846,1688.127,No.
1996.96-292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.435,1726.351,"Well, I suppose, then, if we were to say that this is a substantive, very significant right, the right to have an interlocutory ruling, then it would be then an abuse of discretion of Idaho law not to take the appeal, and so at least the right could be enforced under the existing procedural structure in Idaho."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1726.351,1729.183,I would agree it could be under that scenario.
1996.96-292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1729.183,1737.768,"Mr. Latta, I thought that Idaho's creation of that rule, which does modify 1292(b), is to make it totally discretionary on its part."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1759.944,1762.884,I was unfortunately mixing the two court systems.
1996.96-292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.608,1786.959,Who's going to enforce that?
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1786.959,1795.174,"It might be... it might occur only in the circumstance that brings us here, where we are in front of the Supreme Court by virtue of--"
1996.96-292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.174,1798.136,"If we don't take a case, how are you going to get here?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1798.136,1802.57,--In... it is not likely that I would be the one who needed to get here.
1996.96-292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.401,1816.629,"Well, just focusing on the Idaho court based on your comments to Justice Ginsburg I assume no one could tell the Idaho court that it has to take... has to exercise its discretion to take the appeal."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1853.824,1897.773,"Well, the... because it is permissive as to the Idaho supreme court, then it would only be answerable to this Court on an abuse of discretion theory, but the solution to the problem presented by the permissive nature of Idaho Appellate Rule 12 is in what was suggested by Justice Ginsburg earlier, and that is that this represents and tells us that the first opportunity to exercise the ability to get exactly what you want in the way of the interlocutory appeal is to take this Court's... excuse me, take Congress' route, and that is to remove it to Federal court."
1996.96-292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.773,1908.139,"Which might be equally inconvenient for your client, given the distance that Mr. Gilmore just told us about, that the State court is much more accessible."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1908.139,1939.54,"There are three Federal courtrooms in Idaho, and for a large number of people in Idaho it's a very long haul to a Federal courtroom, but if the State believes on behalf of its actors that it must have the right of interlocutory appeal, then the answer is to go to Federal court, not to be subjected to the discretion of the Idaho supreme court where they may not--"
1996.96-292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.54,1947.085,I had though maybe the closest case supporting petitioner was Felder v. Casey.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1954.951,1969.15,"--I take solace in the language of Felder v. Casey, because it talks in that case of the natural and permissible consequences of the otherwise uniformly applicable State rule."
1996.96-292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1979.946,1987.082,"Well, it wasn't dealing with the appeal problem, it was dealing with a notice problem."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,1987.082,1987.971,--That's correct.
1996.96-292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1987.971,2001.331,"But the principle, at least, there was that there were times when we were going to impose certain requirements on State courts in connection with 1983 suits."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2001.331,2001.771,That's right.
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2013.449,2018.482,"That was... I mean, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2043.947,2044.528,That is correct.
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2044.528,2055.467,"And Felder was a case where they said the plaintiff has to show that he's hurt within 120 days, and they say that's such a short time, 120 days to notify that you're hurt, that it's about the same thing, kicking it out."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2069.996,2085.588,"Well, the State interest that's being protected by the immunity rule belongs to the States, not to the individuals, as has been offered by petitioners as a reason for applying this Federal rule and this Federal procedure in State court."
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2087.949,2093.121,"Well, I suppose that would be true if everybody knew that the State was going to pay the judgment."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2110.833,2124.513,--The choice of how the State is going to exercise its actors' immunities is up to the State.
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.513,2131.556,"Well, I'm sure that's true if it's a State... if it's a State liability scheme, but this is a Federal liability scheme."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2139.222,2157.884,"And the State can elect to expand on that defense by paying for the Office of the Attorney General to defend them or indemnifying them, or, as was suggested earlier, telling the State actors when they come to work, you may be subject to a civil rights case."
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2157.884,2163.367,"Well, but suppose the State doesn't indemnify the persons, or the State treasury is insufficient?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2174.646,2181.649,The State has not abolished the Federal defense in this case.
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.371,2205.445,"Well, but the State of Idaho does recognize the doctrine of qualified immunity, doesn't it?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2205.445,2206.346,"Very much so, yes."
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.346,2212.54,So that all Idaho is denying that the Federal courts give is the interlocutory appeal.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2212.54,2226.088,"That is correct, and the distinction that's of importance here is the manner in which the interlocutory appeal is taken in the Federal system compared to the State system."
1996.96-292,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.088,2228.479,Then you... I don't want to interrupt.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2229.871,2232.162,I wanted to answer... excuse me.
1996.96-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2282.576,2293.303,"But why wasn't it a complete answer in Felder, then, to say well, you could have filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, rather than in the circuit court?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2293.303,2314.416,"My understanding of the distinction here would be that if you could have filed in the Federal district court in Wisconsin you would have still been subject to the 120-day rule, and that was what... that limitation on bringing the State's rights was what was fatally wrong with the Wisconsin notice of claim statute."
1996.96-292,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.416,2336.541,"I thought what was wrong in Felder was that in the State court, by imposing the time requirement, the right in effect was shrunk a little bit, and they said you can't shrink these rights against the wishes of those who assert them."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2358.435,2361.219,"It has been exercised, yes."
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.956,2385.602,"Well, if this is an optional thing with the State, then I suppose the State could decide not to accept the qualified immunity doctrine at all, if it thinks its officers don't need it, right?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2385.602,2386.393,That is correct.
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.62,2396.499,"Well, I suppose--"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2418.324,2427.881,--They could direct or make a policy decision not to use the benefit of the qualified immunity defense.
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.881,2429.11,I'm not talking about the executive.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2430.352,2431.374,In the State courts.
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.374,2432.045,In the State courts?
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2445.313,2458.081,"The... if the question, if I understand the question, if it's collapsing the interlocutory appeal rule into the qualified immunity issue, then--"
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.081,2459.52,"Oh, I mean... they go together, it seems to me."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2490.272,2491.992,--At the fullest extent the answer is yes.
1996.96-292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.992,2505.77,"You certainly don't have to take that position to defend this case, because there's a vast difference between giving up a procedural right that does not affect the ultimate outcome of the case and giving up a defense that would change the outcome in many, many cases."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2505.77,2507.102,"I would agree with you, Justice--"
1996.96-292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.102,2514.536,"And in Felder, of course, part of the analysis was that the statute affected the outcome in a significant number of cases, and that's not true here."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2514.536,2540.665,"--That's why I looked at the distinction between qualified immunity as a defense and the interlocutory appeal, because irrespective of not being able to exercise the interlocutory appeal that they seek by imposing 1291 on the State, the immunity defense will never go away, and it wouldn't matter what kind of a recovery the plaintiff would obtain down below if the State was, in fact, immune from suit the Supreme Court would so hold."
1996.96-292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.665,2550.279,"Yes, but in one respect it does go away, because the one element of the immunity defense is the element not to have to stand trial, and that does go away."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2559.165,2562.348,If... I would disagree.
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2571.534,2575.317,"No, but it determines the outcome of whether they have to stand trial or not."
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2575.317,2575.898,--Exactly.
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.898,2578.189,In that respect there is a determination--
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2578.189,2578.469,There is--
1996.96-292,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2578.469,2579.818,--that the bell cannot be unrung.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2579.818,2595.129,"--With respect to the trial bell, yes, it cannot be unrung, and if you don't want to hear that chimed in the background, either change Rule 11 or remove it to Federal court where you're guaranteed to be in a position to take the interlocutory appeal that they seek."
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.129,2598.883,"Well, it really doesn't deny the right not to stand trial, does it?"
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2598.883,2600.405,No.
1996.96-292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.405,2602.665,The person has that right not to stand trial.
1996.96-292,1,45356,w_b_latta_jr,,2623.449,2624.368,"No, not at all."
1996.96-292,2,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,2990.511,2992.431,Thank you.
1996.96-292,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.074,3015.916,"But Felder v. Casey just matches what happens on the diversity side, doesn't it?"
1996.96-292,2,35945,michael_s_gilmore,,3035.708,3037.01,I think not.
