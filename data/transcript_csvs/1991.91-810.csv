1991.91-810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.637,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-810, The City of Burlington v. Dague."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,13.581,17.922,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.667,190.1,How about that it's contrary to the fee-shifting statute?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,190.1,193.702,"It's also... for that reason, contrary--"
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.702,194.491,Shouldn't you start with that?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,194.491,205.61,"--Well, the fee-shifting statute provides, of course, that fees should be reasonable, and this Court has determined on several occasions that--"
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.61,208.873,It only provides for fees when you win--
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,208.873,209.754,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,209.754,210.856,--not when you lose.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,210.856,220.423,"Precisely the point that we were raising with respect to the basis for this Court's determination, that it is absolutely bizarre--"
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.423,226.397,"And if you're getting enhanced when you win, you're getting enhanced and being paid for when you lose."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,226.397,227.458,--That's correct.
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.458,231.34,"That's just a plain old statutory question, isn't it?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,231.34,234.365,"We would certainly contend that it was, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.458,260.744,"And the arguments for both sides are pretty well set forth in the various opinions for the Court in the second Delaware case, aren't they?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,260.744,262.366,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.454,277.856,Otherwise you wouldn't be--
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,277.856,279.626,--Otherwise we wouldn't be here today.
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.626,281.289,--And you wouldn't be being paid to be here.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,281.289,283.229,That's correct.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.43,360.983,"Mr. Clapp, may I ask a question to show my ignorance of this whole area of the law?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,365.057,382.421,"Your Honor, I understand that the term lodestar was coined by the Third Circuit in its early development of the method of fee calculation that refers to a base of all hours expended on a case, reasonably expended on a case, times the reasonable hourly rate."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.482,388.495,It always struck me as a strange kind of a term.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,388.495,390.195,"It struck me as a strange term, too."
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.195,392.759,"But it nevertheless was adopted by this Court, wasn't it?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,394.422,397.243,The term was adopted by this Court.
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.243,401.677,"Well, we do do strange things."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,401.677,402.606,The method of--
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.606,404.868,"Stare decisis, as they say."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,404.868,416.206,--The method that is referred to by the term that was adopted by this Court was a modification of that Third Circuit approach that had been developed prior to that time.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.206,422.162,"In computing the lodestar, now that we know what it is, you do take market forces into account, do you?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,422.162,432.41,"My understanding of that, Your Honor, is that the market determines what the reasonable hourly rate to be used in calculating the fee is."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.41,448.411,"What if an economist could convince us, and I probably couldn't, that the market is different in a free market when you're just charging clients and you don't have Government mixing into the thing, the market pays a little more when there's a contingency involved than it does when there's no contingency involved?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,448.411,456.328,"Assuming that such evidence could be developed, then that evidence would simply be evidence of what the market rate is in that particular market."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,456.328,461.924,"And then it would indicate that the contingency factor would be reasonable, I guess, because within the higher--"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,461.924,473.853,"It would simply indicate that to whatever extent that market compensates for contingency, that figure is already reflected in the, in that market hourly rate."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.853,482.879,"--On the lode, because the lodestar assumed when it is worked out that there is a, that if there has been a contingency factor, it was taken into account in computing the lodestar?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,482.879,493.366,"It was taken into account by the market in determining what the market rate was, and the courts should be limited to simply determining what that market rate is."
1991.91-810,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.366,498.189,"But it isn't the fact of contingency, is it?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,503.524,531.862,"The definition of the risk of loss is complicated, Your Honor, and I would address that question specifically by saying whether, or the extent of the risk of loss in a particular case is a function not only of the complexity of the issues advanced, and to that extent the plaintiff controls that issue by the extent of the relief that is granted, or requested in a case like this."
1991.91-810,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,531.862,532.593,Mr. Clapp--
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,532.593,534.847,"Yes, sir, Justice Blackmun."
1991.91-810,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,534.847,536.016,--I have a question.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,548.565,550.037,"There certainly is, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,555.773,559.464,How does that affect the outcome of this argument?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,559.464,594.498,"Well, assuming, Your Honor, that a rational support for fee enhancement, lodestar fee enhancement, could be constructed, I think amicus, the American Bar Association and this Court in other occasions has recognized that a fee arrangement between plaintiff and their counsel may have the effect of reducing whatever risk would otherwise be inherent in a particular case."
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.582,657.632,"Assume that we say that contingent fees are inappropriate and that the court is concluding a lodestar fee and the court hears expert witnesses or considers an affidavit, and the testimony is that in cases of this kind since recovery is uncertain the hourly rate is generally $50 an hour higher than other hourly rates."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,660.102,662.284,"We think not, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.39,687.942,"Well, what if the testimony is that this is how the market compensates for it?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,687.942,695.057,Then the market rate in that particular case would reflect the--
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.057,696.469,The $50 an hour increase?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,696.469,697.911,--the $50 an hour increase.
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,697.911,702.896,Well then are we engaged in a circular enterprise no matter which way we rule?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,702.896,720.959,"To the extent that the Court becomes involved in trying to parse the elements that a particular market rate reflects, my answer to Justice Kennedy's question would be that there is no need for the Court to get involved in that parsing."
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,731.895,746.784,"Well, should the market be defined as the market for attorney's fees generally and not just for fees of cases of this type, so that if you were the trial judge you'd ask a defense firm what they charge an insurance company by the hour and use that as the rate?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,746.784,758.272,"The question before a court in any fee-fixing case, fee-shifting case, is what is the appropriate market rate to use."
1991.91-810,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.35,812.168,"Well, if there's no objection to the trial court taking into account the discrete market which consists of those who undertake representation in cases of this type, and if that discrete market includes an enhanced hourly rate for the contingency factor then it seems to me it makes no difference what we rule in this case."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,814.602,825.207,I think there is a basic distinction that the lodestar method adopted by this Court contemplates.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.2,861.472,Mr. Clapp--
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,861.472,861.701,Yes.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.701,864.044,--Could I test that with you just a moment?
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,901.199,908.514,"If that's the evidence, Your Honor, the evidence with respect to the $40 fee is irrelevant to this particular market."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.416,923.485,It's a contract case.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,923.485,933.282,--reflects cross-subsidation of other efforts by that attorney representing similar plaintiffs.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.93,960.47,"No, it's the bargain... the client had the choice."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,969.837,970.588,That's correct.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.588,971.71,But the other one is also.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,974.634,979.99,But it's a different market from fee-shifting statutes for the reasons that I have indicated.
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.99,982.574,"Oh, I see, we have a special market when there's a fee-shifting statute?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,982.574,997.205,"No, we have the market... whether we're talking about a market for legal services or a market for automobiles, Your Honor, reflects different subclasses, and fees that are negotiated--"
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.205,997.356,That's right.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1000.595,1009.191,"--Well, but fees that are determined with respect, or by negotiation between a party and his attorney--"
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.191,1012.784,Against the background of what alternatives are available in the market.
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1012.784,1033.446,"--But that... understand, Your Honor, that in these sorts of cases, in fee-shifting cases, the client is going to have no interest in limiting his attorney's compensation where the case is on a contingency basis, because he's not going to pay it anyway."
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.324,1049.631,"No, but I'm assuming he would, you try to make him... you would make the statutory fee be one that would be a duplicate of what would have been negotiated in a free market."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1050.802,1057.968,"And my response to that is, Your Honor, if the free market doesn't reflect that hourly rate to the extent the courts intervene--"
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.968,1062.122,"Well, how did the $40 figure get there if it wasn't determined by market forces?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1074.172,1079.578,"--Well, the market might justify that--"
1991.91-810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.578,1079.728,"Well, it did when I was in practice."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1079.728,1084.602,"--Your Honor, but it would not be the result of free market operation."
1991.91-810,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.816,1098.032,"But your argument assumes that if the client had hung tough and said no, $25 is as high as I'm going to go, he would have taken the case anyway on a contingent fee."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1113.373,1113.513,It's not necessary to make that assumption.
1991.91-810,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1113.513,1123.66,"Maybe what you're saying is go ahead and make that assumption and see what happens, and if it turns out that nobody takes these cases, then maybe you'd better modify your assumption."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1130.464,1147.277,"Well, and my response to that should be, Your Honor, is that if in fact the market rates are insufficient to attract counsel, then Congress should make decisions about what steps it wants to take to enforce its policy."
1991.91-810,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1147.918,1159.095,"Well, isn't the problem with that response that Congress, I thought, gave the courts the responsibility for determining a rate that would in fact attract?"
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1159.095,1164.841,--Congress authorized the court to award a reasonable fee.
1991.91-810,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1177.507,1193.148,"No, but I thought you were telling me that if we took the hang tough position as fact-finders and said look, we're going to latch onto the $25 figure and if it works, fine, that's the figure we'll use for the future, maybe adjusted for inflation."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1202.056,1203.358,That's precisely my point.
1991.91-810,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.358,1213.316,"Well, I think you're saying, then, that it is not our's, it is not the court's responsibility to determine as a matter of fact what is necessary to attract counsel to take these cases."
1991.91-810,0,35585,michael_b_clapp,,1222.283,1224.724,"In essence that's what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.76,1247.16,"Thank you, Mr. Clapp."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1249.233,1260.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.154,1330.907,"What about the situation which certainly was more common at the time when I practiced, I'll either take it so much an hour if you're good for the fee, win or lose, or else I'll take one-third or one-half, you know, not always one-half, of the recovery if we win?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1333.231,1345.249,"I think that that is still the prevailing practice, that when a lawyer takes a contingency, makes a contingency arrangement he contracts with the client for some percentage of the ultimate recovery."
1991.91-810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.979,1409.806,"Well then when you say a fee is fair in the sense of the $40 fee, you mean it's fair by virtue of the fact it was consented to, and not by virtue of the fact that it represented market?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1409.806,1412.297,--That's correct.
1991.91-810,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1434.105,1439.54,"Well, doesn't that simply mean that you've got to look for your examples outside the sphere of these kinds of cases?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1439.54,1443.192,"--That's correct, you do have to look outside--"
1991.91-810,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1443.192,1450.388,"But it doesn't mean that the $40 is not the market figure, assuming that that was not a case of this sort, assuming we're outside this sphere of cases."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1452.491,1471.904,"--Yes, it may be possible to establish a market figure that prevails in the private, unregulated market, but to apply that in the context of fee-shifting is to say that the defendant should pay not on the basis of what he did that led to the lawsuit but on the basis of what arrangement the plaintiff has made with his client."
1991.91-810,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.904,1477.79,Do you think you can establish such a contingent fee in the private market for a category of cases?
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1477.79,1478.311,No.
1991.91-810,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.311,1483.466,"I mean, isn't it the nature of a contingent fee that it depends enormously upon how good the case looks to the lawyer?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1483.466,1484.636,That's right.
1991.91-810,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.953,1497.326,"For a whole category, but I don't... that doesn't strike me as likely."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1497.326,1506.651,"No, I think that normally the percentage of recovery is going to in large part reflect the amount at stake as well as the merits of the particular case."
1991.91-810,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.733,1514.907,"And the latter would be quite, quite counter-productive as far as the policies of this statute are concerned."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1531.859,1532.869,--That's correct.
1991.91-810,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1549.173,1557.407,Are you saying the difficulty of the case is irrelevant in computing this magnificent certitude that we call the lodestar?
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1557.407,1563.722,--In practice it has turned out to be largely irrelevant because the hourly--
1991.91-810,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.722,1570.567,"Well, should trial judges be instructed that they may not take into account the difficulty of the case in setting the fee?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1570.567,1586.068,"--Not as a separate matter, Justice Kennedy, because the difficulty of the case is going to be reflected both in the hourly rate that a lawyer of the adequate experience is able to charge as well as the number of hours expended in litigating the case."
1991.91-810,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.555,1599.21,"What about the probable merits of the case, the probability of success?"
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1599.21,1608.404,"No, we think that the probability of success is irrelevant in calculating the lodestar and also should be irrelevant as a separate matter--"
1991.91-810,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.404,1619.694,I take it most of the circuits are in disagreement with that proposition and most of the circuits do include probability or likelihood of success in assessing the lodestar amount?
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1620.265,1622.796,--Basically right.
1991.91-810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.167,1705.511,The problem with that is in cases where there are no damages being sought or awarded.
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1705.511,1709.033,"I'm sorry, I don't--"
1991.91-810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.033,1727.666,"Well, where only an injunction is sought, why, what deal the lawyer and his client make seems to me to be irrelevant."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1727.666,1730.818,--It absolutely is irrelevant in our view as well.
1991.91-810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.344,1828.885,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1991.91-810,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1828.885,1829.135,Thank you.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,1832.117,1847.948,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.62,1951.652,"Mr. Goldstein, you say there's no question it's taken into account in the legal marketplace, but what evidence is there before us that it's taken into account in a differential and hourly rate as opposed to a percentage of recovery?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,1951.652,1957.175,"--Well, that's a good question, is how--"
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.175,1958.277,I'm glad you think so.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,1959.438,1979.721,"--In this particular case there is evidence in the record that attorneys in the Burlington, Vermont market expect a higher return for their hourly time when they take a case on a contingent basis."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.721,1993.459,"Lawyers quote a higher, or simply their experience is that they take, that their percentage recovery gives them a higher hourly rate?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,1993.459,2010.342,"That's one way that it can be shown, as to what expected hourly rate will be satisfactory for a lawyer to invest, as Mr. Pearson did, 7 years of time and 3,000 hours with only a chance of getting paid."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.147,2061.578,Jenner and Block agreed to take.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2061.578,2062.027,"--Yes, excuse me."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.781,2064.893,And then what was the other?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2064.893,2072.539,"And if they succeeded then they would get paid 2.5 times their hourly rate, and that's set forth in the agreement."
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.103,2080.145,That is all by contractual agreement.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2107.156,2120.604,"Justice Scalia, the one contract, the contract that Mr. Camen attaches to his declaration, would not determine the market, but it would be evidence of the market."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.102,2193.993,"Mr. Goldstein, could I ask you, am I right in reading the court below as not thinking that Delaware Valley II was, should be used as any guide to resolving the fee issue, and then instead it just relied on one of its prior, one of its prior authorities and certainly didn't go through the approach that Justice O'Connor suggested?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2225.887,2227.149,Yes.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.129,2255.34,"You mean they just referred to the market and decided what it would take to get a lawyer in this case, rather than having any kind of actual proof that this plaintiff tried to get a lawyer and couldn't find one, or what?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2255.34,2291.203,"Well, like the standard adopted by Justice O'Connor, the proof depended upon what was generally expected in the Burlington, Vermont market, and Mr. Pearson and the Dagues put in the affidavits of three practitioners in the Burlington market in addition to three affidavits by members of the firm saying that there was no incentive to take a case without an--"
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.203,2307.672,The court below didn't determine its fee based on either the... either of the opinions in Delaware II.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2315.859,2317.22,"--No, that's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.734,2463.837,What claim of enhancement was presented to the Court?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2463.837,2468.631,"--A 2.0 claim, that is a doubling."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.938,2483.4,Were you claiming that it was... a 50 percent enhancement really reflected what the market in Burlington was?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2483.4,2484.512,--A doubling.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.813,2491.447,"And the court said sorry, that isn't what the market requires in Burlington?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2491.447,2492.639,That's correct.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.639,2500.634,"How did he, how does a court go around figuring out how to disagree with these experts in the market?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2500.634,2513.041,"The court, as courts do, sometimes reject experts, sometimes reject testimony and sometimes accept it in part."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.291,2521.408,"Does it involve, doesn't it involve a court deciding what the degree of risk is?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2531.705,2532.666,"--Well, this court--"
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.666,2533.067,Is that right?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2533.067,2539.601,"--I'm not sure if the question goes to what this judge did or if it's a general question that you're asking me, Justice White."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.601,2541.752,I'll take it both ways.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2541.752,2542.002,Okay.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.532,2553.541,And do you think that's proper?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2553.541,2554.192,--No.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.192,2559.595,"I didn't think you did, because you put in, you asked for 50 percent, which you thought reflected the market."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2559.595,2559.825,No.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.527,2562.877,You must have thought it reflected the market.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2562.877,2563.047,--Excuse me.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.648,2595.279,50 percent.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2600.353,2602.696,Whatever the evidence would show.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.696,2605.077,"Well, you thought it showed 1.5."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2605.077,2607.147,"2.0, actually."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.147,2607.708,I mean 2.0.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2607.708,2609.07,Yes.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.454,2628.492,"Well, if you thought it ought to be done according to Justice O'Connor's opinion, which would have come out with 2.0, you should have cross-petitioned for not enough money."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2628.492,2635.227,"--Well, I think there's a time... well, perhaps we should have, but we did not."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.31,2778.058,"Some of those limitations that Congress put in later statutes were in response to the emerging fee jurisprudence of this Court, were they not?"
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2778.058,2788.605,"Well, I think yes, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, but I think it goes to prove our point rather than undercut it."
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.303,2895.905,"It's harder to do that when the later law is a specific response to a judicial decision that has come in the interim, because if... if you know what I mean."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2909.195,2912.517,"I am, but... perhaps I am--"
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.517,2914.6,And that was not the case in Casey.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2925.287,2929.5,"--I'm not trying to say that's a direct relationship with Casey, it's just the principle."
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.782,2974.264,But not particularly on contingencies.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2980.088,2992.895,"Well, in the American-Mexican Chamizal Convention Act of 1964 reasonable attorney's fees shall not exceed 10 percent of the amount awarded, and similar restrictions--"
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.895,2999.62,"No, but, but you have some later statute that specifically says shall not include any amount for contingency."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,2999.62,3002.011,"--Well, for bonus or multipliers."
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.011,3003.282,Bonus or multipliers.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3003.282,3004.715,"You know, I really think that--"
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.715,3006.086,That's impressive.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3019.587,3025.704,"--Justice Scalia, I hate to argue with you if you say an argument you heard was impressive--"
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.704,3026.704,"No, I want you to."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3027.937,3032.941,"--But let me just say that I think that, you know, the terms changed."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.72,3056.213,--But they were still saying a reasonable fee but no allowance for contingencies.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3056.213,3061.527,Reasonable attorney's fees which shall not exceed 10 percent of the amount awarded.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.527,3066.509,Or will not reflect any risk.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3066.509,3070.533,Above the amount of risk reflected by the 10 percent.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.533,3075.635,But even with that limitation it still would have been a reasonable attorney's fee.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3075.635,3084.143,"Well, there was a limitation on what could be a reasonable attorney's fee."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.143,3085.032,"Well, it was still reasonable."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3085.032,3089.056,By the definition under that act.
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.056,3090.878,"Yes, under that act."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3104.117,3134.598,"I think Congress determined that a reasonable attorney's fees under a particular act which could be reasonable with limits, but with other acts, such as the ones before this Court, a reasonable attorney's fees would be one that would be motored by the economic forces in the legal marketplace without limit, other than the limit of the discipline of the marketplace."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.449,3312.88,So what should we do?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3330.495,3335.447,--I have two answers to that.
1991.91-810,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3415.653,3421.456,There's no market for contingent fees in non-monetary cases.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3431.553,3449.946,"--Well, the Congress addressed that problem, and that's one of the reasons there are attorney fee statutes in a case like this in which there, it principally is focused on an injunction to close the toxic landfill or a civil rights case where it's to integrate a plant."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.907,3483.668,Congress said all this where?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3483.668,3487.933,--In the Senate report--
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3487.933,3489.052,Not in the statute.
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3489.052,3492.484,--Congress... yes.
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3495.928,3500.499,And the committees used this language you're referring to?
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3500.499,3502.652,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.639,3565.306,"I would think if it's, I would think the way to go about this compensation for risk would be to pay the lawyer when he loses."
1991.91-810,2,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,3586.09,3598.158,"Justice White, I would disagree with you on that, but the important point is that Congress has decided that question and determined that only prevailing parties obtain fees."
1991.91-810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3631.19,3633.242,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
