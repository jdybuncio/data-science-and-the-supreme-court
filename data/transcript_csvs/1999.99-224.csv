1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.362,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 99-224, Charles Miller v. Richard French, consolidated with 99-582, United States v. Richard French."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,15.168,17.804,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,37.043,39.482,"Mr. Laramore, let me ask you one procedural question."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,45.551,46.367,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.367,53.862,And in your brief you say it's set for hearing on the merits in June of 2000.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,57.066,70.417,"The case... there was no action on the motion to vacate during the entire time the appeal pended in the Seventh Circuit, and once the appeal was concluded in the Seventh Circuit, the district court judge--"
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,70.417,75.216,But it would seem the appeal would have nothing to do with going ahead with the motion itself.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,75.216,78.043,"--Well, we don't disagree with that."
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.046,82.146,For 3 years.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,82.146,83.828,--until after the appeal was... was completed.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,96.05,97.911,Did you request--
1999.99-224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,97.911,98.815,--Why didn't you ask for mandamus?
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,98.815,117.739,"Our... our appeal was pending at that point in... on the merits of the automatic stay issue, and we chose not to go the mandamus route given how procedurally complex that would have made the case at that point."
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,117.739,125.151,"Mr. Laramore, did you ask the district court to proceed during the pendency of the appeal to the Seventh Circuit?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,125.151,128.112,We did not formally make that request of the district court.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,128.112,128.792,You didn't ask the district court.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,134.912,144.932,"Well, that's right, and we... it was our understanding that the district court... without it having made a formal request, that the district court wanted to wait until the appeal was concluded."
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.932,148.091,"Well, I suppose you had no interest in having the case mooted, did you?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,148.091,154.786,"Well, we are interested in--"
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.786,158.408,Which would have been the situation I suppose if the district court had proceeded--
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,158.408,160.577,--That would have perhaps mooted this case--
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.577,161.292,--and... and had given you what you wanted.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,161.292,170.476,"--That would have perhaps mooted this automatic stay issue, although perhaps not under the doctrine of capability of repetition but evading review."
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.744,238.885,"Mr. Laramore, I didn't... I know that's your argument, but I didn't follow it entirely because it seems to me if you suspend the decree and it doesn't become operative again until all the findings that have been made... all the findings required by the new act had been made, how is that different from just starting fresh and making those findings?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,253.171,265.994,It is correct that the injunction only continues if the district court finds that it's necessary to correct an ongoing constitutional violation.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.661,301.073,What does the judgment say?
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,306.257,306.725,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.725,313.122,What it prescribes to remedy that violation is... is not... is not part of the judgment.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,315.635,317.719,"It is part of the remedy, yes."
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.719,319.564,But it's part of the judgment too.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,322.652,324.558,"Well, it certainly--"
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.558,329.136,I never heard of this suggested distinction between remedy and judgment if the remedy is part of the judgment.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,329.136,334.918,--And certainly this statute is aimed at dealing with the remedial portions of... of--
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.918,337.13,"Yes, but... but you say... you say--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,337.13,337.704,--however we describe it.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.704,351.459,"--that the... you say that the... if you agree with that, then... then you must retract your assertion that... that Congress can, in fact, change the remedies that are available for the future."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,368.172,368.548,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.548,372.51,"Well, if that's the case, then it can't be part of the judgment."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,372.51,379.025,I'm not sure that I precisely agree with what you said.
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.664,419.005,I'm not... I'm not sure the term judgment is quite accurate here.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,434.125,434.727,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.727,439.847,"--which came up from the First Circuit, rather than like the Plaut case which I think was a... a judgment."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,439.847,441.395,"Yes, I think that's exactly right."
1999.99-224,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.072,483.733,"But just to explore this a little further, let's suppose the lawsuit was brought by the prisoners and it was determined by the court that the prison was putting six people in a single cell room that would properly hold only two and that it was a violation of the Constitution, making it cruel and unusual punishment, and further, that the prison was providing only 1,000 calories of food a day, whereas to sustain normal weight and life, 2,000 calories a day were required."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,524.649,528.082,"--Justice O'Connor, I... I think I would describe our position somewhat differently than that."
1999.99-224,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.568,559.193,"Well, you don't have to say anything."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,567.912,568.391,--Right.
1999.99-224,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.391,568.995,Okay.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,568.995,570.457,And that shifts the burden.
1999.99-224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.741,588.103,"Well, in... in your answer to Justice O'Connor that... that you just gave explaining the authority of the Congress to, for want of a better term, modify the terms of the decree, I kept waiting for you to use the term prospective."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,592.815,592.968,No.
1999.99-224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,593.793,594.745,--this is a prospective--
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,594.745,595.209,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.209,597.647,--operation of... of a statute.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,603.603,604.989,"That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.246,646.72,"--But, Mr. Laramore, it seems to me that in order for you to prevail, you have to establish the initial proposition that constitutional issues aside, which Congress lets the court resolve during that 90-day period... constitutional issues aside, Congress has the power to eliminate a remedy that has been prospectively imposed by a court."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,680.803,681.314,--Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.314,691.738,"And the statute specifically says, any injunctions already in effect, enjoining competition for the future, will be dissolved."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,694.371,704.193,Plainly I think the prospective portion of it applying to injunctions not yet issued is valid.
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.193,704.757,"Oh, sure."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,704.757,706.412,And then the question I think becomes--
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.412,706.537,Come on.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,706.689,728.612,"--a formalistic one whether... whether Congress may pass a law that says those injunctions are no longer valid as... as it did in the Telecommunications Act as to some of the existing injunctions, or whether it must do what it did in this case, which is to say, courts must evaluate those injunctions and apply the new standards to those injunctions but--"
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.612,734.317,"Well, I don't think it has the power to give the courts 90 days and say, if you don't do it in 90 days, they're no longer invalid unless it has the power to invalidate them."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,736.653,737.608,--Well--
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.608,740.9,And you're not willing to say that it has the power to invalidate them.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,740.9,750.861,"--It has the power to tell the... and again, this is... is perhaps too technical a way to express it."
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,758.746,764.253,"You answered my question to say that it was, once it's suspended, apart from the label."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,793.626,796.36,"Yes, as a matter of separation of powers."
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.36,803.367,"So, is there anything on... anything that's constitutionally required by giving the district court any time at all in your judgment?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,803.367,820.364,"Well, Judge Easterbrook says in... in his dissent that there may be a due process element involved here, although I suggest that that is not such an issue here as long as there are other methods that prisoners can use outside of this injunctive--"
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.364,820.914,"Well, I--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,820.914,822.136,--to vindicate their rights.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.136,835.339,"--prison litigation where the finding has been made not just that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment, but that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment in this and that and the other particular--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,835.339,835.725,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.725,837.802,--as Justice O'Connor spelled out.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,866.129,866.562,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,866.562,867.7,--specific ways.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,881.232,881.566,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.566,892.397,"But to say no matter how complex the case is, you have 30 days or 90 days, I don't know of any legislation like that, do you?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,896.522,901.821,There's no other statute that we've found that acts in that way on an existing judgment.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.821,902.268,--Yes.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,902.268,909.085,"There are, of course, other provisions with time limits that have consequences such as the Speedy Trial Act and pre-trial detention--"
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,909.085,910.255,"Yes, but the result of the Speedy Trial Act--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,910.255,910.703,--Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,910.703,911.698,--is the defendant can't be tried.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,916.67,926.794,But I do want to highlight two portions of the statute that seem to be missing from the example that... that you've given and that Justice O'Connor maybe began.
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.86,965.228,"Yes, but that doesn't really answer Justice O'Connor's problem because if your reading is correct, after 30 days, they could put six people in each cell, even though they only had two during the 4-year period."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,965.228,966.234,"Well, they could."
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.234,966.761,Isn't that right?
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,966.761,970.728,"There would be no injunction prohibiting it, but--"
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.728,972.611,"Well, that's my point."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,973.446,974.124,--They could do it.
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.586,998.099,"Yes, but until they get that provision back, the State could legally say, we'll put the six people back in the shell... in the... in the cell until we get the litigation resolved."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,998.099,1000.113,"Yes, but let me point out one other--"
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.113,1001.601,"They might not do it, but I'm just trying to think of the--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1001.601,1014.095,"--But one... one other thing about that, Justice Stevens, is that the standard of conduct is set in that judgment and that standard of conduct remains because the automatic stay doesn't erase the judgment."
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1039.949,1055.251,"--But it hasn't... Mr. Laramore, under the new standard, they have... they said it's unconstitutional, but they haven't said it's the least... that the... the order is the least intrusive way to do... to take care of it."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1055.251,1056.751,That's--
1999.99-224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.751,1061.238,Maybe it's unconstitutional but attrition or something like that.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1061.238,1078.49,"--Well, I... I understand the question, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think that that... that those requirements for narrowness and least intrusiveness go to the substantive constitutional finding that six people in a cell is unconstitutional."
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.49,1080.853,"No, but the point would be that six people may... say they put three in."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1080.853,1081.286,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.286,1084.609,And they would argue two was a broader remedy than necessary.
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1089.009,1090.3,"Yes, they could do that."
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.3,1090.889,And then fight about whether--
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1090.889,1094.577,"And that could be the subject of later litigation, but... but that's--"
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.577,1095.295,"--Well, they couldn't do that."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1099.511,1100.327,"--Well, that's... that's right."
1999.99-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.327,1107.704,"If it was unconstitutional, it would be unlawful, just as it would be unlawful if the injunction remained in effect to disobey the injunction."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1114.824,1122.652,"Yes, and I answered Justice Stevens' question the way I did with the understanding that three in a cell had not been adjudicated--"
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.652,1123.255,"Well, but there's an argument about it."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1132.431,1132.999,--That's correct.
1999.99-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.999,1133.254,Yes.
1999.99-224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1133.254,1142.017,"May I go back to your... your proposition that started this discussion, that somehow it's relevant that these decrees are at least 4 years old?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1167.845,1177.971,"In passing these portions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, Congress was addressing a problem that it perceived which was--"
1999.99-224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1177.971,1180.703,"Well, I... I don't want to be picky about your form."
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1190.27,1197.519,--I think that the answer to that is that that's a question of substantive law that Congress could alter.
1999.99-224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1199.471,1208.622,"Congress could pass a statute, for example, saying all decrees of... of a court of otherwise competent jurisdiction are presumed to be invalid?"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1208.622,1210.172,--Well--
1999.99-224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1210.172,1211.008,Unnecessary?
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1212.08,1222.272,"--Congress I think could go so far as to say in a prospective manner that injunctions in prison cases, for example, would expire after a particular period of time--"
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.272,1222.89,"Thank you, Mr.--"
1999.99-224,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1222.89,1224.145,--unless the contrary showing was made.
1999.99-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.145,1225.259,"--Thank you, Mr. Laramore."
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1227.657,1242.451,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.555,1373.628,But none of... none of these other examples that you allude to were enacted for the very purpose of inducing the court to which the stay applied to act quickly.
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1378.268,1378.617,That's--
1999.99-224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.617,1380.412,"I mean, the bankruptcy stay, for example."
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1387.839,1388.726,--No.
1999.99-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.304,1415.17,"Well, but I read the language in 3626(e)(2), any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief shall operate as a stay, as unambiguous."
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1426.22,1426.926,"Well, to--"
1999.99-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.926,1427.817,And that's automatic.
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1432.884,1437.827,"--Well, I think there is a... a serious constitutional question."
1999.99-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1437.827,1446.377,"You said that, but is there a violation if we read it as a clear intent by Congress to have it operate just the way the State says?"
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1446.377,1480.049,"Well, while we think it's difficult, on balance, as we've said in our... in our brief, we think that it can be constitutionally defended because it operates only on prospective relief and this Court's precedents permit a change in law to affect prospective relief even in what is otherwise a final decree, an injunctive decree, and because it doesn't--"
1999.99-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1480.049,1488.712,--examples of... a congressional interference that would be upheld.
1999.99-224,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1488.712,1505.81,"--Well, Wheeling Bridge is an... is the sort of the classic example of a case in which there was a final decree prohibiting... initially requiring the taking down of the bridge, and then it would have been... would... prohibited its... its rebuilding."
1999.99-224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.81,1513.383,"Of course, there... there it was almost like a property right, a navigation servitude that the United States had the... could surrender at its will anyway."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2444.817,2449.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-224,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2463.989,2466.514,But you will... it's not a judgment at law.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2475.934,2477.075,"--Of course, that is correct."
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2505.608,2507.408,May... may I interrupt you here?
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2507.408,2507.691,--Yes.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2507.691,2513.307,"What if the... the point that you referred to were not, we'll say, 90 days?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2526.773,2536.664,"I think there would still be a question under Plaut because you would still be taking a final judgment at some point and saying... Congress stepping in and saying, we are modifying it."
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2537.174,2541.986,You would also be giving what I think most of us would assume would be an adequate opportunity--
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2541.986,2542.484,--Exactly.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.484,2546.154,--to review the continuing necessity for even a very complicated decree.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2546.154,2546.711,Exactly.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2546.711,2556.572,"So, you could say in... in the 2-year example, that... that it was in fact operating simply as a rule for default of... of a perfectly appropriate judicial process."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2556.572,2564.27,"Yes, and if you... and we view... we view the separation of powers as a functional test, is Congress invading the central prerogative of the courts."
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2573.142,2573.583,No.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2576.463,2578.788,"--Well, yes, it does, but it also boils down--"
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2578.788,2580.043,It's a fact question.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2604.015,2605.827,"--Well, that's correct."
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2615.208,2615.566,True.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2625.971,2626.479,--I think--
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2626.479,2628.438,--if the court is simply inactive.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2628.438,2629.989,--I think it will be much more problematic.
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.016,2635.008,"Why do you say more... you're talking about due process then, not separation of powers."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2645.396,2646.232,"--No, I don't think so."
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.268,2653.867,"Exactly, but that's not just what you told Justice Souter."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2668.753,2678.798,"--And I think... I think obviously the more time Congress gives, the less chance there is there are going to be problems and the more we're going to want to give Congress that limited ability to enter into--"
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.798,2679.525,You're going back again.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2688.463,2688.905,--There is--
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.905,2690.581,--assuming the situation arises.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2690.581,2690.966,--That's correct.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.212,2698.391,"Well, if... if Congress... if... take the 2-year example again."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2727.547,2727.721,--No.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2727.721,2728.093,Okay.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2742.977,2743.123,Yes.
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2743.123,2752.5,"So, I take it it would follow on... on your own argument that there would not be a separation of powers problem in that case."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2752.5,2755.137,"Well, it depends what happens after the 2 years."
1999.99-224,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2755.137,2771.812,"At... at the end of the 2 years, Congress, in effect, is saying, if you, court, do not engage in a review for current necessity, which we're giving you plenty of time, 2 years, to do, then there will be a default rule."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2788.483,2791.328,"If it is applied retroactively to existing judgments, yes."
1999.99-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.826,2813.285,"But to simply carry over from Plaut, which was not an equitable decree, as I... to equitable decrees which have been traditionally revisable--"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2813.285,2813.675,Yes.
1999.99-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.675,2816.177,--it seems to me is not an automatic step.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2816.177,2817.643,"Well, they are revisable with new law."
1999.99-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.057,2826.53,"Well, I don't know that Wheeling Bridge is as clear as you say about the Congress having enacted a new law."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2829.745,2844.771,"--But... but still, if we look at Plaut, there was a concern of this Court's opinion in Plaut of what was happening at the time, both before and after the passage of the Constitution, with State legislatures sitting as super courts either directly reviewing judgments or passing legislation."
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.524,2869.223,"Yes, but... but they didn't make distinctions between... between new legislation... new legislative action that involve what you call substantive law and new legislative action that alters the remedies available for courts."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2904.111,2915.426,"--Because if Congress says to a court, you must suspend or even terminate this order, period, I don't think Congress is functioning as Congress."
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.977,2930.145,"--But it can change the substantive law and say, you... you may not enforce this decree in the future because we're changing... we've decided we're going to change the law on you, that... that you... that was the basis for the decree?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2930.145,2932.144,"Of course, it can and that's the function of Congress."
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.144,2945.756,"I don't see why you say of course for the one and not of course for... it's also the function of Congress... just as it is to enact substantive law, it is a function of Congress to enact laws prescribing the remedial powers of the courts within constitutional limits."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2949.777,2950.12,But--
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.12,2956.052,Isn't that a fully legitimate legislative power of Congress?
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2956.052,2957.917,--But (e)(2) does not do anything.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2960.365,2960.922,I thought it did.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2965.044,2965.044,Sure.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.044,2970.792,"--is that Congress introduced a new standard for all cases, and... or they thought it was new."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2974.112,2974.271,That's correct.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.271,2978.939,--and you can't go beyond the... and it say that... you can't go beyond the Federal right that's infringed.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2982.043,2982.695,That's correct.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.695,2986.312,"And it also applies to those in the old cases, but only in the future."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2998.92,3001.589,"Well, that's how (b)(2) works, but that's not how (e)(2) works."
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3009.751,3010.093,"Oh, yes."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3010.093,3010.702,--the situation was--
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.702,3016.349,"So, but now... that's... that's the automatic stay, of course, which is the substance here, the issue."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3039.05,3040.163,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.923,3052.104,"In other words, if you adopt the SG's interpretation of the words, shall operate as an automatic stay, then in your opinion is there still a constitutional problem?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3052.104,3054.937,"--No, but we do not feel that the statute is that pliable."
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.959,3058.296,Why isn't it that pliable?
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3083.782,3089.024,--The purpose of the statute is to circumscribe the district court's discretion as greatly as possible.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.024,3100.308,"Well, it's... well, is there anything in the legislative history that suggests that the SG's interpretation, which is consistent with the language, is not what Congress intended?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3100.308,3107.748,"Well, the 1995 conference report discusses the fact that this was designed to make judges rule more promptly."
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.1,3109.727,"Well, more... absolutely."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3119.919,3135.381,"--But the legislative history I believe... and there's not a... there's not a lot of legislative history, but the legislative history is replete with examples brought by prison officials and by representatives themselves of what they deem to be improper interference by courts."
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.381,3135.528,Exactly.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3148.657,3162.676,"But again, given that... given that legislative history and given that the purpose of the statute in the larger sense is to circumscribe the discretion of these courts, which Congress clearly from the legislative history felt was running amuck in some sense, it would--"
1999.99-224,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.676,3171.968,"Mr. Falk, do you know in... in this connection whether there is an automatic stay provision like this one?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3201.427,3203.035,"--I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.53,3226.53,What's wrong with that?
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3247.847,3252.012,I do not think Congress could pass that law with regard to judgments that have already been entered.
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3258.825,3259.784,Yes.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3262.927,3276.151,"And in light of that, we think this is a violation of the separation of powers under Plaut because Congress has commanded the reopening of a judgment in violation of the separation of powers."
1999.99-224,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3290.357,3295.304,"Well, it really doesn't affect the determination of the violation, does it?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3298.388,3298.539,No.
1999.99-224,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3298.539,3302.749,--by a court that there's been a constitutional violation is not affected.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3302.749,3303.575,"No, but the court--"
1999.99-224,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3303.575,3314.124,"What is affected if its upheld is the remedial power of the court, not the substantive holding of the violation."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3321.658,3323.366,--It would wipe out the remedy that had been ordered.
1999.99-224,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3342.302,3356.218,"Unless the court determines that the relief meets the remedial standard adopted by Congress, that it is narrowly tailored and no greater than necessary, and so forth."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3356.218,3356.726,That's correct.
1999.99-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.691,3372.371,"Well, you're not suggesting, are you, Mr. Falk, that Congress can't make rules regarding the injunctive authority of... of courts?"
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3374.793,3392.67,"--No, we are not saying that at all, but if you look at Norris-LaGuardia and if you look at TROs, what you're dealing with there is Congress saying we're giving you 5 days, 10 days, whatever, after which you, court... the temporary order, the ex parte order, whatever goes away, but you, court, you can still function as a court."
1999.99-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.166,3411.724,"I... I thought you had said a moment earlier that Congress was just very, very limited in dealing with what you referred to as the central authority of... of the courts."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3417.066,3424.933,"--Well, but even in the context of Norris-LaGuardia or temporary restraining orders, Congress still gives the court the power to act as a court."
1999.99-224,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3426.591,3432.715,"Mr. Falk, I don't understand the analogy between the TRO and Norris-LaGuardia, these short-life orders."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3465.625,3466.317,--Of course.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3485.626,3485.876,Yes.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3485.876,3487.894,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3487.894,3488.318,Finish it.
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3488.318,3488.845,I'm sorry.
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.407,3498.342,"Mr. Falk, I come back to your... your objection."
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3529.674,3531.924,I think that would be a problem--
1999.99-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3531.924,3537.454,The only thing Congress could do in that situation was to amend the substantive telecommunications law?
1999.99-224,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3537.454,3540.795,"--To the extent... yes, to the extent that they were acting retroactively."
