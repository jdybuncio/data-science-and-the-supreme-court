1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.976,We'll hear arguments next in Arkansas against Sanders.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,78.928,79.185,Thank you.
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,151.355,155.978,What are the exigent circumstances here that distinguish it from Chadwick?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,157.013,172.076,"Mr. Justice, I think we're clearly talking apples and oranges and I think, in Chadwick, this Court made it extremely plain, mentioning several times, that it did not deal with nor was it confronted with an automobile exception search."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,270.837,284.157,"General Purvis, if I understand your theory correctly, in Chadwick you would say the automobile exception would've applied if the agents have waited a few moments until they put the footlocker into the trunk of the car and then started the motor."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,284.686,290.292,"I think it possibly would've, but I think, certainly, when you are speaking of a 200-pound double lock footlocker --"
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.292,292.177,"Well, it still would've fit in the trunk, I think."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,292.177,292.979,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.979,296.301,"And if they'd started the motor, it'd be precisely like this car."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,306.198,308.259,"What you had, Mr. Justice --"
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.259,314.91,"But, is this a question of a different point in time when the officers chose to make the search, isn't that the only difference?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,314.91,315.044,"No, s --"
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.044,319.818,"They could've -- presumably, they knew about the description of the luggage when they put it in the trunk here."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,325.171,336.804,"I don't think that the of -- there was any way, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the officers here really could have made the search and seizure at that time because of the particular facts of this situation."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.769,345.212,Yes.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,345.212,350.615,"Alright, there was no corroboration -- no full corroboration until he picked up the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.615,351.899,"Yes, but then there was."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,351.899,356.118,"But, Mr. Sanders then meets up with a confederate."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.465,387.697,"Well, when he picked the suitcase up, they could've seized it right then, couldn't they?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,387.697,389.306,You're also dealing with a situation where the officer --
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.306,390.313,Couldn't they?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,390.313,390.514,Were physically --
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.514,395.364,"Could they not have picked and seized the suitcase when he picked it up, right at the moment you just described?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,395.364,400.639,"I think, also, the officers were far enough away physically that they cou -- they probably could not have gotten to it."
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.323,434.611,"Well, Mr. Purvis, these facts you've described, so far, make this sound like a much more -- kind of a fluid situations and not really the classical automobile search exception when we knew you've got a taxi."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,434.611,453.113,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't think the fact that it is a taxicab as opposed to an individual's private vehicle, I don't see anything in the automobile requirement that says we will grant an automobile exception as to taxicabs but we -- or as to private vehicles, but we won't as to taxicabs."
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.203,506.137,"Why wouldn't that -- I can see how that might give them probable cause to seize the suitcase, but how about searching at an opening right on the spot?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,506.137,518.583,"I think you have had exactly the same thing and, arguably, a lesser intrusion into the privacy of the owner of the goods and the owner of the vehicle and what not than you would in the Carroll case because --"
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.583,530.927,"How can you say you'll search in the vehicle, which is a taxicab, when you're searching a bag which the taxi company doesn't own, the taxi driver doesn't own?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,533.266,534.675,You are searching the suitcase --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.675,534.783,Right.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,534.783,535.875,"But, it is an intrical part."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.875,536.185,And I --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,536.185,536.927,There is no --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.927,541.88,Does the respondent complain about the search into the cab?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,541.88,542.866,Does the respondent?
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,542.866,543.161,Yes.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,545.068,546.663,"Apparently he does not, no."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.663,550.568,"So, why do you keep saying that they had the right to search the cab?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,550.568,562.913,"Because if you want to take the crux of the argument further, and essentially what the issue is here, we do not think that Chadwick applies to restrict officers who are making a legitimate automobile exception search."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,562.913,566.204,You take that and you search all beings and you search everything in it and open it up?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,566.204,568.088,"I think certainly, that they have a right to that."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.088,571.887,Including a double-locked locker?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,571.887,580.087,I would question as to the distinction of the right of privacy between an individual as to the contents of his actual seats of the car raised in peril.
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,580.087,586.223,"If there was a double-locked trunk in a car, could you search it?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,586.223,587.205,"I think, possibly, you could."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,587.205,589.561,By opening the lock and breaking the lock?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,589.561,591.625,"I think, possibly, you could."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,591.625,594.311,And that wouldn't hurt Chadwick at all?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,594.311,595.024,"No, sir, because I think --"
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.024,595.812,Just ignore it?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,595.812,596.699,I think as long as you are --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.699,597.809,Just ignore it?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,597.809,598.226,"No, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.425,605.316,I don't like to ask which one is apple and which is orange.
1978.77-1497,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,605.316,608.232,"General, the suitcase in this case was unlocked, wasn't it?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,608.232,610.323,"Yes, sir, it was."
1978.77-1497,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,610.323,612.939,"In your view, does that make a difference so far as Chadwick is concerned?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,612.939,617.257,I think it certainly is a criteria to be considered along with the totality of the facts.
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,652.973,653.568,Excuse me.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,655.57,658.28,"No, I said they -- “popped” is a really colloquial term."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,658.28,659.198,"Excuse me, I missed --"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,659.198,659.514,I'm sorry I used that.
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,659.514,662.148,I misunderstood that.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,662.148,668.157,"But, they opened the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,745.99,753.245,Is it your submission that there was probable cause not only to search but at the time that there was probable cause to arrest --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,753.245,753.413,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.413,754.318,The occupants of the cab?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,754.318,784.227,"And, I think there was probable cause to rest on the suspicion and I think, when the officers observed the contents of that suitcase, which I think under the circumstances of this particular case, was a very minimal or probably a far minimal privacy intrusion than it would have been to have arrested the cab driver and the two occupants thereof and have driven all of them down to the police station and waited at least two hours while some magistrate was hunted up and a warrant was obtained."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,784.227,786.195,And where was the suitcase in the cab?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,786.195,787.779,Suitcase was in the trunk of the cab.
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,787.779,788.595,In the trunk.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,793.631,793.778,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.778,794.872,Search incident to allow for it.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,794.872,795.766,"And, we try --"
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,795.766,798.573,I was thinking about the Rios case which involved a taxicab.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,806.489,811.296,I must confess that I'm not really familiar with it.
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.296,826.238,"General Purvis, let me go back to a question the Chief Justice asked you about what were the exigent circumstances and to the Supreme Court of Arkansas' opinion, they say, with the suitcase safely immobilized, it was -- there was no risk that the evidence might be lost."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,828.438,855.807,"As I reiterated before, and let me preference this, Mr. Justice Stevens, with the remark that I think it seems to me quite obvious, that the Arkansas Supreme Court was so bound and determined to fit the facts of this case within the ambit of Chadwick that it did everything it could, including inventing and misconstruing argument on behalf of the state try to shoehorn the facts within that case."
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.807,859.443,"That may be, but I didn't really hear your answer to the Chief Justice's question."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,861.179,861.298,I --
1978.77-1497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.298,862.716,What were the exigent circumstances?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,862.716,885.404,"I think, sir, that the exigent circumstances were that you have a defendant and a just met confederate who are in a moving vehicle who are moving away from the airport in rush hour traffic, 5:00 on a Friday afternoon, after the Courts have closed to a point unknown on one of the busiest streets in town."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.338,890.628,For opening the bag?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,890.628,891.165,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.165,892.709,Or for stopping the cab?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,892.709,894.46,I think both because I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.46,898.75,"Well, what were the exigent circumstances why they couldn't have carried the bag to the police --"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,898.75,899.343,I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.343,900.232,Station or some place?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,900.232,917.712,"Mr. Justice Marshall, that under the facts here where you have, as we contend, a legitimate automobile search, that given the language of Chambers v. Maroney, there is no constitutional difference between a search -- warrantless search at the scene and taking the individuals all back to the police station."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,917.712,920.15,"Well, why couldn't you have gotten a warrant?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,920.15,926.948,"There couldn't have been a warrant obtained at which juncture, after the search, before the search?"
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,926.948,928.541,At any time.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,928.541,928.903,There could --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.903,930.207,That's a whole lot of leeway.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,930.207,931.188,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,936.063,937.134,"Alright, well, after that?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,937.134,938.281,Were facts.
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.047,951.045,"When this chase was over and the car, the motor had cooled off, could they have gotten the warrant then?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,951.045,954.278,"Well, sir, I don't believe the motor had cooled off by the time they had done the search."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,954.278,957.973,"Well, if the motor was still hot, could they have gotten it then?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,957.973,959.072,"They could have, Your Honor, but I --"
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,959.072,960.248,"Well, why didn't they?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,960.248,960.332,I do not --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.332,962.17,What was the exigent circumstance --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,962.17,962.382,I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,962.382,963.432,-- could not get in there?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,963.432,972.543,"It goes back to the fact that, given a valid auto search, the exigent circumstances do not immediately vanish when you have stopped the individual."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,972.543,976.284,Or you could search anything then?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,976.284,984.405,"Our point is that, given an automobile exception, that it naturally extends to the contents of the vehicle."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.405,988.494,You could have broken open a safe?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,988.494,995.407,"If it were -- I think, if it were within an automobile --"
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.407,995.715,General Purvis --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,995.715,999.971,And you were there pursuant to a legitimate exception search.
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.971,1008.694,You don't suggest there are any more exigent circumstances here than would be -- than would accompany an ordinary automobile search.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1016.854,1027.833,"I think, to a certain extent, Mr. Justice White, there has to be a determination made by officers who are there at the scene based upon their practical experience or not."
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.833,1035.137,"Yes, but Carroll and Chambers are saying that you can search a car on probable cause without a warrant."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1037.009,1037.372,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.372,1048.194,"You could stop it and you don't stop in every individual case to decide whether there are exigent circumstances in that particular case, do you?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1048.194,1050.654,"No, sir, but I think that the cases seem to make --"
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.654,1053.911,But is this -- does this one have any more exigent circumstances than the --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1053.911,1060.783,"I think, under the facts, I cannot recite more exigent circumstances."
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.783,1078.991,"Well, I had understood you to say that the police, in effect, had two or three balls bouncing in the air at one time and that, for that reason, it was a stronger case than the ordinary automobile search case with the confederate, the suitcase, and the person in the cab."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1078.991,1080.414,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1080.414,1085.726,"It seems to me, your real answer is that if it's within the automobile exception, as you contend, you don't need exigent circumstances."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1085.726,1086.609,No.
1978.77-1497,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1086.609,1087.577,"It seems to me, that's the argument you should be making."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.577,1090.105,The moving automobile makes for the exigent circumstance.
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.105,1091.446,That is the exigent circumstance?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1091.446,1092.037,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1092.037,1093.751,A moving automobile on a highway or street?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1093.751,1108.459,"Forgive me for not going into that, but this Court has noted time and time again that, given a moving automobile, that the probable cause to believe that it contains contraband is the real touchstone with the Fourth Amendment."
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.459,1112.086,"Do you think if you could get into a locked house, you could get into a locked suitcase in a trunk?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1112.086,1128.003,"Yes, sir, and I think to hold anything otherwise would create, as the Ninth Circuit held in Finnegan, would create wholly a logical results or it would, as we contend, totally emasculate the automobile exception because you get into a situation."
1978.77-1497,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1170.379,1175.431,"General Purvis, aren't there really two kinds of situations that might possibly call for different rules?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1192.425,1203.708,"Yes, sir, I think you can because I think, to do otherwise, you tend to focus the Fourth Amendment away from the right of privacy and toward places and things."
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.708,1214.292,"Well, what if your -- what if there's been a piano stolen and you stop a truck and you want to search for -- see if the truck's got the piano in it?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1216.993,1222.287,"I think, for anyone to expect that a piano would be stuffed in a glove compartment would be rather ludicrous."
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.287,1224.717,"So your answer is no, or not?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1224.717,1225.085,I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.085,1228.923,"Say, you've got probable cause to stop the truck to search for the piano."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1228.923,1230.546,I think you probably could.
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.546,1233.593,"Well, why can't -- why, if he's got probable cause to search for a piano?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1233.593,1233.748,I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.748,1235.117,Why can't you get into the glove compartment?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1235.117,1241.404,"I think when you're talking glove compartment, you arguably bring in some new exceptions to the Fourth Amendment."
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1242.075,1249.008,How about the Terry aspect that you might want to search in the glove compartment to see if the driver had a 45-automatic?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1249.008,1251.822,"Indeed, and --"
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1251.822,1253.797,Which he could get in the glove compartment.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1253.797,1254.88,Exactly.
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1254.88,1259.444,Which he couldn't get if it was in the trunk.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1259.444,1259.826,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.293,1263.544,I know.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1265.294,1265.94,"No, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1269.663,1276.259,The answer to me that it's apples and oranges is pretty in effective in that you talk old apples and old oranges.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1276.259,1276.88,"Yes, sir?"
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1276.88,1291.86,"Now, as I understand it, once you stop it, once you have a reason to stop the vehicle, you have the right to search everything in -- everybody and everything in that vehicle."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1291.86,1293.258,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.258,1304.714,"So, if you were looking for a diamond ring, you have the right to rip open the suitcase in the trunk, wouldn't you?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1304.714,1305.852,"I think, possibly, you would."
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.506,1310.501,"I imagine, the shoes?"
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.501,1310.918,What about comp --
1978.77-1497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.918,1313.787,There's no restrictions at all.
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.787,1317.0,What about probable cause to arrest someone in the vehicle?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1326.367,1330.246,I think you could really proceed really under either theory.
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.246,1347.334,"Well, do you think if you simply have probable cause to stop a vehicle because you had reason to believe that a suspect was in the vehicle without any additional evidence, you could search the trunk, get out a suitcase, and search the suitcase?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1347.334,1347.406,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.406,1358.506,"Although, perhaps the person that you were -- had probable cause to arrest was thought to be fleeing a suspect and has no connection with the suitcase?"
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1358.506,1376.926,"I certainly think you can and I think that that situation, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is extremely analogous to the situation in Chambers where the officers had probable cause to believe that that vehicle contained four men who fit the description of the robbers of a store, and that was the reason that they stopped."
1978.77-1497,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1391.304,1396.742,May I be sure I understand your answer to Mr. Justice White's hypothetical about a truck containing a piano.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1396.742,1397.756,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1397.756,1401.208,Do you take the position that that would authorize a search of the glove compartment?
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1401.208,1408.13,"Yes, sir, and I think it could also be authorized and probably would better be authorized in that situation as a search incident to --"
1978.77-1497,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1408.13,1409.594,"No, just the automobile exception."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1421.013,1424.266,"That's carrying it to an extreme, but I think --"
1978.77-1497,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1424.266,1431.062,"Well, you have an extreme view."
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1431.062,1441.648,Do you relate this again to the Terry concept that you're entitled to make a prophylactic search to see if there's a 45-automatic in the --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1441.648,1442.039,I think --
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.039,1442.075,Somewhere in the position --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1442.075,1443.936,The search of the glove box --
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1443.936,1444.785,Somewhere in the possession --
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1444.785,1446.454,Would be far more akin to that.
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1446.454,1449.701,Under the seat of the driver and so forth.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1449.701,1450.132,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.132,1459.375,It certainly takes the position from your predicate that you can search the driver himself to see whether he had a 45-automatic somewhere.
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1459.375,1483.221,"It seems to me, to -- something to be remembered here is that this Court has also repeatedly held that those who occupy an automobile moving on the highway operate under a diminished expectation of privacy, and to hold that it is the automobile itself which enjoys that diminished expectation of privacy, I think is frivolous."
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1489.4,1493.577,"I think I should tell you, you're into, I think, four minutes of your rebuttal that you wanted to save."
1978.77-1497,0,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1493.577,1498.159,"Alright, I will save the rest for rebuttal, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1500.754,1508.916,Mr. Lassiter.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1508.916,1511.105,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.184,1565.722,At what point?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1565.722,1575.752,"When the cab is stopped and Mr. Sanders is placed under arrest, and then the trunk is opened and the suitcase itself is seized, removed from the trunk of the cab."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.752,1579.555,Why could they get into the trunk?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1579.555,1593.632,"Well, I have not argued that they didn't have probable cause to open the trunk and seize the suitcase itself, just that that they could not then enter the suitcase without prior judicial authorization."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.632,1603.101,"Well, assume there's a -- assume there's probable -- at least let's just assume there's probable cause to believe that there was contraband or something in the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1603.101,1603.882,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.882,1609.491,"And -- so, there was probable cause to stop the cab."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1620.381,1620.822,Well --
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.822,1625.861,"Certainly, why not get -- have to get a warrant to get into the trunk?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1625.861,1636.541,"I think you could certainly argue that and maybe I'm arguing against my position a little bit, but the Fourth Amendment analysis based -- is based on the expectation of privacy."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.662,1652.915,And the trunk?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1652.915,1655.091,"Well, the lower Courts have in the past."
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1672.184,1674.68,But only the cab driver has standing there.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.68,1675.338,That's the cab driver.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1675.338,1677.294,Only the cab driver has standing to object opening the trunk --
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1677.294,1677.944,That's correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1677.944,1678.596,And he consented here.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1678.596,1681.99,That is what I was about to get to here and now.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.237,1704.638,"But the officers had a perfect right to take that trunk -- that suitcase out of the trunk, don't you admit that?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1704.638,1705.361,I think so.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.767,1708.891,But not to open it?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1708.891,1709.548,Correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.548,1726.681,"What if the police had probable cause to believe that there were some sort of a loaded weapon in the suitcase or something to that effect, do you think they would have a right to open it on the spot rather than carted it on for a couple of hours until they could get it to a magistrate?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1726.681,1730.488,"Well, it's certainly not in the Chimel wings braid is into the truck."
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.676,1742.762,He couldn't get access to it pers -- the police could've presented -- prevented him from getting access to it without having opening on the spot.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1742.762,1743.489,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1743.489,1744.541,Couldn't the police have put in the back and --
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1744.541,1745.925,The transcript is quite clear on that.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.925,1747.568,Couldn't they put it in the back of their car?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1747.568,1748.226,Certainly.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1748.226,1749.639,And lock it with their key?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1749.639,1750.787,Certainly.
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.787,1766.148,But wha -- isn't there some re -- something to be said for the idea that the police shouldn't be obligated to carry around for several hours a trunk which they have probable cause to believe has a weapon in it without being able to open it?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1766.148,1775.876,"Well, what they very simply could do with it, what the LRPD would do with it is take it back to the station house and put it in the property range so it would not go anywhere then and nobody is going to get back there to get the weapon."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.471,1792.38,"Suppose you arrest a man on the street whom you've got probable cause to arrest or you've got a warrant for his arrest, and he's carrying a suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1797.609,1801.082,Only if Chimel were to apply to the fact situation.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.082,1802.737,"Well, he's got it in his hands."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1804.045,1804.808,"Alright, what if they arrest him --"
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.808,1806.121,He's right on the street.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1806.121,1814.545,"And they handcuff him and the suitcase is then standing by his side where he can't possibly get into it, I think maybe that's a case-by-case determination, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.709,1830.077,"I didn't say whether there was probable cause to -- does it make any difference, in your answer to my question, whether there was probable cause to think there was anything in the suitcase?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1830.077,1833.256,If there is probable cause to arrest the individual --
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.256,1833.762,Yes?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1833.762,1838.349,"And Chimel justifies the entry, they could go ahead into the suitcase to look for weapon to protect themselves."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.349,1844.006,"So, your answer is, no, it doesn't make any difference whether they have probable cause to think there's anything in the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1844.006,1849.231,"That would be correct, as long as the suitcase is within his wingspread."
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1862.691,1873.954,"Mr. Lassiter, I take it from what you've said that you think the proper procedure would've been for the police to take the suitcase to headquarters and obtain a warrant there."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1873.954,1874.644,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1874.644,1875.429,Is that correct?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1875.429,1882.612,"They could've taken Mr. Sanders back at that time, along with the suitcase, and they could've held him while they procured a warrant."
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1882.612,1896.791,"Yes, but I -- do you agree that there would've been sufficient probable cause for the magistrate to issue a warrant?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1901.296,1921.771,"I hesitated answering that because I had some questions after reading the transcript as to where the informant had received his information, whether it really reached the requirements of Spinelli and Aguilar, but that has been conceded far below, I guess, that probable cause was present."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.973,1925.763,You didn't concede a moment ago that they could seize the suitcase.
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.763,1928.296,"Yes, I think he did."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.296,1930.241,Which would require probable cause.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1930.241,1940.594,"Yes, what I'm saying is I'm not raising that here and, for purposes of our argument, we can't concede that they did have probable cause to seize the suitcase and that a warrant would have been issued."
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1940.594,1954.401,"And, if the suitcase in fact had been empty of any contraband, in other words if there was nothing incriminating in it, your client would've been more inconvenienced by having it taken to the station house --"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1954.401,1954.561,It certainly would.
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1954.561,1956.16,And having it opened on the spot.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1956.16,1961.017,"It certainly would have, and he could also have sit on the spot, “I don't want to go down to the station house."
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.227,1964.479,“And I'll open it for you.”
1978.77-1497,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1964.479,1968.588,Is there as privacy interest in contraband?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1968.588,1969.093,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2012.102,2012.875,Mr. Lassiter.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2012.875,2013.707,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.707,2018.821,We've been talking about the automobile exception.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2031.299,2031.932,"Yes, it is."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.095,2049.435,"Let me pursue that by saying, to take the illustration, the hypothetical Justice White posed, about the highjacked truck which has stolen a piano and the driver is part of that operation."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2059.391,2061.324,If the car is stolen and the driver is --
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.324,2062.085,"No, not stolen."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2083.404,2089.786,"If they're looking for the piano, then you can't look for an elephant in a matchbox, I think somebody told me in law school one time."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.245,2117.896,Wouldn't the concept of Terry indicate that you could make that prophylactic search?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2126.892,2128.049,"Yes, and that would again --"
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.049,2129.502,Attack the officers.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2129.502,2130.907,"Yes, and I would agree with that."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2133.964,2143.096,"So, when you stop the truck with the piano, you can search the entire truck to see if there's a weapon."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2143.096,2145.872,"Well, that'd depend on what have been done with the driver."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.083,2173.05,"Well, you can't have the rule of law applicable depending on the sequence of events, whether they took the man -- the driver in handcuffs before they had determined that he had the stolen piano."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2184.414,2211.452,"Your Honor, I'm not sure that that -- I'm not sure that the Court wants to tell law enforcement officers that any time they stop an individual when there's probable cause of arrest and then not probable cause for search of the automobile, that the officers can go in and completely search the interior of the automobile, once the driver has been removed from access to the automobile --"
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2211.452,2219.363,"Hasn't the Court gone beyond that in Terry, among other cases, that not only -- in Terry, they could search the person."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2219.363,2219.898,Correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.898,2225.118,"Which, is a much greater invasion of privacy than searching the glove compartment."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2225.118,2231.481,"And, we justify that because the police need to protect themselves by searching the person, and we did that same thing in Robinson."
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.19,2327.547,"Mr. Lassiter, it just occurred to me that if we treat this as an automobile exception case and therefore you have an objection raised by two passengers to the search or one passenger, I don't think your client has standing to object to the search of the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2327.547,2328.804,Rakas.
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.804,2332.311,Yes.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2332.311,2355.796,"Rakas says that the passenger in the automobile does not have standing to raise the motion to suppress if he -- if the car doesn't belong to him and he does not exhibit any sort of proprietary interest in that item which the state is seeking to introduce into evidence, the Court rejecting the target theory."
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.756,2364.117,"Well, when you -- when a passenger gets into a taxicab, the car portend does belong to him."
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.671,2369.026,"It's his suitcase, too."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2369.026,2376.239,That's correct and that that would be -- I'm moving to hopefully distinguishing the standing problem here.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2393.752,2396.758,"Not unless he paid for the cab fare, I don't think."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2396.758,2397.681,Your Honor?
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2397.681,2405.126,"Not unless he paid the fare, under Rakas that is."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2405.126,2412.947,"And, secondly here, in Sanders, the contraband in the cab is the crux of the charge."
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.78,2468.748,"Well, he also presumably rented the suitc -- rented the trunk as well as the space he was riding in for the purposes of that particular trip."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2468.748,2483.292,Certainly.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.659,2530.496,"Well, if there's a weapon and if there is a reason putting a lock, could anybody ask?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2530.496,2539.635,That would be correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.561,2671.906,"Say, you arrested a man on the street with probable cause or with a warrant and he's carrying a suitcase and it's locked, and a -- you search him and you find a sealed envelope in his inside pocket."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2676.789,2681.076,"It would appear, under Terry --"
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.076,2681.756,Under Terry?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2688.307,2693.872,"Unless the envelope seemed to contain a weapon, I don't think you could justify it."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.872,2700.127,What if it was bulky enough to have a few thousand dollars worth of heroine?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2700.127,2700.859,"Well, that --"
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.859,2704.674,It might be in several government bonds or it might be some heroine.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2705.672,2707.557,"I think so, under Robinson."
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.586,2711.947,You can search anything on the guy's person.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2711.947,2713.11,"I believe, yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.843,2728.755,But you can't search a suitcase and examine it.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2728.755,2728.826,Right.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.826,2733.002,"It's just a different antici -- expectation of privacy, I gather."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2733.002,2733.232,The --
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.232,2733.953,Is that your rationale?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2733.953,2737.709,There is no justification for the warrantless entry into it.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.546,2741.371,Into the envelope?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2741.371,2741.401,Yes.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.401,2743.395,Into the sealed envelope?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2743.395,2745.958,"I think, under Robinson, you would."
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.945,2751.698,Is it true that there's no constitutional issue involved?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2761.553,2762.208,I think the Offerman case is --
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.208,2766.549,There's no litigation about it.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2772.596,2774.839,"Well, I don't agree that it's alright."
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.707,2783.4,"You mean, when a man is arrested he can't be searched before he's put in jail?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2783.4,2783.941,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.705,2787.456,I hope you don't.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2787.456,2787.731,No.
1978.77-1497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.868,2791.907,He can be searched.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2791.907,2793.416,"Alright, the -- that's correct."
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2795.128,2798.055,Within the limits of Chimel.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2798.055,2798.269,"Yes, and --"
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2798.269,2798.978,After a lawful arrest.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2798.978,2804.79,Robinson and Terry in the cases that talk about the search incident to arrest of the individual.
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.134,2840.448,"Of course, what about the other things on the spectrum?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2852.18,2852.724,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.777,2891.995,I suppose your suitcase had a locked container inside it.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2895.043,2897.906,"No, I think one warrant would be sufficient to --"
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.906,2904.107,"You can go through even six locked containers, each within the other, on one warrant."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2904.107,2905.327,"Yes, I think so."
1978.77-1497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.535,2917.581,Yes.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,2917.581,2923.361,I don't think there would be a necessity of a series of warrants.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3005.996,3010.671,"Mr. Purvis, assume that the police had probable cause to -- I'm sorry."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3011.457,3012.566,Alright.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3012.566,3015.444,Assume that the police had -- I got your name wrong.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3042.687,3043.467,No.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3043.467,3043.913,You would not?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3043.913,3046.142,I would not.
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3046.868,3048.664,Because you don't know whether it's in the luggage or not.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3050.456,3054.958,"Okay, let's assume that -- let's assume you have probable cause here."
1978.77-1497,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3071.406,3076.814,"But the problem, I suppose, would be that they would not have probable cause to believe it was within any particular suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3090.422,3098.375,"Well, I'm not sure that we want them to enter the luggage unless they do have a warrant."
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3134.434,3135.27,"Mr. Lassiter, the --"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3135.27,3138.008,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.008,3144.593,"You concede, I guess, at least for purposes of this argument that there was probable cause to arrest these people, was there?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3144.593,3145.539,Correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3145.539,3154.729,"And, if there was and they were in a moving car, certainly, the arrest would have to be accomplished right then and there and they would've had to be -- the people would've had to be removed from the car."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3154.729,3155.345,Correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3155.345,3172.042,"And, also, the -- you concede, since there was probable cause to arrest and there was probable cause to search, there was probable cause to search the car without a warrant under Carroll Doctrine and, therefore, to remove the suitcase from the car."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3172.042,3173.385,To seize and remove.
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.385,3174.325,Seize and remove.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3181.758,3184.762,Correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.762,3188.176,"But, there, you say there was a warrant needed to open up the suitcase."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3188.176,3191.381,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.381,3194.817,"That's the limited and rather narrow question of this case, isn't it?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3194.817,3195.434,That's correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.434,3205.186,"Well, wouldn't you say that you'd have to have a separate probable cause to warrant -- to get the warrant to get into the suitcase?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3205.186,3206.813,"Well, certainly, we need something."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.312,3218.848,You what?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3218.848,3223.059,I would -- I will concede here that the probable cause for arrest --
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.059,3223.698,Yes?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3223.698,3227.448,Would also be sufficient for issuance of the warrant.
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.448,3230.113,For them to search the suitcase?
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3230.113,3236.985,It -- the issue -- the key to the issue is getting it before the magistrate.
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.985,3239.91,"Well, yes, but what would you have to show the magistrate?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3251.726,3253.058,"Yes, exactly, and --"
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.058,3269.842,"Well, that's -- that might be quite different from the -- suppose you arrested this man for stealing a piano and he had this suitcase with him and you seized him and his suitcase and took him down to the station house."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3271.575,3275.192,"No, and the suitcase should not be searched in that situation."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.192,3277.274,"So, you do need not only the warrant."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3282.836,3283.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.621,3288.285,"It may be the same, exactly."
1978.77-1497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3288.285,3289.689,"And it was, really, in this case, wasn't it?"
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3289.689,3292.071,That's correct.
1978.77-1497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.071,3315.531,"Well, I take it, if you arrest someone who -- because you have probable cause to believe that he just assassinated someone or murdered someone, you might have -- that same probable cause would justify you in getting a warrant for searching his suitcase in a way that probable cause to believe he had stolen a piano would not."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3318.627,3320.752,"Yes, certainly."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3341.242,3355.406,"Well, what you're saying is that the term “reasonable” in the Fourth Amendment means reasonable under all the circumstances of the particular case with all the new ones that may occur in the variations."
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3355.406,3362.479,"And, hopefully, with these well-defined rules as we can possibly create to give us some predictability of the situation."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.479,3365.698,(Voice Overlap) define them very well up to now.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3365.698,3366.155,Pardon me?
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3366.155,3369.229,No one has been able to define them precisely up to now.
1978.77-1497,1,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,3369.229,3372.726,"It's a very difficult problem, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3372.726,3374.134,"Very well, Mr. Lassiter."
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3376.928,3381.807,"Just a very few remarks, Your Honor."
1978.77-1497,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3476.58,3488.278,"General Purvis, would it be the same case if, instead of getting in a taxicab, they got on a bus or subway?"
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3488.278,3497.629,"I frankly don't know, Your Honor, because I am not aware of an extension of the automobile exception to any such large common carrier."
1978.77-1497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3497.629,3501.009,Don't you think there is a difference between a common carrier and a private car?
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3501.009,3503.121,"Yes, sir, to a certain extent that I do."
1978.77-1497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.121,3515.07,"The common carrier might be a taxi which you have commandeered exclusively or you might share it with 2 other passengers, or it might be a bus in which you share it with 50 or 100."
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3515.07,3525.109,"I think that, of all the common carriers of which I know, that the taxicab probably is intended to be a repository of the fewer number of people."
1978.77-1497,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3704.034,3716.955,"Of course, the practical matter if there had been nothing incriminatory inside that suitcase, the respondents would have consented to the search and you wouldn't have any exigent problem."
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3716.955,3719.203,"Certainly, which leads to another problem."
1978.77-1497,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3719.203,3720.763,And there wouldn't have been any delay.
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3720.763,3725.61,"Which, leads to another problem too, and that is consent."
1978.77-1497,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3775.045,3777.221,Was your Court unanimous in those cases?
1978.77-1497,2,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,3777.221,3777.905,"Yes, sir, they were."
1978.77-1497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3787.104,3787.777,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
