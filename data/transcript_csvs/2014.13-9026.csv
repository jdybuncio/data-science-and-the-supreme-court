2014.13-9026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.302,"We will now hear argument next this morning in Case No. 13-9026, Whitfield v. United States."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,6.587,10.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.349,52.599,Why isn't it justified by the text?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,52.599,55.651,"--Your Honor, it's not justified by the text, first--"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.651,63.256,"I can -- I can accompany my -- my wife to her table when we go to a dinner party, and we're -- we're seated at different tables."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,67.558,76.664,"--Your Honor, our view is not that it is technically improper, but that it is -- it would not be an ordinary and natural usage of the word “ accompany ”, for example, to say--"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.664,79.15,I just gave you an ordinary and natural use.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,81.118,90.057,"--Our view is that it is not an ordinary usage to say were you accompanied, for example, from this side of the lectern to this side, which is the amount of movement the government believes is -- is covered."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,94.276,113.337,"You -- you think there's a spatial component to -- I mean, what -- I don't understand why you say it's -- it's not normal usage, unless you say there is a spatial requirement that you -- to accompany somebody, you have to walk a longer distance, and I -- the example I just gave you suggests otherwise."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,113.337,120.676,"Your Honor, our view of the -- in the ordinary usage it is used in the sense of going to a destination, to the theater, to the ballpark."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.309,122.895,To my wife's table.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,122.895,136.769,"--Well, even if there is some question about whether the usage of just a movement of a few feet is an ordinary usage, where there are multiple, possible meanings of a term, we look to the statutory context and the statutory structure--"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.769,146.976,"I'm asking you whether there are multiple possible -- listen, I'm very big on the rule of lenity, but the condition for it is that there be ambiguity."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,153.98,154.916,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.916,157.216,"And the rule here is, you know, garbage in, garbage out."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,163.436,171.192,"--Well, Justice Scalia, first, whether there's ambiguity is determined not by looking at the word “ accompany ” in isolation."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.795,210.851,20 steps -- 20 steps is horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's enough of an accompaniment?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,211.303,215.805,"Well, Your Honor, we don't believe there's going to be a bright-line rule based on the number of steps or the number of feet."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.805,216.99,I don't insist on a bright-line rule.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,227.945,234.449,We think the best way to effectuate the structure of the scheme is to have a finding of substantiality.
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.292,251.578,That's a -- that's a very different rule than in your brief.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,259.234,264.036,"--Your Honor, we believe that “ substantial ” is -- is implied in the structure."
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,265.938,266.521,Let's say we disagree.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,268.855,277.961,"--If you disagree with that, then I think you would look -- you could just apply a de minimis principle and say that movement of just a few feet within a person's own home is--"
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,277.961,279.23,How much is a few feet?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,279.23,286.484,"--Well, in this case, it's about 4 to 9 feet, which is approximately from where you're sitting, Justice Sotomayor, to where you're sitting, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.417,289.019,I thought the record was different.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,292.238,293.823,--It's not.
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,298.792,299.125,I'm sorry.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,302.311,309.432,--If you look at the -- the government asserts that it was 20 feet from the front door all the way back to the room.
2014.13-9026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,322.657,324.359,Is it contextual?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,329.413,330.196,Yes.
2014.13-9026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,346.706,356.23,But it seems -- the reason I ask is that it -- it strikes me that it makes a difference if it's in part of the robbery itself.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,373.173,377.475,"Well, you're right and we agree with you on the -- that it is a contextual inquiry."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.445,384.495,Except that the statute says
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,393.25,396.286,I -- I believe--
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.286,397.471,"The answer is yes, right?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,397.471,412.464,"--Well, that language in our view would be satisfied by the hypothetical -- or by the -- not a hypothetical -- by an actual case that we see in Wilson, for example, which is cited in the government's brief where the bank robber goes to a bank employee's home, forces them to come with him from their home to the bank to facilitate the robbery."
2014.13-9026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,422.337,427.824,"If the test is -- if the test is that there must be something that's substantial, how would you instruct the jury?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,427.824,433.127,We would instruct the jury first to say it must be more than de minimus or trivial movement.
2014.13-9026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,447.721,452.273,"But your first -- when you just said it's not de minimis, is that your primary argument?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,454.391,457.01,We believe that resolves this case.
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.42,473.704,"The woman died from a heart attack, didn't she?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,474.638,476.204,--No.
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.204,484.577,And -- and part of what frightened her may have been the -- the fact that your client forced her to go from one room to another.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,484.577,495.302,"Well, Justice Scalia, there is no doubt this is a tragic and sad case, but Section 2113(e) provides a mechanism for the government to hold Mr. Whitfield directly responsible--"
2014.13-9026,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.302,496.085,But why wouldn't it be--
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,496.085,496.985,--for the fact that she passed away.
2014.13-9026,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.985,500.606,--Why wouldn't it be substantial when you go from one room to another?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,503.891,506.943,"The reason for that, I think, is if you look at the structure--"
2014.13-9026,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.943,509.378,"I mean, we're -- we're looking for -- for guidelines here."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,514.614,527.856,"--I think the problem with that interpretation, Justice Kennedy, is that it sweeps in so many A offenses because the movement of just a few feet inside the bank, as Justice -- as Mr. Chief Justice referred to, happens frequently."
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.129,544.901,I don't think that a few feet from a cash register to a vault -- I've actually never seen the vault.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,555.523,561.994,"--Well, the -- the typical bank robbery happens in branch offices which are probably half the size of this courtroom, so I don't believe it's going to be--"
2014.13-9026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.994,570.952,"I can see -- I think the statistics that we were shown is that the vast majority of bank robberies are at the counter, that people are not moved at all."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,570.952,588.078,"--Well, we don't know the latter aspect of that in that no -- one including the government under the current iteration of the U.S. Attorneys' Manual before this case -- has been looking at the question of whether a person was moved a single step -- again, from this side of the lectern to that, from this side of the counter to that -- in the course of the bank robbery."
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.014,594.382,This case -- this case didn't involve a single step.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,611.01,614.879,"--Well, the judge will always address that in the first instance under a Rule 29 motion."
2014.13-9026,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.651,629.405,"Now, you -- you say there is -- there is no proper instruction to a jury that would allow this case to go to the jury?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,629.405,630.674,--That is correct.
2014.13-9026,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,631.141,632.357,That isn't de minimis.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,638.594,645.166,"--Well, the -- the government even agrees with us here that this isn't a confinement statute, and that goes back to the--"
2014.13-9026,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.166,645.683,Wait.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,673.418,683.04,"--The problem, Justice Breyer, is that that converts this into a confinement provision, and Congress pointedly did not write a confinement provision."
2014.13-9026,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.261,690.761,It's a very peculiar statute.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,721.582,735.323,"I will agree with you that Congress could have written a much more precise statute here, but we think that it -- given the penalty structure and the increased ten-year mandatory minimum that would apply here in so many bank robbery cases--"
2014.13-9026,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,735.323,746.797,"Well, I'm not so sure what -- if you were going to draft the statute to reach some of this conduct where people are forced to accompany the robber, how would you have done it?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,746.797,755.136,"--I think if Congress wanted to adopt the government's interpretation of this statute, it should have said forces someone to accompany him for any distance whatsoever."
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.576,764.276,In an ordinary use it doesn't.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,781.037,785.405,"Well, again, we don't disagree that it's a permissible usage."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.658,815.86,"Because that was evident from the rest of the statute, right?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,815.86,817.01,--And I think it's--
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.01,824.513,"I mean, all the statutes you cite, they make it clear that -- that you are talking about accompanying over a long distance, kidnapping or whatever else."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,835.554,842.475,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I disagree with you that we don't have the other indications in this statute, and I would start with the noscitur principle under Section (e)."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.538,881.45,"It -- it didn't it didn't make it comparable to murder because the provision itself says that the -- the accompaniment shall be -- a person accompanied shall be in prison not less than 10 years or if death results, shall be punished by death or life in prison."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,882.785,891.141,"Well, the death results language was added in 1994 as a conforming amendment to bring the statute in line with this Court's jurisprudence."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.785,913.82,"Which -- which statute was your client prosecuted under, the old one or the current one?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,913.82,915.506,"Well, certainly under the current one."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.506,916.372,"Yeah, well--"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,916.372,924.712,But the -- the context is still the same in -- in the relationship with the killing offense.
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,969.422,971.357,"I'm sorry, I would like to stop you for a minute."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,991.169,992.135,--Death results.
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,992.135,994.121,"--death results, right."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,994.121,1002.126,"Justice Ginsburg, you are correct that the Fourth Circuit threw out the death results finding because it had not been charged in the initial indictment."
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.063,1025.075,"So this -- this jury -- I mean the issue of causing the death, that wasn't charged and the defendant was not acquitted of that?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1025.075,1027.375,--But that is a separate offense.
2014.13-9026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1056.527,1063.281,"If the test is more than de minimis, what does the judge tell the jury if the jury says we don't understand what de minimis means?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1063.281,1069.521,"I think de minimis is often, in other jury instructions, defined as trivial or insignificant, and we would--"
2014.13-9026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.521,1070.871,What does that mean?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1076.439,1082.761,"--Well, in our view, this is the easy case in that it's only a few feet and it's entirely within a person's own home."
2014.13-9026,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.117,1094.819,"--You want to know what, I mean, that's exactly the same question."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1133.111,1138.765,"Justice Breyer, I would go back to the jury instruction that I set out earlier."
2014.13-9026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1154.775,1162.129,"The problem is we don't -- the jury would not know and the court would not know what you are looking at, what ultimately you're concerned about."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1195.952,1208.259,--I think in part you are over reading what Congress was trying to do here by suggesting that if the person was put in particular fear or danger or trauma that that would justify any charge.
2014.13-9026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1211.144,1212.563,What is the reason for this?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1226.471,1239.212,"--We know that Congress viewed the forced accompaniment provision as similar to kidnapping, which under the Federal law at the time required transportation entirely out of State and under common law required transportation out of the country."
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.366,1249.834,--How do I know Congress considered it equivalent to kidnapping?
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1250.602,1254.554,"Well, for those of you who do consider the legislative history, there are--"
2014.13-9026,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.554,1255.804,"No, I don't know it at all."
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1255.804,1266.946,"--So you may not know this but -- I think, Justice Scalia, you do know it from the context, and particularly from the association that Congress made in Section (e) between forced accompaniment and killing."
2014.13-9026,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.077,1291.829,To do that you had to cross State lines.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1297.148,1298.783,"--No, absolutely not, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-9026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1347.75,1354.504,"You might be right that it's the heart of what Congress was trying to get at, but this happens all the time when Congress writes statutes, right?"
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1370.513,1377.767,"Well, I think when you put the words they use in the context in which they use them, it limits it to that kind of scenario."
2014.13-9026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1443.389,1446.741,But here it wasn't a single step.
2014.13-9026,0,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,1461.335,1474.594,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I disagree that -- and the government actually agrees with us at page 40 of their brief -- with the notion that dangerousness by itself can convert something into an accompaniment that is not."
2014.13-9026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.024,1548.826,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1554.045,1556.98,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.643,1610.716,"Yes, but all the definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with somebody as an associate or companion."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1630.928,1633.83,"I think you are right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.236,1670.255,"All right, you take two bank robberies."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1692.785,1701.474,"Well, I think it does make sense because I think Congress understood, and I think in practice we would see that the first bank robber in your first hypothetical is not going to get probation."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1705.261,1717.503,"But they didn't care exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year because of extenuating circumstances, whatever."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1724.489,1737.732,"--And I think that they had good reason to do that, but I also just want to highlight that the 10-year mandatory minimum that they set for the forced accompaniment offense is right in the middle of the range for a completely unaggravated, unarmed bank robbery in violation of Section 2113."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1737.732,1738.632,Range where?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1738.632,1741.784,Of the statutory range of zero -- probation to 20 years.
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1786.813,1787.58,Do you think there's--
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.58,1788.93,The problem -- the problem--
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1902.02,1903.67,"Yes, absolutely."
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1949.25,1958.54,"--But that's what you are going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be prosecutorial good judgment that's going to separate the case that's, like, could you come with me a couple of feet."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1958.54,1968.129,"Well, I think that is part of it and I do think it's important to highlight that the -- the charging guidance that my friend points to does permit the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to determine individual cases."
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1968.129,1968.479,Right.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1974.466,1979.12,"Well, I guess I don't understand my friend to be really asking for a de minimis exception, but let me--"
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1979.12,1980.77,I'm asking about a de minimis exception.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1980.77,1989.809,"--Well, the reason why I don't think de minimis, although we could talk about very short movements and my friend likes to and -- we can talk about, I don't think that de minimis movements should be excluded."
2014.13-9026,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1991.492,1992.309,Even the one step?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1992.309,1994.194,"--Yes, Your Honor, even the one step."
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.037,2018.91,"You know, I thought that was the case, which is why I didn't understand Justice Breyer's question where he said the amiable bank robber says, would you please step--"
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.776,2022.695,"--Yeah, I'm going to walk into a bank robbery where they have about--"
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.695,2024.428,Step over there or I'll blow your head off is what he says.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2024.428,2026.461,"--Yes, and I imagine a request--"
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.461,2033.032,"My -- my example was meant to encompass a polite, but armed, bank robber."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2034.717,2060.698,"But the point is the idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and all you have to do, again I -- guess it's repeating the question is -- you got two feet and the prosecutor is armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket, and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to go to trial."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2060.698,2064.236,"--Well, we know that Congress drafted the statute as a mandatory minimum provision."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.938,2070.89,"Well, that begs the question, I think."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2070.89,2088.101,"--But, well, I was going to try to get to the answer, which is that the reason why Congress did that and I think the discussion today highlights is because, number one, it's very, very hard to separate out the cases that drive at the heartland of what Congress was concerned about, the human shield and the hostages situations, with any sort of rule based on distance."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2088.101,2091.303,"Well, your U.S. attorney's manual does just that."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2103.461,2106.313,"I -- I'm not sure that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2120.054,2124.874,"So -- so you think when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the two -- foot situation."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2124.874,2125.89,"Potentially, yes."
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.594,2131.144,"Well, of that -- why don't we say that?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2157.012,2159.131,"--Well, Congress used very, very different language."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2184.329,2191.585,"So the manual is read -- forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to move two feet."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2192.785,2193.335,Yes.
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2200.108,2215.55,"And so the manual which -- the other provision in the manual which is that you should charge as large an offense as possible means that in the case where somebody is forced to move two feet, you charge the -- that as a forcible abduction."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2215.55,2220.871,"No, that is not correct and in part that is because the manual doesn't say you always charge the most serious offense."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.31,2231.91,So is two feet consistent with the conduct at issue?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2231.91,2255.775,"Well, I think -- I think there is a reason and I -- I do think there's a reason why Congress covered even very short movements, and that's in part because every time a robber forces someone to go with him he exposes that person to a great degree of trauma, to physical danger, and I think also Congress reasonably decided not to try to write in a limitation to use a term that includes movements as short as a few feet because it's so difficult to draw a line."
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2282.51,2287.58,"When Congress first drafted this accompanying language, this was a capital offense, yes?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2287.58,2288.748,"Potentially, yes."
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2288.748,2293.217,"So, I mean, would you say the same thing if it were still a capital offense?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2293.217,2294.2,We would.
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.739,2326.656,"--Of course that was unconstitutional, right?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2329.909,2331.042,--That's correct.
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.659,2335.727,"For even even kidnapping, you know, taking the person away when you're fleeing."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2342.633,2343.6,--That's correct.
2014.13-9026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2344.5,2360.176,"I guess I was just suggesting that maybe we should take that into account in thinking about what Congress could have meant for this statute to mean, but it seems -- it -- it seems very unlikely that Congress meant to give the death penalty to somebody who forced another person to move two feet."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2360.176,2366.764,"--And I think Congress probably understood that a jury would be very unlikely, in fact, almost certain not to recommend the death penalty in a case like that."
2014.13-9026,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2366.764,2367.114,"Well, no, no."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2373.767,2383.558,"But, Justice Kennedy, I'm not suggesting that they nullify on the guilt offense, but the penalty provision in the 1934 statute said it's punishable by death if the verdict of the jury shall so 19 recommend--"
2014.13-9026,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2383.558,2383.975,Are the--
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2383.975,2386.493,--which permitted a jury to decide the severity of the offense.
2014.13-9026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2386.493,2388.11,What's wrong with de minimis?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2409.608,2410.308,"Well, I -- I--"
2014.13-9026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2410.308,2422.266,And they can then use their judgment instead of the prosecutor about when something is causing the kind of fear that Congress worried about.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2422.266,2426.568,"--Well, I think that's a long ways from the statutory text, first and foremost."
2014.13-9026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2428.77,2441.828,"Well, we we've basically said, albeit only a civil area, that we always assume that trivial and inconsequential matters will not be covered by law."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2441.828,2442.88,--You're right.
2014.13-9026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2443.514,2446.049,I don't know why that can't be true in the criminal area either.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2446.049,2448.668,--De minimis is a general principle of law.
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.756,2467.712,"Well, if we were going to apply it I guess what we would apply is was there significant fear or trauma induced?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2485.172,2497.397,I do think that that's right and I think that points up that crafting any sort of a de minimis or substantiality requirement that tried to get at the concerns that Congress had in passing the statute would be extremely hard to do.
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.77,2511.639,"Well, but you could say de minimis did because of the language that you point to, accompaniment."
2014.13-9026,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.532,2551.999,It's a very bad statute.
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.999,2554.918,Would you admit that?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2554.918,2556.134,--I would disagree with that.
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.36,2570.943,"Yes, that's true."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2570.943,2574.564,"Respectfully, though, I don't think he's been able to substantiate that with any kind of evidence."
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2575.831,2582.068,"Well, 95 or over 90 percent of all the criminal charges in the country are pleaded guilty."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2584.353,2584.803,--I--
2014.13-9026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.803,2594.543,And certainly you do read lots of criticisms of people pleading guilty because they are afraid that in the absence of the guilty plea the sentence will go way up.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2600.047,2607.636,--I understand the concern but it arises only to the extent that forced accompaniments of short distances are common in bank robberies.
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.636,2607.869,"No, no."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2631.418,2634.536,"I don't think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2652.996,2656.13,How would you -- how would you see the evidence of prosecutorial abuse?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2666.155,2670.54,"--Well, for one thing, I mean, both sides here are looking at the fact patterns in reported cases."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2671.09,2674.625,It would not be a reported case because he would have pled guilty.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2674.625,2681.296,"--But even guilty pleas can give rise to reported cases that describe the facts of the offense if there's an appeal relating to sentencing, as there often is."
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2689.834,2695.554,When they plead guilty don't they have to -- I don't remember if this is just limited to the State systems or not -- don't they have to waive their rights to appeal?
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2695.554,2699.023,--In some cases guilty pleas do include waivers of appeal rights.
2014.13-9026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2753.674,2756.543,But the problem is that there is some fortuity in this.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2772.821,2775.487,There's -- there's no doubt that there's some fortuity.
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2815.414,2818.45,"Well, I just don't see that as a common sense proposition."
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2828.822,2833.793,"So I think potentially in -- in the case with a gun, but a couple of points on that."
2014.13-9026,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2973.996,3002.164,"--Suppose we had substantial evidence that prosecutors were using the threat of this extra charge in order to obtain guilty pleas, very substantial evidence, would that be a basis for us to rule that the statute is either inoperable altogether or that it should be interpreted in a way consistent with what the Petitioner argues?"
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3002.164,3004.266,--I don't think so.
2014.13-9026,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.869,3017.19,So you think that concern is simply irrelevant to the interpretative task that we face.
2014.13-9026,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3017.19,3024.863,I think the Court has said that the interpretative task in interpreting a statute is to give the words of the statute their ordinary meaning in the context in which they're enacted.
2014.13-9026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.833,3060.116,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-9026,2,56122,joshua_b_carpenter,,3062.302,3064.987,Thank you.
2014.13-9026,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3249.955,3250.971,"Thank you, Counsel."
