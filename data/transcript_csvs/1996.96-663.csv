1996.96-663,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.908,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-663, Marvin Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corporation."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,10.008,15.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.051,111.484,"Well, you're assuming... when you say that all of the elements don't have to be present at the beginning, you're assuming that if I am injured by the first of three predicate acts I have suffered a RICO injury, aren't you?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,130.205,133.039,"--Well... no, this Court has not held that."
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.664,164.148,But if the injury precedes the pattern it's rather hard to say that it was a RICO injury.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,164.148,165.49,"Well, the--"
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.49,168.852,And I'm not sure that that's necessary in your case.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,168.852,170.542,"--No, it's not necessary in our case, but let me--"
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.542,175.627,"It is necessary to the theory of statute of limitations you're pressing upon us, however."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,190.167,207.177,"--If I may explain, the way I view the structure of the statute and the definition itself, it assumes already in place, and the only way by definition that we can conclude that a pattern exists is that we have a beginning and that we have an end."
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,245.433,253.817,"That still leaves the metaphysical question, or maybe the legal question of why there can be a RICO injury before there's a RICO in existence."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,253.817,286.299,"--The... it is a metaphysical question, I grant you, but the way the Congress has defined pattern of racketeering activity and the way this Court has interpreted it, it can only be decided whether or not it existed in the past, and what the framework of your question is, that somehow we need to be able to identify it in prospect, and it can't be done, and that's the point."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.299,290.082,"Well, I don't see it that way myself."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,314.526,326.724,"Well, I would not concede that, because in Havens Realty this Court has indicated that where we have a continuing tort the proper rule of accrual can be from the last predicate act."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.724,349.811,"Well, it could be, but the normal rule as I understand it is that the statute of limitations will begin to run as of the time the cause of action comes into existence, and under RICO, it doesn't come into existence until all the elements are present, injury, predicate acts, and pattern."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,349.811,351.551,In--
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.551,358.327,"And as of that moment, then, it could start to run, the statute of limitations, isn't that right?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,358.327,362.03,"--Well, I have two answers to that."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.301,380.181,I think some courts have applied such a rule.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,389.789,397.723,"--Well, that may be, and... I guess I've forgotten what the original question was, if you could restate it, please."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.723,408.51,"Well, as applied to your case I don't see why the statute wouldn't begin to run once you can say all the elements of the RICO cause of action are in existence."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,408.51,426.432,"All right, and if I may get to that, I think what this Court has said, for example, in Havens Realty is, if we have a continuing violation the concerns that we typically have for a statute of limitations such as repose and staleness, they fade away."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.933,461.935,"Well, this statute is patterned after the antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and that also can involve a continuing stream of conduct by the violator, and what rule have we applied there for statute of limitations?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,461.935,466.269,"I understand that, but I think applying... adopting the statute of limitations--"
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.269,468.891,"What rule have we applied there, do you think?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,468.891,473.114,"--As I understand it, the antitrust rule is... runs from the date of injury."
1996.96-663,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.114,480.188,"Yes, so... and if this action, RICO is patterned after that, why shouldn't it be the same?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,480.188,498.72,"Because the rule of accrual is different than the statute of limitations, and I think that the rule of accrual that the Court selects must take account of the elements, and one of the unique elements of RICO is pattern, and that's not... that doesn't exist in the antitrust laws."
1996.96-663,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.72,527.959,"Mr. Bird, as I understand it the principal difference between your case and others is the principal problem that you have is the identification of the source, and in Clayton Act cases generally it's known who it is, but here, it isn't a question of injury or pattern, it's a question of, you didn't know the source, and that's why I found your argument rather puzzling."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,557.709,560.29,"Yes, we would."
1996.96-663,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.881,589.761,"And that's the whole thing of your case is they knew they were hurt, and then they knew that there had been all this advertising, but they didn't connect the pattern with the source of the injuries."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,589.761,590.55,That's correct.
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.607,616.129,"Well, of course, that assumes the question."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,625.612,645.848,"And that is true, but if... if... let's assume that the RICO plaintiff is able to establish that and meets the pattern element, which is a strict element that this Court has imposed under the H.J. case, two acts are not necessarily enough."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.265,677.208,"I wouldn't have that problem if I wouldn't allow the first suit, right?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,683.542,684.392,--And--
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.392,685.984,"I'll give you 10 years, not 30."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,685.984,688.415,"--Well, of course, the definition--"
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.415,699.862,"That is the distance between the first predicate act and the second, so the person who is injured 10 years later after the first one clearly has a RICO cause of action, and the first predicate act occurred 10 years ago."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,702.042,734.825,"--What I... of course, I tried to address that, and what I'm saying is that once we are able to identify the pattern, that is... and understand what I'm saying here is that being able to identify a pattern is only a matter of perception, and that means that we have a judge or an attorney or a RICO plaintiff saying, I'm looking back in time, and what is... what can I perceive from what's gone on in the past, and that implies, of course, discovery."
1996.96-663,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.746,743.379,It seems to me your clients were incredibly obtuse not to have discovered this.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,743.379,747.182,"--Well, I disagree with that."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.939,783.197,"Mr. Bird, I agree that all of the elements have to have been in existence, as Justice O'Connor suggested, but why do you think all of the elements have to be known, including the existence of the pattern?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,821.042,822.043,No.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.524,823.432,--the same 2-year statute for both?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,823.432,823.913,--No.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.913,825.344,It's his problem.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,844.345,855.575,"I agree with your hypothetical that that wouldn't extend the statute of limitations, but here it's within his power to make that investigation and to find out."
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.272,897.661,"No, but even on the traditional rule, isn't it your position also that because one of the elements is fraud, and because fraud at least will normally be accorded a discovery rule, that therefore you have until the point of reasonable discovery, even under the traditional rule, or a traditional analysis, without regard to the peculiarity of RICO itself."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,899.003,907.548,"Well, I think part of our position... that is part of our position, but understand, the rule we're advocating, which is the criminal last predicate act--"
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.548,942.131,"Oh, I quite realize that, but if you take the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave you, and you substitute for the intentional versus negligent act a fraudulent act, I take it your position would be that even though so far as the element of failure to supply what they offered or any conventional tort, as to that the statute might run immediately."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,952.198,954.458,"--That is true, as... and that--"
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.458,973.092,"So that you may very well lose the case conceptually by the adoption of a Clayton kind of analysis here, and yet if there were a traditional... if traditional treatment were given to the discovery aspect of the fraudulent element, you might still be in court."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,973.092,974.772,--Well--
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.772,976.704,You might still go back and have something to litigate.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,976.704,978.165,--Yes.
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.973,1024.844,"Yes, but he wouldn't... that wouldn't help if the injury was within the statutory period."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1024.844,1026.617,That's true.
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.205,1049.131,"What is it... is it your view, then, the statute would run forever, there's no statute, or is it 13 years, or what is it?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1078.6,1087.876,Let's assume... your hypothetical necessarily assumes that since 1940 the RICO enterprise has been engaged in--
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.876,1089.406,"Yes, one act every 5 years."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1096.222,1097.003,"--Right, and--"
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.003,1101.835,"And it's the same person, and he's done it year after year, so what do we do under your theory?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1105.899,1106.35,--Yes.
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.35,1107.298,"--whether it's... there's none, right?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1107.298,1107.799,Yes.
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.961,1113.362,All right.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1121.666,1125.02,"--Well, there is a statute of limitations, and it's 4 years."
1996.96-663,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1125.02,1140.74,"No, but I mean... and if I have a price-fixing case I take it that if they've been engaged in fixing the prices of their electrical conduits for 30 years and I've been hurt, I can go back only... is it 3, or is it... 3, I think."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1154.078,1169.94,"Right, and the answer to that question is that the congressional intent, as stated in the preamble and also is recognized by this Court, is in part under Turkette to divest the enterprise of all its ill-gotten gains."
1996.96-663,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.94,1170.851,All right.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1194.826,1204.571,"Yes, and I think it's the congressional policies and objectives that are contained in the structure of the statute itself, as well as the policies underlying the law."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.079,1249.13,That argument was raised in Malley-Duff.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1264.06,1265.152,--I understand that.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.152,1266.652,We have adopted a 4-year statute.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1266.652,1267.293,You have.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.293,1268.883,Surely it has to have some meaning.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1268.883,1269.985,"Yes, it does."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.985,1279.441,"And it has no meaning if in Justice Breyer's hypo the thing can be rejuvenated every 5 years, every time there's a new predicate act."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1293.45,1312.333,"What... the policy advanced there is that if you adopt a rule of accrual, once the defendant makes up his own mind that I'm going to stop this criminal activity he knows that 4 years later his liability's over."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.313,1316.434,"Unless he changes his mind 5 years later, right?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1316.434,1327.733,"--Then if he's foolish enough to do what you just said, which I think is a little bit unlikely, but let's assume that it takes place, why shouldn't we get him for it?"
1996.96-663,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.904,1341.702,"What other statute of limitations works that way, where the statute has run and then someone does something again and somehow it's all... the statute has ceased running."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1357.47,1361.944,"Well, I differ with that."
1996.96-663,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.317,1367.167,"Well, Havens was an unusual case."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1372.23,1375.334,"--Well, okay."
1996.96-663,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.334,1384.588,"Mr. Bird, I continue to be troubled by the abstract quality of your discussion, because here it wasn't every 5 years."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1404.062,1416.509,"Under the last predicate act rule we would still be timely, and I think that that's... there are a myriad of reasons why a person who suffers some type of injury might not sue at the beginning."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.509,1418.512,What was the last predicate act?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1427.978,1428.376,No.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.796,1431.3,"--and tells the seller, that's a perfectly good silo?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1432.3,1434.27,"--That's a new predicate act, but--"
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.27,1435.522,Why is it a new predicate act?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1442.618,1449.111,"--Well, I think he is getting more money from the overall marketing scheme and strategy."
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.667,1459.679,Sales to other people.
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1459.679,1463.511,--And repairs to the Klehrs themselves.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.827,1476.818,They charged for these repairs?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1476.818,1477.389,Certainly.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.651,1479.11,"They made a profit on it, do you think?"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1479.11,1479.531,--Pardon me?
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.531,1481.093,They made a profit on these repairs?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1482.172,1489.548,I don't think... I don't think there's anything in the record that says they made a profit.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.548,1508.939,"Well, I'm concerned with... your brief makes this point both for extending the RICO statute and also for asserting that even if we don't adopt your position as to the last predicate act there was in fact a new and separate injury when these later... when these later--"
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1508.939,1509.33,Yes.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.33,1512.191,"--representations were made, a new accrual, in other words."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1512.191,1512.592,Okay.
1996.96-663,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.092,1515.414,"Yes, I'd like you to do that."
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1515.904,1533.636,"Of course, the circuits are really in a big state of confusion regarding this rule of accrual, and does it require separate and independent injury, or does it require a new predicate act, does it require both, and if so what is a separate and independent injury and what is a new predicate act?"
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.621,1650.082,--They don't have to obtain anything further?
1996.96-663,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,1650.082,1650.542,--Pardon?
1996.96-663,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1650.542,1652.743,They don't have to obtain anything further?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1792.658,1804.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-663,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.654,1840.798,"But Mr. Ennis, you have to have a cause of action in existence, don't you, under RICO?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1840.798,1842.34,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-663,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1842.34,1844.751,"There has to be a pattern, and the predicate acts, and the injury."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1844.751,1847.023,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-663,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.023,1851.245,So we're not talking about anything that starts before those things are present.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1851.245,1852.124,Not at all.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1863.824,1865.154,Does that include injury?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1865.154,1869.238,And the plaintiff has discovered injury.
1996.96-663,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.359,1873.879,"All right, now what if it involves fraud."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1881.286,1881.716,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-663,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.935,1918.549,What do we do about the situation of additional mailing later on?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1922.971,1926.063,"Justice O'Connor, there are two aspects to your question, if I understand it correctly."
1996.96-663,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.733,2001.744,Mr.--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2001.744,2003.173,--so the separate accrual rule does not help these petitioners.
1996.96-663,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2003.173,2021.856,"--Mr. Ennis, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the rule was the discovery rule was injury plus source, not merely injury, and here, as I said to Mr. Bird, it seems to me the whole problem was not injury, was not pattern, but source."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2026.839,2043.942,"Justice Ginsburg, to be as candid as I can, I think there's confusion in the lower courts on whether the discovery-of-injury rule means discovery of the injury or, as a few courts have said, discovery of the injury and the source of the injury, meaning who caused it."
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.771,2066.255,You don't need 4 years if you know both the injury and the source.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2071.588,2072.69,Justice Scalia--
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.69,2075.802,Otherwise we could have a 1-month statute of limitations.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2075.802,2088.041,"--I think that's completely correct, and is the reason why the other competing rule, the discovery-of-injury and discovery-of-pattern rule is not as appropriate for civil RICO as the rule we propose."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2101.177,2109.963,"When you speak of the pattern of racketeering activity, are you speaking of a pattern of racketeering activity which includes, to your knowledge, fraud?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2115.487,2118.369,"It could be, Justice Souter."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2120.991,2121.512,Right.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2121.512,2123.254,"They could involve arson, or embezzlement."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.254,2123.725,"Well, when it does."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2124.276,2124.774,When it does.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.774,2127.986,"The discovery of a pattern is simply, as you're using the term, means discovery of the--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2127.986,2133.532,"It means discovery of the acts, which in law would constitute a fraud."
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.916,2178.63,"--Mr.... I'm not... I've never understood this fully, but I'm not certain that we have to go into... I'm not certain we have to go into the question of fraudulent... when you discover it and... what is it called, fraudulent concealment, but if we do, what is it you have to know?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2197.843,2201.045,"Your Honor, I believe it would start to run."
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2201.045,2203.106,"Well, how does it work, for example, in price-fixing?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2232.866,2238.689,"Justice Breyer, that is the Clayton Act rule, the basic Clayton Act rule."
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.495,2252.538,"Yes, but there's a thing called fraudulent concealment which operates in order to prevent the very problem that I'm focusing on."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2252.538,2253.75,That's a different doctrine.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.044,2306.655,"So in other words, if I'm thinking conceptually, is this right, in cases like price-fixing or fraud, it starts to run from the moment that you discovery your injury, i.e., you wrote a bigger check."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2310.527,2310.895,--That's correct.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.895,2312.567,Which isn't hard to know.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2321.293,2328.188,"If there is actual fraudulent concealment, which has two components, first that the defendant's acts actually concealed--"
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.188,2328.639,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2328.639,2329.45,--the elements of the claim.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.45,2330.312,All right.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2330.312,2331.153,That was not this case.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.153,2331.603,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2331.603,2333.974,"Second, that's not this case for a second reason."
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.129,2362.201,Why do you say there's no actual concealment here?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2389.33,2390.1,"Absolutely, Justice--"
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.1,2395.824,So why isn't that concealment of the element of knowledge that it wasn't a properly working silo?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2395.824,2406.5,"--First of all, as Justice Kennedy's question earlier suggested, that question assumes that it is fraud, and that my client, A. O. Smith, knows that the silos won't work."
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.5,2407.081,"Well, of course it does."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2412.295,2424.803,"Well, in this case the reason it doesn't conceal, even if you assume it's a fraud, is that the claims here are based on allegations that my client misrepresented the benefits of this silo."
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.669,2455.935,"You're retreating to the second item that you raised in your response to Justice Breyer, namely that even where there is concealment--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2455.935,2457.294,No.
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.294,2460.046,--it does not excuse you if the--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2460.046,2461.529,No.
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.529,2465.402,--or it doesn't work to the plaintiff's advantage if a diligent plaintiff would have discovered it.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2465.402,2465.689,No.
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.689,2468.261,You're saying a diligent plaintiff would have discovered it.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2468.261,2468.561,No.
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.105,2471.653,"Well, I didn't understand you."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2471.653,2473.986,--I'm trying to address the first part of your question.
1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.986,2474.515,Whether there's concealment.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2474.515,2487.324,"There's no concealment at all, because there is nothing the defendant did or could do that could conceal from the petitioners that the representations on which they relied were not materializing."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2487.324,2490.427,But that only goes to the contract description.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2508.439,2524.46,"Justice Souter, they claim... if you look at B-2 of the appendix to the cert petition, they claim that the... the representations which they alleged were fraudulent included representations that this silo would make it possible for them to eliminate protein supplements."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2533.524,2534.285,"Right, and when did they--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2534.285,2534.666,That never happened.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2534.666,2545.762,"--When did they not merely know that those representations were proving to be untrue, but when did they also know that Smith knew they were untrue when they made them?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2545.762,2555.488,"Well, Justice Souter, no one ever knows for sure whether a defendant in a fraud case knows that claims are true or untrue until you've brought the trial and win or lose."
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2555.488,2557.41,"Well, it's a question of circumstantial evidence--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2557.41,2557.85,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2557.85,2558.421,--like a great deal else.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2558.421,2558.932,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2558.932,2573.501,"And I think the only point that I'm making is, on the fraudulent concealment rule, it does not answer the fraudulent concealment rule issue to say they should have known that the silo was not living up to its description."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2582.928,2583.737,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2583.737,2585.109,--description or representation.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2585.109,2601.418,"Well, both lower courts, answering that second question, which was the second question in Justice Scalia's question, by concluding that doing the evidence most favorably for the petitioners they knew or should have known all of the elements of their RICO claim, including that this was fraud--"
1996.96-663,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.418,2602.078,Mr. Ennis--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2602.078,2604.37,"--if it was fraud, more than 6 years before--"
1996.96-663,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2604.37,2612.357,"--Explain that to me, because as a matter of fact, and I don't think this is disputed, these farmers consulted a veterinarian."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2641.305,2671.827,"--Your Honor, this case involves a lot of facts not all of which are in the cert petition or the appendix, but after reviewing all those facts, including the facts that the petitioners could simply have taken feed from the silo to be tested, which is a normal regular thing that most farmers do at least twice a year, which would have showed them that the feed from the silo either was good quality or bad quality... they didn't do that."
1996.96-663,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.657,2689.157,Mr.--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2716.763,2717.144,No.
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2721.237,2726.36,"Because if you should have discovered the fraud earlier, the fact that there are new acts of fraud are... is irrelevant?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2726.36,2731.313,Unless those new acts cause separate injuries within the limitations period.
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2732.004,2739.46,"Well, suppose this continued to lull them into thinking there's nothing wrong with the silo and he lost 10 more cows?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2739.46,2762.845,"Well, Your Honor, this case, both courts found... and those findings I don't think are properly before the Court, because although petitioner in their brief raises a question about whether the lower courts properly applied the summary judgment standard they did not raise that question in the petition for rehearing in the Eighth Circuit, in their cert petition, the questions presented--"
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2762.845,2783.389,"But just... just with reference to my question, let's assume they came out within 4 years, said oh, this is great feed, knowing that it wasn't, and that 10 more cows were sick or died, and that the plaintiff was lulled into believing that the silo was okay."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2783.389,2792.836,"--That would simply be a continuation of the damages that flowed from the initial fraudulent act if it was fraudulent, inducing him to buy the silo."
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2792.836,2796.168,Why isn't that a repeated injury?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2796.168,2798.56,"Well, it's not a new injury."
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2805.111,2820.692,"So in Justice Breyer's case, where a bank is defrauding people on credit cards, if you should have found out 15 years ago but they keep doing it you can't sue for the last 4 years, or for the period within the statute of limitations since the new acts have occurred?"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2820.692,2821.644,That's correct.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.425,2828.519,"But I thought you said you could recover for the 10 more cows, assuming that it's a new misrepresentation."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2828.519,2831.971,--If it's a new misrepresentation--
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.971,2832.209,"Yes, so--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2832.209,2833.561,--within 4 years--
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2833.561,2833.952,--Right.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2834.483,2835.261,--which causes injury--
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.261,2835.672,Yes.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2835.672,2836.793,--within 4 years you could.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.793,2838.113,"So with the bank, you can... with the bank--"
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2838.113,2838.463,That's right.
1996.96-663,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.463,2841.776,"--if the bank keeps doing it, you recover you just go back 4 years at a time."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2841.776,2842.888,That's not this case.
1996.96-663,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.888,2847.51,"But fraudulent concealment, you don't necessarily need a new injury."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2850.372,2856.415,"Fraudulent concealment can toll, if there are affirmative acts that actually conceal, if there are acts that actually conceal."
1996.96-663,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.415,2869.885,"And the second question presented is whether respondent's fraudulent self-concealing conduct, acts of fraudulent concealment, suspend the statute of limitations, so at least that portion of the fraud claim is presented in the petition for certiorari."
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2869.885,2873.178,We don't dispute that the fraudulent concealment issue is presented.
1996.96-663,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.252,2883.353,May I ask you... may I ask you question kind of going back to the beginning for a minute?
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2903.335,2907.248,"--Again, Justice Stevens, I think that's a substantive question of RICO--"
1996.96-663,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.248,2907.769,Right.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2908.59,2910.181,--It's different from the accrual rule.
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.238,2924.989,Even though there had--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2924.989,2925.73,But that's my personal belief.
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.73,2928.563,--Even though there had been no violation of RICO at the time--
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2928.563,2929.113,At that point.
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2929.113,2929.902,--of his injury.
1996.96-663,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2932.115,2941.74,"That's right, and I reach that conclusion because this is a remedial statute, and Congress understood that some of the patterns could take as much as 10 years."
1996.96-663,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2941.74,2945.393,"Is there any parallel doctrine for that, or is that unique to RICO?"

1996.96-663,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.374,2971.85,"It's so odd that I'm inclined, if you really believe that, to think that the 4-year statute of limitations should be interpreted with similar oddity."
