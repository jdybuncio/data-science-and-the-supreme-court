1984.83-1307,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.815,We will hear arguments first this morning in the United States v. Powell.
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,10.799,30.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, since the time of this Court's decision in Dunn v. United States, more than 50 years ago, the rule has been settled in the federal system that inconsistency in a jury's verdict is not a ground to set aside an otherwise valid conviction."
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.138,197.371,"Mr. Levy, can I ask you a question?"
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,199.812,202.433,It did not cite the Dunn case in its original decision.
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.132,219.405,"I see; because in the first opinion, they merely said there was no evidence to support these convictions."
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,219.405,232.914,"That's correct, and that was said in response to the Government's argument that the verdicts were not, in fact, inconsistent because the jury could have found the Respondent used the telephone to facilitate some offense other than the conspiracy of which she was acquitted."
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.783,252.206,"Well, did they find no evidence in the record to support the theory, or no evidence in the record to support the conviction?"
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,252.206,253.007,No.
1984.83-1307,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,421.066,424.379,"That was Justice Holmes's last epitome, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,424.379,426.841,"That's correct, as this Court noted in Harris v. Rivera."
1984.83-1307,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,426.841,428.19,You said over a lengthy dissent.
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,430.543,431.451,"No, not at all."
1984.83-1307,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.586,712.968,"How did those Circuits try to distinguish Dunn, Mr. Levy?"
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,712.968,717.741,--Those Circuits relied on a passage in Dunn that discussed res judicata.
1984.83-1307,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.943,778.992,But the Court has never held that res judicata can be used in a criminal case to attack verdicts on counts rendered at the same time and submitted to the jury at the same time.
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,778.992,780.161,Absolutely not.
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.552,863.686,"May I ask, though, directing your attention to this paragraph, I suppose one can argue that there were alternative grounds, alternative holdings in Dunn, and that if Justice Holmes really intended to rely on the res judicata analysis, which Justice Butler disagreed with violently, that the statement about inconsistent verdicts is really what is dicta."
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,863.686,869.219,"Well, I suppose that is always the case when there are alternative grounds for decision."
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.197,890.243,"Well, it would stand up, wouldn't it, if he was right, that one of those would not be... would not bar the other and the facts of that particular case?"
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,890.243,893.656,"Well, it's correct that successive prosecutions would have been permissible--"
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.656,894.127,Right.
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,894.127,898.04,--then the inconsistency of verdicts seems an easier case.
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.04,901.831,He wouldn't have needed to make the inconsistent verdict point at all.
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,901.831,911.588,"He wouldn't have needed to, although, again, it could have been an entirely independent and indeed equally mor more important part of the decision."
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.465,938.095,"Yes, assuming they are inconsistent."
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,938.095,938.485,Right.
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.368,964.752,How often has this Court actually rested a decision on the second point of the Dunn case?
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,964.752,966.983,--The second point being the res judicata discussion?
1984.83-1307,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.983,970.376,"No, the inconsistent verdict point, which was the last point of the opinion."
1984.83-1307,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,970.376,987.249,"Well, we think every time that the Court has considered the inconsistent verdict issue since Dunn, it has relied on the basic point that inconsistency in the verdicts is not required, and it has never cited or relied on the res judicata discussion."
1984.83-1307,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1072.512,1075.046,Mr. Cleary.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1075.046,1084.101,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, human absolutes tend toward arbitrariness."
1984.83-1307,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1182.536,1185.358,"Did you argue the case in the Court of Appeals, Mr. Cleary?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1185.358,1186.177,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.177,1186.978,You did not?
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1186.978,1187.859,"No, I did not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.581,1201.278,You would have no way of knowing the rather unusual treatment of the Dunn case in the first opinion of the Court of Appeals.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1201.278,1204.369,"I think that the court was wrestling with the dual issue, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.814,1292.057,"Was the jury properly instructed, in your mind?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1292.057,1293.888,"--No, it was not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.018,1398.096,I don't suppose... do you think the Government would be here if it was clear that the finding was that there was not sufficient evidence to convict of anything?
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1398.096,1401.949,"I can't predict what the Government would do, and I would not want to--"
1984.83-1307,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.949,1420.092,"Well, that isn't... I'll put it to you: What if it were clear that that isn't what they held; that they held that just because, because there wasn't a conviction on one count, there was not sufficient evidence for the other?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1420.092,1422.774,--I would hope that the Government would not come to this Court.
1984.83-1307,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.774,1428.507,But you aren't complaining about Dunn; is that it?
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1428.507,1429.526,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.293,1462.58,And when you say that you could never convict on the telephone counts if there is an acquittal on the conspiracy count.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1462.58,1463.98,"On the charged conspiracy; that is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.98,1464.941,No matter what.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1479.28,1482.973,"No, juries are inconsistent, this Court well knows."
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.519,1616.111,"Ex Parte Bain is virtually dead, isn't it?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1616.111,1617.223,--I wouldn't say so.
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.525,1627.449,Always to distinguish it; never to follow it.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1627.449,1630.79,"--Well, the reason was in that case, there was a very narrow striking from the indictment;"
1984.83-1307,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1675.539,1695.901,"Counsel, if the jury, after listening to the judge's instruction, is of the opinion that these are two different crimes, one involving cocaine, and one cocaine and qualudes, they are different crimes."
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1704.119,1712.094,"--I believe there was a case where there's two options, where the jury could one way on two options, and where they could find guilty on one and not on the other."
1984.83-1307,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.399,1737.62,"Mine is... I asked you if, under the judge's instruction, the jury was of the opinion that these were two separate crimes, wouldn't it be all right?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1737.62,1747.427,"--I don't think in terms of the charge here, because the charge was cocaine, Your Honor, and I don't think that they can substitute qualudes for cocaine."
1984.83-1307,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1747.427,1751.528,You just said so; that the judge... that was the judge's instruction.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1751.528,1751.879,No.
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1840.569,1841.608,But how does that affect the Dunn issue?
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1843.037,1846.169,"--Well, I think it affects the posture of this case before the Court."
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.169,1848.342,But how does it affect the Dunn issue?
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1848.342,1849.672,"The Dunn issue, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.146,1889.008,"But, counsel, the same... did the same counsel argue on appeal as tried the case?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1889.008,1890.04,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.848,1951.89,"The Court of Appeals ruled against you on this point, didn't they?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1951.89,1952.439,"--No, they didn't, Your Honor."
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.224,1961.175,"Well, then why are you addressing it here?"
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1961.175,1980.258,"Because I'm citing Wood v. Georgia, where the Court had a similar situation, where it was a matter not noticed until it hit this Court, where the imperfection of counsel, the potential for conflict, in this case we feel an adjudication of conflict has been made, and therefore it's somewhat questionable why this Court is here."
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.811,1986.623,So you're just kind of running through a whole string of things.
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1986.623,1993.518,I cannot... I cannot accept the Court's characterization.
1984.83-1307,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.688,2013.871,"Yes, but I think what you're submitting now wouldn't support the Ninth Circuit's judgment."
1984.83-1307,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2020.573,2026.457,"Your Honor, I'm saying... and that's a... I have petitioned for cert in this case, and the Court denied cert on the petition, her petition."
1984.83-1307,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.431,2063.192,"Very well, Mr. Clearly."
1984.83-1307,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2064.572,2066.745,"Just a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1307,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2235.088,2237.191,"Thank you, gentlemen."
