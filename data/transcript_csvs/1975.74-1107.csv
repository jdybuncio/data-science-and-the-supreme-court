1975.74-1107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.282,"We will hear arguments next in Nevada against the United States, consolidated with Cappaert against the United States."
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,35.87,40.363,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.517,206.226,"The first rule of law to which you refer i.e. that while reserving the land, the United States back as in the late 19th century, 1877, ceded jurisdiction over nonnavigable waters to the states."
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,212.604,213.144,That is correct.
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.144,215.317,It did not cede the waters to the state?
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,215.317,215.782,It did not.
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,221.448,231.82,"And what public, are you saying that it also ceded or conveyed or gave up to the Federal Property?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,231.82,246.712,"Well, in the California Power cases Court said that the Congress by those acts had severed land from the water and that the water then would belong to the public to be given out as provided by the several states."
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.712,248.886,"And to what public, the Federal public or population of the states?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,248.886,250.2,No.
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,264.647,289.899,"But prior in 1877, the Federal Government under your submission or prior at least to sometime of that 19th century, the Federal Government and the territories had jurisdiction over the land and the water to apply its Federal Law to the ownership of the land and water and also, do you concede, had ownership of both land and water?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,289.899,306.901,"I concede that at some point, the Federal Government had ownership of both land and the water, but the California Power Case, that doctrine enunciated there said by 1877 at the latest there was a severance of water and land and jurisdiction ceded to the states."
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,308.876,311.904,"Jurisdiction to determine who did on the water, was that it?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,311.904,316.099,"No, jurisdiction to determine who was entitled to the water."
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.099,318.413,"Well, who had the water rights?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,318.413,321.395,The right to beneficial use of that water.
1975.74-1107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.395,330.768,"Jurisdiction to determine that, but no rights in and off themselves, except the right to decide, is that it?"
1975.74-1107,0,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,330.768,338.894,It said it belonged to the public and to be given out pursuant to the laws of the several states interpreted --
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,1767.474,1771.883,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1107,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.602,1819.295,Mr. Allison would you expand on that a little bit.
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,1826.876,1829.299,"No, not necessarily."
1975.74-1107,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.053,2003.192,"I gather from the brief filed by the State of Arizona that the city of Tucson is entirely dependent on underground water, pumped water not just for irrigation, but for domestic water use?"
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2003.192,2026.353,"That is my understanding of Arizona’s position and I assume that is true and I do not find that hard to believe because if the Justices are familiar with the State of Nevada, the three populations or I should say two-and-half population centers that we have are located in areas where there is access to water right next to federally reserved land and the underground water is just becoming a major source of water."
1975.74-1107,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.306,2048.752,Give me another example where a so called prior reserved right would seriously interfere with the states?
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2048.752,2049.109,You mean --
1975.74-1107,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.109,2064.373,"Besides this case, I could understand how it operates in this case, but just, using -- setting aside a national forest or something like that, there usually who does not imply reserving any water other than what the falls on it and runs on?"
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2064.373,2068.918,I might briefly give an example and I do not know what I am quoting the facts of this case.
1975.74-1107,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.542,2122.243,For what?
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2122.243,2126.779,"Because they own the land from the water comes, because they reserve the forest."
1975.74-1107,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.779,2131.324,"They are claiming they have some rights in the water, downstream water?"
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2131.324,2134.157,I do not want to get into position of saying that I know the government’s argument.
1975.74-1107,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.238,2139.135,"But in any way, you have other argument in your states with the government over reserved rights?"
1975.74-1107,1,24909,george_allison,,2139.135,2143.718,Yes we have a very clear argument on surface water and the Pyramid lake in Ickes.
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,2945.344,2947.788,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-1107,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2947.788,2950.814,They have used their time up completely.
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,2950.814,2954.276,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.898,3211.085,"What do they do if anything for humanity, Mr. Randolph?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3211.085,3218.252,"Let me read what Dr. Fister, who was one of the biologists that testified Mr. Justice."
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.323,3252.185,"What about, you know, I mean, the fact that there are a number of graduates who maybe interested in the archaeological history, there may be a perfectly useful human occupation, but is there anything else?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3252.185,3252.702,Yes.
1975.74-1107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3285.089,3291.385,It does not sound like a very rosy future if each was one inch long—[Laughter]
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3291.385,3291.584,I do not think we --
1975.74-1107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.584,3295.321,It would be -- dying within a year.
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3295.321,3298.123,"Well, this case is about the extinction of species of fish."
1975.74-1107,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.452,3351.537,"Mr. Randolph, does the record tell us why the government reserved 40 acres, I take it the pool is only 65 feet long?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3351.537,3362.875,"I think the surrounding area of the rocks and everything, the directive in the act was to reserve the smallest area consistent with maintaining it."
1975.74-1107,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.022,3380.586,"So, is it conceivable to take out Mr. Lionel’s argument that this is the area from which the President intended to exclude wells, thinking this would be sufficient to protect the pool?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3380.586,3386.423,"No, I do not think that is conceivable and I will explain why later in my argument."
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.286,3663.456,"Given the water table, certainly that requirement could be a proscription against pumping if the water table gets low enough?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3663.456,3673.293,"I would refer you Mr. Justice Rehnquist the special master's reports, one of which I filed which shows the hours of pumping from the wells at the Cappaerts ranch."
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3692.256,3709.077,"Well supposing Mr. Cappaert turns on those pumps that are covered by the injunction and the special master learns that the water in the pool diminishes down below the three -- of the three-foot mark, then how is the mandate of the injunction carried out?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3709.077,3711.868,"Well, he has to stop pumping until the water level recovers."
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3711.868,3717.456,"And if it does not recover for several weeks that is a proscription against pumping for several weeks, does it not?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3717.456,3719.525,I am talking on a yearly basis.
1975.74-1107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3722.823,3730.333,"Well and if it is a critical time for irrigating a crop not being able to pump for several weeks, maybe the same is not being able to pump all year?"
1975.74-1107,2,40343,raymond_randolph,,3730.333,3732.015,"Well, that may be."
