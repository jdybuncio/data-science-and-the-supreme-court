1977.77-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.69,287.898,"Mr. Barnes, I just have one question there."
1977.77-454,0,20550,donald_k_barnes,,292.817,295.305,We do not owe any tax more than we already paid?
1977.77-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,295.305,297.415,But why did you have to pay any at all?
1977.77-454,0,20550,donald_k_barnes,,297.415,303.688,"Because Mr. Justice Stevens, the statute imposing tax is not unconstitutional."
1977.77-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.527,316.307,But you say that the constitution mandates the three-partite formula that you used in filling out your returns?
1977.77-454,0,20550,donald_k_barnes,,316.307,324.592,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, we do not call on the Court to impose a formula or perform any other legislative function."
1977.77-454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.234,351.235,"If that is correct then, as my brother Stevens has indicated, you would owe no tax under the Iowa statute and yet you voluntarily paid the tax, did you not?"
1977.77-454,0,20550,donald_k_barnes,,351.235,353.351,I would not go that far Mr. Justice Stewart.
1977.77-454,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1831.027,1835.063,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.645,1873.893,What do you mean by facial constitutionality?
1977.77-454,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1873.893,1888.248,I believe that facial constitutionality means that it must be unconstitutional under all conceivable circumstances.
1977.77-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.037,1903.425,"That is really over breadth you are talking about, is it not?"
1977.77-454,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1903.425,1905.275,"Yes, I believe the whole case is over breadth."
1977.77-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.275,1909.282,"Well, that is only going to apply in the First Amendment area, has it not?"
1977.77-454,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1919.456,1923.166,"No, maybe I am being misunderstood."
1977.77-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.745,1935.709,"Well, you did not have to buy that, did you?"
1977.77-454,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1935.709,1945.093,"No, we do not and our trial judge in Iowa held that it was unconstitutional under all conceivable circumstances."
1977.77-454,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3559.481,3561.632,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-454,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3615.353,3616.399,"Thank you, gentlemen."
