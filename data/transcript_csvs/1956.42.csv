1956.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,5.557,-- John W. Webb versus (Inaudible).
1956.42,0,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,6.709,6.977,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1956.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6.977,10.998,-- you may proceed.
1956.42,0,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,10.998,12.911,May it please the Court.
1956.42,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,416.449,421.982,Was it -- was it of a size that they passed through the firebox breaks?
1956.42,0,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,421.982,424.123,"It was a fist size one, Your Honor."
1956.42,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,427.845,428.832,"Of course, we don't know where (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.42,0,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,428.832,429.673,"No, we don't Your Honor."
1956.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,844.61,854.615,Mr. Deany.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,854.615,861.158,May it please the Court and Mr. Rafferty.
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,981.525,982.653,Will you excuse me just a moment?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,982.911,982.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,982.94,984.822,-- didn't quite get your point there.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,984.822,986.227,"All right, Your Honor."
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,986.227,992.649,"The question was, “Well, now, in any particular -- is any particular use made of larger cinders if any are found?”"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1008.243,1008.929,"I say, Your Honor --"
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1008.929,1009.891,-- meant?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1009.891,1010.777,Pardon me.
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1010.777,1011.808,Yes.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1011.808,1020.578,"Mr. Chief Justice, I say that he testified here that two inches in diameter would be about the largest that they would use customarily."
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1029.943,1030.173,Yes.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1030.173,1040.553,"And incidentally, a cinder about the size of a normal man's fist is considerably larger than two inches in diameter."
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1049.532,1051.337,Yes.
1956.42,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1051.337,1059.979,"But doesn't that just simply lead to the fact that they recognized it, there were some larger cinders around there, if there were, they shouldn't be there and yet, this one was there?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1059.979,1062.861,"I would say not, Mr. Justice."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1073.749,1075.403,He said he buried it.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1075.403,1078.433,"He said he buried, that's correct, buried it or in other way, this --"
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1078.433,1079.183,(Voice Overlap) either way?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1079.183,1080.524,"Either way, dispose of them."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1082.356,1082.542,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1082.542,1084.821,-- that he would not use them in the right-of-way.
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1084.821,1087.453,Next (Inaudible) was to haul them away.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1087.453,1088.379,That's right.
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1088.379,1093.693,So if he buried them evidently that refers to burying (Inaudible) right-of-way itself.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1093.693,1099.091,"Well, then, it was the next question then, if you please, Mr. Justice Clark."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1108.687,1120.233,"No, I was just wondering whether or not the answer there, if it came across the center was over two inches, that would mean that they sometimes buried them right there --"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1120.233,1120.582,"Oh, no, no."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1120.582,1122.568,(Voice Overlap) less than two inches.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1122.568,1128.252,"No, he says that -- he said he makes a hole and puts them in there, a hole in some place or hauls them away."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1132.483,1133.562,(Inaudible)
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1133.562,1134.566,"Yes, that's right."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1134.566,1135.154,Why?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1136.93,1145.605,"Well, for the very simple reason, it might make an unsafe right-of-way if it's larger than that."
1956.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.605,1155.46,"Well, couldn't the jury at least -- a reasonable man differ on what he meant by -- when -- when he said bury them --"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1155.46,1155.703,I would --
1956.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1155.703,1161.111,-- that a reasonable man differ whether he meant bury them in the right-of-way or somewhere else?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1161.111,1175.45,"I would think not, Your Honor, but in particular, would that be true, Your Honor, where he goes on to say, ""Are the largest cinders ever used in raising the track,"" this job was a track raising operation."
1956.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.45,1176.39,"Yes, but even -- even with that."
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1176.39,1177.289,Yes.
1956.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.142,1188.796,Do you think it would be unreasonable for a juror to infer from that (Voice Overlap) --
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1188.796,1196.901,"I certainly do but I don't know anything if it'd be unreasonable, Your Honor, but I think it would be absolutely contrary to the affirmative evidence in the record."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1196.901,1202.485,I thought the evidence was (Inaudible) cinders used in that particular track.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1202.485,1221.992,There is one question there that he does say that that -- those cinders and that chat was picked up on the passing track which is north of the switch leading to -- from the main line to the house track.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1337.495,1339.614,Did he say he saw every clinker?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1339.614,1342.284,"He said he saw every shovel full, Mr. Justice Black.[Laughter]"
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1342.284,1344.062,"He didn't say he saw every clinker, did he?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1344.062,1354.474,"No, that would be quite a job there, Your Honor, [Laughter] to see every clinker in the rail of right-of-way because there are millions and millions and oceans of clinkers in the railroad of right-of-way."
1956.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1372.923,1388.829,"Well, there again might reasonable men not differ though from the fact that this concession that they were not screened, whether or not the steps taken to prevent the oversized clinkers getting into the roadbed are adequate for the purpose?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1388.829,1397.709,Reasonable men might if there were some basis for it or if -- if the evidence was not such as to overcome that possibility.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1403.124,1407.003,Was there evidence that he fell over a clinker?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1407.003,1410.112,The evidence of the plaintiff is that he fell over a clinker.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1410.401,1418.581,And I understand your evidence shows that one that's not big enough to be dangerous wouldn't be dangerous to a man so he wouldn't fall over it.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1418.581,1425.969,"Well, which would indicate that the clinker probably wasn't the size of the man's fist, Your Honor."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1428.301,1437.99,"But if there's evidence that he fell over a clinker and they don't fall over them, don't fall over them, if -- that's normal and that would be evidence that they were not that small, wasn't it?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1437.99,1440.623,That would be not necessarily.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1440.623,1441.7,"That would be an inference, wouldn't it, if (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1441.7,1444.415,Not necessary.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1452.164,1456.082,I understood you to say there was evidence that he fell over a clinker.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1456.082,1457.112,"Well, that's what he testified to, Your Honor --"
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1457.112,1457.583,"Well, that's if --"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1457.583,1458.602,-- and we got to admit that.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1458.602,1464.515,And there's also evidence that a man is not likely to fall over a clinker that's small.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1464.515,1464.876,The evidence --
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1464.876,1466.908,"That's your -- that's your defense, isn't it?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1466.908,1468.692,"No, it isn't, not by any means."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1468.692,1472.722,"Well, one of your defense is this that they were so small, they were not dangerous, isn't it?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1472.722,1477.115,"Well, the testimony and that's the standard of railroading."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1491.616,1491.904,Not dangerous --
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1491.904,1492.344,And --
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1492.344,1493.173,-- you mean?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1493.173,1493.66,Pardon me?
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1493.66,1495.103,You mean not dangerous?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1495.103,1498.4,I mean that it's acceptable according to the custom --
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1498.4,1498.924,"Well, do you mean -- you mean --"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1498.924,1499.751,-- and the standard.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1499.751,1500.52,Is it dangerous?
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1502.863,1510.113,There isn't any evidence that two-inch in diameter rock is dangerous.
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1510.299,1510.31,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1510.31,1515.418,"-- evidence here that a rock, the size of a man's fist, might be dangerous."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1515.418,1520.874,"Whether -- whether that would be one less than two inches, is there evidence that it's dangerous or not dangerous?"
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1520.874,1532.721,"The evidence is that according to the standard of maintenance of track railroad, they use it and use it in accordance with the standard practice of railroad."
1956.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1532.721,1536.725,"Well, then, there is no evidence whether it's dangerous or not dangerous."
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1536.725,1542.473,"No, not -- not in that pretty terms, Your Honor, I would say."
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1542.588,1552.697,"Well, those that you mention so are so dangerous that they haul them away and put them into some other place wherein they never use it."
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1552.697,1553.45,That's right.
1956.42,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1556.601,1561.287,They only did the screening to see that there wasn't any in there.
1956.42,1,26868,herbert_j_deany,,1561.287,1576.174,A -- the record shows that he looked at the screening before he picked it up and that the screenings were in good condition and a record further shows that he examined every shovel full of the ballast whether it was being loaded on the pushcart.
1956.42,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1585.756,1586.256,But the clinker --
1956.42,2,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,2797.55,2798.329,"I have only several points, Your Honor --"
1956.42,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2798.329,2799.084,-- Rafferty.
1956.42,2,40277,robert_j_rafferty,,2799.084,2800.559,-- I would like to raise.
