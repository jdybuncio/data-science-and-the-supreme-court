2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.48,We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1194 Packingham v. North Carolina. Mr. Goldberg.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,7.48,33.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three principal features of North Carolina's law that make it a stark abridgement of the Freedom of Speech. First, Section 202.5 reaches vast swaths of core First Amendment activity that is totally unrelated to the government's preventative purpose. Mr. Packingham is not accused of communicating with or viewing the profile of a minor."
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,70.65,72.55,Please go ahead.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,73.36,83.815,"-- is a criminal law, Your Honor, that imposes punishment for protected First Amendment activity without any regard to individual culpability or lack of culpability."
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.815,88.275,Could a State impose this restriction as a condition of parole?
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,88.275,100.015,"Your Honor, I think they have much more authority to impose things as a condition of parole, and -- and States do this all the time, and they -- they -- they limit people's First Amendment rights."
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.67,109.34,But --
2016.15-1194,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,109.34,109.77,Didn't --
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.77,110.43,But they are --
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.43,112.975,Justice Ginsburg.
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.975,126.3,The most fundamental right is taken away from ex -- fundamentals by some -- some States prohibit ex-felons from voting.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,134.305,134.99,"Right, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,195.33,206.38,It's a little difficult to -- you said look at the text and history. We don't have a lot of history here concerning access to websites and all the sort of things we're dealing with here.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,208.9,210.36,"I agree, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.97,242.895,"My point is, though, you don't have a lot of history of having -- having such sites or access where they can provide broad access to minors of the sort that is problematic with respect to this individual."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,242.895,257.47,"Well, I don't disagree -- we know as with violent video games, as with any manner of new technologies the Court has confronted, there isn't -- there isn't a framing era or -- or reconstruction-era analogue."
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,269.64,277.52,Suppose we try to translate this into terms that would be familiar at the time of the adoption of the First Amendment.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,290.945,296.48,"I don't think so, Your Honor. Obviously, at the framing, the First Amendment didn't apply to the states."
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,297.39,298.37,All right.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,299.15,299.33,All right.
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,299.33,301.08,-- in the District of Columbia.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,301.08,307.9,"So, Your Honor, the -- a kindergarten -- first of all, I don't know that there's a First Amendment right to visit a kindergarten."
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.965,320.24,Suppose --
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,320.24,320.65,When some --
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.65,332.245,Suppose the law simply said that someone who was a sex offender could not communicate with a minor on social media.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,336.075,347.08,"Well, I think my first answer is that it would be much less restrictive, and that shows why this law is unconstitutional; right? And that's exactly what the prosecutor --"
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.08,347.17,Well --
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,347.17,347.56,If you look at the --
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.56,349.315,"Well, there's a -- there's a concern here --"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,349.315,349.71,Sure.
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.71,350.94,-- for the safety of children.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,356.125,356.57,I think --
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.57,358.275,-- and no communication with a minor?
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,358.275,360.42,"So I -- I think it probably would be, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,399.96,425.505,"But you think that even as narrowly tailored as Justice Ginsburg's example, so it would be a crime for a convicted sex offender -- or let's say someone who was convicted previously of committing a sex offense using the Internet from contacting on the Internet a person who is known -- known by that person to be a minor without the consent of the parents of the minor? That would be a violation of the First Amendment?"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,425.505,425.71,No.
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,428.27,429.36,"Oh, I thought you said it wouldn't be."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,429.36,431.865,I'm sorry if I -- if I wasn't clear about that.
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,479.18,490.475,"What do you think your best argument is? Is this statute too overbroad? Does it fail scrutiny, whatever level we adopt? What's the --"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,490.475,491.47,"Well, I -- I think --"
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,491.47,493.78,What do you think -- I know you say all of those things.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,493.78,494.15,Yes.
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.42,501.97,"Elizabeth Barrett Browning, ""Let me count the ways."""
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,501.97,503.19,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.51,528.96,But -- but let me ask you: Suppose there were an app -- a program in which officers could monitor your -- your video and your -- and your -- and your cyber -- and your cyber equipment and disclose if you are communicating with minors.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,537.26,544.65,"Well, I think that goes to the question of -- which you don't need to answer and I want to answer Justice Sotomayor's question as well in this case."
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.32,582.11,"First Amendment for home run, who hit the home run?"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,582.11,583.75,"I'm saying for the State, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,601.49,602.0,"Well, I take it --"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,602.0,602.73,-- have no problem whatsoever.
2016.15-1194,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,602.73,608.61,"I take it, Mr. Goldberg, that a part of what the State is saying here is that it doesn't have the capacity to do that."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,628.315,628.64,Sure.
2016.15-1194,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,628.64,632.055,"-- in the polling places, that's kind of a prophylactic rule."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,635.215,651.24,"Well -- well, Your Honor, we -- obviously, there are times when prophylactic rules are permissible under the First Amendment. Mr. Packingham, when he was convicted, got a condition that said you shall not have any contact with the specific victim of this crime."
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.95,686.21,What is -- what was your answer? Which I forget.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,699.85,701.59,I -- I think that's constitutional because --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.59,702.04,All right.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,702.04,702.47,I -- I don't --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,702.47,710.565,"If that's constitutional, instead of what most of the briefs do, is interpret the statute as broadly as possible, this is a facial challenge."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,759.01,761.345,"Well, Your Honor, a couple points."
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.97,771.03,Yeah.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,778.19,778.45,And then --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.45,786.82,"But I'm really interested in the narrow possibility of interpreting it narrowly, as I said."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,794.11,796.77,"So, Your Honor, this is a criminal case."
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.49,807.8,You're not -- you're not attacking the statute.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,810.765,821.71,"In a criminal case, you -- the Court has the power to say -- and I think it's appropriate in this case -- that this -- the problem here is the problem for every application."
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.085,823.34,Okay.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,823.34,823.76,And clearly --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.76,825.805,That's -- then we're back to my question.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,830.28,830.37,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.37,831.88,I want to get your answer to the question.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,831.88,832.055,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.13,854.49,Wait.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,870.26,870.9,Sure.
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,870.9,879.025,-- seems to be talking about dating sites or the lower age level equivalent.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,879.025,879.93,I don't --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.93,898.285,"If -- if that's -- it does what it says, facilities the social introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons or related information exchanges. I've now got it a social dating or equivalent site."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,898.285,898.665,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.665,906.02,"I think I can say that. Now, if I say that, is it constitutional? That's what I'm trying to get your answer to."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,906.02,910.54,"If -- if it were limited to dating sites, I'm assuming that it is constitutional, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,916.31,918.39,"Well, they couldn't because of your case."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,918.39,918.55,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.04,921.88,So your case involved boasting about getting off a traffic ticket.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,921.88,922.295,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,928.1,938.455,"So then the answer to this would be they have not applied it that way here, and given the way they've applied it here, they can't do that."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,938.455,938.85,I don't --
2016.15-1194,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.85,940.89,"Now, we're going to have 40 other cases involved."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,940.89,941.99,I don't think they've ever applied it.
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,962.975,996.8,"Yeah, the -- the interpretation that Justice Breyer -- the -- the language that Justice Breyer is referring to and other language in this statute, I think, could, for the purpose of avoiding First Amendment problems, be limited to core social networking sites, including Facebook and things like Facebook, Google Plus, that sort of thing, and excluding a lot of the other sites that the electronic frontier says are included, like the New York Times and Betty Crocker and things like that."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1008.36,1015.58,"So honestly, Your Honor, I'm not sure that it can, but it's very important for the constitutional question that that is irrelevant."
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1025.38,1027.37,"Well, just to put it in -- in context."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1035.74,1036.085,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1036.085,1036.795,Okay.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1036.795,1037.84,So --
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1037.84,1041.91,Even if it were limited to -- to those --
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1041.91,1042.0,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1042.0,1043.05,You would say it's unconstitutional.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1043.05,1059.49,"Our -- our position -- and for the very reason we've talked about, which is that this -- just like the law in the Jews For Jesus airport case from Los Angeles that said no First Amendment activity in this place, this is a law that says no First Amendment activity, and it says it indiscriminate, so --"
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.49,1068.95,"Counsel, I mean, one of my problems with all of these sites today is that none of them are purely -- or very few of them are purely anything anymore."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1068.95,1069.44,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1069.44,1091.61,"Take something like LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today are looking for jobs there, but high school students are permitted to look for jobs and to post their data, personal data on that site. So, is that traditional social media or not?"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1091.61,1096.4,I -- I think the State says that it is because it meets the definition. I just want to get back to Justice Alito's question --
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1096.4,1103.76,"But that's my point, which is -- I'm -- Facebook, many people, many businesses are using it for commercial advertising."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1103.76,1104.05,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1120.72,1121.3,Even if you don't --
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1121.3,1140.77,"Well, all of -- all of these questions implicate what Justice Sotomayor asked earlier and I and others interrupted you. What is the category that we use? If -- if we rule for you, we say this statute is a violation of the First Amendment because, what -- what are -- what are the basic rules or the basic --"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1140.77,1141.93,So -- so the basic rules --
2016.15-1194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.93,1146.84,-- doctrinal choices you offer us to say why this is unconstitutional?
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1146.84,1147.32,Sure.
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1231.62,1249.59,"Well, one of the -- I mean, under narrow tailoring, I think it's -- it's incumbent upon you to come up with a narrow -- more narrowly tailored alternative. So if you wanted to -- you're in the North Carolina legislature and you're told you can't do this, what would you do as the most effective alternative?"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1249.59,1262.08,"Well -- well, Your Honor, I -- I think the opinion in McCullen said it was not incumbent on the challenger to come up with the alternative, but here it -- it said the State has to show that it seriously considered alternatives, but --"
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1262.08,1270.73,What -- I thought you agreed with me earlier that North Carolina could ban communicating with a minor --
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1270.73,1271.22,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.22,1272.17,-- via social media.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1272.17,1272.43,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1273.33,1285.48,"Well, I guess in response to that is, well, how do you know that it's -- that it's a minor or -- or how is the -- I -- I mean, I assume that minors can put on -- they -- they don't have to have their age in their e-mail."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1291.02,1291.525,Right.
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1292.02,1293.79,-- message that's put on the site.
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1298.405,1301.13,So -- so two -- two answers to that.
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1341.12,1343.4,Maybe he doesn't say it because it wouldn't work.

The -- the premise -- one of the things that the State argues about effectiveness is that this law will prevent people from doing something."
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1404.93,1408.82,"Mr. -- Mr. Goldberg, why was your client using an alias?"
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1408.82,1410.17,I -- I think --
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.17,1415.25,If he -- if he wasn't lurking or otherwise trying to stay hidden?
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1415.25,1418.69,"So, Your Honor, he wasn't lurking."
2016.15-1194,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1470.02,1494.465,"Go back to Justice Kennedy's question, if you would, which is, is there a capacity to determine the age of a user; meaning, is there a way for the State to be able to track whether or not a potential defendant is actually in communication with a minor."
2016.15-1194,0,20903,david_t_goldberg,,1494.465,1504.56,"Well, two things, Your Honor. This statute -- the State's description of the statute has always -- they already have a law about communicating using the Internet with a minor."
2016.15-1194,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.62,1541.325,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Montgomery."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1541.325,1589.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For many years, North Carolina, like other States, had laws prohibiting sex offenders from being at physical places where children congregate; schools, playgrounds, day cares, and parks. In 2008, North Carolina decided to prohibit sex offenders from being at virtual places where children congregate online; specifically, commercial social networking websites. North Carolina passed Section 202.5 to cover the people most likely to sexually assault children. Unlike some of the other alternatives -- or unlike the alternatives proposed, this law is enforceable and effective. One of the things that was said --"
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1589.0,1595.57,"Social networking, it includes Facebook, obviously; it includes LinkedIn; it includes Twitter; is that right?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1595.57,1596.985,That -- that would be correct.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1596.985,1609.485,"So -- so a -- so a person in this situation, for example, cannot go onto the President's Twitter account to find out what the President is saying today?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1609.485,1612.04,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1612.04,1613.16,Not only the President.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1638.85,1639.73,That's right.
2016.15-1194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1646.65,1673.71,"Well, it seems to me, I don't know if -- that we ever did have a public square, but assuming we had a public square a hundred years ago, could you say that this person couldn't go into the public square? The -- the sites that Justice Kagan has described and their utility and their -- and their -- extent of their coverage are -- are greater than the communication you could ever had, even in the paradigm of public square."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1673.71,1683.09,"In essence, States have said that sex offenders can't go into the public square; that they can't go into parks or they can't go into -- can't go near playgrounds."
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.09,1685.23,Maybe those have the same problem.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1746.38,1746.94,No.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.07,1762.55,What about all the orders -- about all the ways you just listed that they have all the statutes would say you can't approach children and say certain things.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1763.995,1764.64,Certainly.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.28,1769.545,What's the difference?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1769.545,1771.55,"Well, there really is no big difference."
2016.15-1194,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.46,1808.15,"Are you able to find out from the site operators, from Facebook, who one of the registered offenders is communicating with?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1808.15,1808.24,There --
2016.15-1194,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.24,1811.05,To the extent --
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1811.05,1819.27,"-- there may be some instances in which that would happen, but most of these sites have an Instant Messenger feature or some kind of messenger feature which doesn't show up."
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1827.01,1837.715,I thought that Facebook didn't allow -- didn't allow access by former sex offenders.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1837.715,1839.7,"That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1844.77,1847.375,"But that's Facebook's choice, it's not the State."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1847.375,1848.32,That's correct.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1886.29,1888.71,"But -- but -- I mean, yes, that narrows it."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1935.365,1938.51,"There -- there are other alternatives, still."
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.79,1989.14,"But you're not making a conduct speech distinction, are you? I thought you had dropped that in your briefs."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1989.14,1989.45,No.
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.78,2017.985,How was -- how was he apprehended?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2017.985,2032.445,The -- the officer went to his own Facebook account and had a -- had a list of sex offenders that he was searching for using their names or aliases or family members.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.03,2072.759,Can you have a statute says convicted swindlers cannot go on Facebook -- or cannot go on the Internet on sites that tell people -- that tell people where to gather to discuss money?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2072.759,2075.39,I'm not sure about that --
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.39,2077.19,"I mean, I can multiply these examples."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2078.24,2079.03,Certainly.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.03,2085.305,"We can think of -- you know, pretty soon, you're going to have everybody convicted of different things not being able to go anywhere and discuss anything."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2085.305,2085.82,Well --
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.82,2086.99,I exaggerate.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2091.865,2094.58,"Well, swindlers are not sex offenders, and that's --"
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2094.58,2095.68,Does that make a difference?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2095.68,2096.11,Yes.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.11,2096.17,Why?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2096.17,2097.18,It does make a difference.
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.18,2097.29,Why?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2097.29,2108.16,"Sex offenders have -- have been -- there have been civil disabilities applied to sex offenders and to other felons, but certainly to sex offenders, such as the registry itself."
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2141.12,2148.04,"Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I ask you a question that has to do with the law's exemptions? Because it just confused me when I was reading it."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2171.04,2179.12,The -- the legislature in North Carolina wanted to have some narrow tailoring to this -- to this statute.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2187.63,2196.86,It just seems to exempt the stuff that's most easily used to -- to do exactly the things that this statute is meant to prevent.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2196.86,2211.85,"Well, this statute is -- is meant to prevent at its core harvesting of information anonymously, which is not something you find as much when you're talking about chat rooms or -- or e-mail or those sorts of things."
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2225.33,2225.68,Could --
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2225.68,2225.86,And so --
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2225.86,2233.115,-- North Carolina -- could North Carolina bar those as well? Bar the photo sharing and the chat room?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2233.115,2239.12,The problem then may be that it would not be as narrowly tailored as it should be.
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.12,2252.915,"Then what did you mean in your brief when you said that North Carolina can proceed one step at a time, that it could take further steps consistent with constitutional --"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2252.915,2259.25,"Well, certainly, there are other steps that may be taken, and perhaps that would be one."
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.06,2269.69,"Well, what did you mean in your brief, then, when you said North Carolina could take other steps, additional steps?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2269.69,2276.835,There -- there are -- there are certainly other laws that could be put in place to try to prevent sex offenders from finding out information.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2276.835,2290.39,"When you just said to Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be unconstitutional if they included these things that are instead exempted, so you mean that there's a constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use Twitter?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2290.39,2300.83,I'm not sure I understand. That -- that Snapchat -- Snapchat and Twitter seem to be included under this statute.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2300.83,2305.2,"Well, I would have -- I would have thought that Snapchat is -- is -- maybe I have it wrong."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2308.98,2310.96,I believe that is some of it.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2311.19,2311.37,Yeah.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2315.56,2321.42,"Well, Snapchat, as I understand it, you don't get the level of information that you get from something else."
2016.15-1194,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.15,2363.855,Look -- look: The case books are filled with cases where to allow certain groups of people to speak is actually dangerous.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2422.37,2435.995,"This case is much more like Burson v. Freeman, in which this Court said that this 100-foot buffer zone, that a campaign-free zone at a voting place was permissible."
2016.15-1194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2439.85,2444.935,I -- I think that's -- does not help you at -- at all. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.935,2447.93,"That was -- number one, it was applied to everyone."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2459.975,2462.12,"Well, the only -- the reason --"
2016.15-1194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2462.12,2464.18,"If you cite Burson, I think -- I think you lose."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2464.18,2476.1,The reason that that case is the one that I mentioned is because the rationale for that was that these kinds of crimes that happened in that zone often go undetected --
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2476.1,2478.06,"Mr. Montgomery, I agree with you."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2511.905,2519.01,"Well, the fact that it applied to all in Burson, I believe, makes our case a better case because it doesn't apply to all."
2016.15-1194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.97,2539.34,"Well, that was -- that was not the rationale of Burson v. Freeman."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2559.505,2563.55,But it wouldn't be like singling out a political party.
2016.15-1194,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2587.68,2595.54,Is -- is a provision like this ever added to the sentences as opposed to following from the sex registry?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2595.54,2608.89,"As -- as part of probation, there can be certainly those sorts of provisions added for the length of parole, for instance, or probation. They can be a condition."
2016.15-1194,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.09,2647.685,"I suppose it's hard to generalize, but do you have any idea what the period of parole or probation is for someone who commits a sex offense such as the one at issue here?"
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2647.685,2650.55,I -- I am not sure.
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2656.605,2658.71,Not if it's a Federal crime.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2658.71,2660.31,Not if it was -- if it was a --
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2660.31,2660.98,It's much longer.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2660.98,2662.73,"If it was a Federal crime, it would be much longer."
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.73,2677.87,I -- I -- I'm still having some difficulty because you're building layer upon layer of speculation or -- or statistical inference. Yes.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2739.48,2746.46,"Well, it's -- it's often impossible to know whether the sex offenders use the Internet or not."
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2791.5,2796.72,But that might be true of every criminal today.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2796.72,2798.51,It could --
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2798.51,2800.335,Or committing almost any crime.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2800.335,2802.85,"That could be, but again, we're talking about social --"
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2802.85,2806.575,Most of them can go onto Facebook and find the location of the bank they want to rob.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2815.175,2815.98,Correct.
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2815.98,2816.54,-- by anyone.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2816.54,2833.155,"Those -- those are even more speculative as to how many people would use that. Here, we -- here we know from studies that about 82 percent of online sex crimes against children, social networking websites were used to gain information about their likes and dislikes."
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2849.395,2852.464,Can they go on the school website?
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2852.464,2855.325,They can go on the school website.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2922.55,2939.43,"How many people under 30 do you think don't use these sites to get all their information? Under 35? I mean, they're -- increasingly, this is the way people get everything that -- all information."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2939.43,2940.1,They --
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2940.1,2945.51,This is the way people structure their civic community life.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2945.51,2947.76,They -- they do get a lot of information.
2016.15-1194,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.959,3016.605,"What about the -- and there was a -- a brief -- the electronic frontier, and -- and even if -- if the New York Times is not included, the point is that these people are being cut off from a very large part of the marketplace of ideas. And the First Amendment includes not only the right to speak, but the right to receive information. I mean, you don't -- you don't question that they are being cut off."
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,3016.605,3017.34,No.
2016.15-1194,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3060.805,3087.67,"Why? I got a page here with -- printed from nytimes.com, from the New York Times, where on the side there's commentary by people who have created profiles on themselves having a public discussion between them on a news article that was printed in the New York Times."

2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3112.9,3118.12,Where is that in the statute? Because I don't read the statute to impose that as a requirement.
2016.15-1194,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,3119.58,3119.89,Certainly.
2016.15-1194,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3130.49,3130.71,Right.
