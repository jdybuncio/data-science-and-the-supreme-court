1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.665,"Number 199, George B. Harris, Judge of United States District Court for the Northern District of California, petitioner, versus Louis S. Nelson, Warden."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,25.296,29.994,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,269.595,282.388,May I ask you whether there's any indication on the record here as to which theory the District Court used in ordering that the interrogatories be answered?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,282.388,283.706,"No, there is not, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,283.706,286.035,You don't know as we --
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,286.035,286.212,No --
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,286.212,296.211,"In this case, whether that the Court felt compelled to do so by the rules or whether the Court was acting as a matter discretionary power?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,296.211,298.12,"No, there is no indication whatsoever."
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,706.227,710.108,"I mean -- you mean, full sweep of the discovery rules?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,710.108,718.87,"Yes, Your Honor, every discovery rule, other than, I believe, one has been reported in use in District Courts or in Circuit Court in this country."
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.87,724.461,A full sweep of the rule as ordinarily applicable to a Civil Court?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,724.461,733.195,"Well, the full extent of the rules but, when you say full sweep, it doesn't necessarily mean that it would work the same way it would in a civil proceeding."
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.049,748.822,Can you illustrate that?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,748.822,766.331,"Yes, this particular problem arises from the argument by the state that abuse would occur if certain of the rules, the discovery rules, were permitted in habeas corpus."
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.709,834.41,"Now that -- that's not an unfamiliar argument, anyway, in a matter of discovery generally, is it?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,834.41,836.528,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1000.813,1004.594,I gather you might be opposed to this argument.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1014.507,1015.514,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1015.514,1020.751,On the application of the discovery rule and the civil rule.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1020.751,1021.225,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1021.225,1025.776,"There aren't any comparable restraints to the ordinary civil cases, I suppose."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1025.776,1026.151,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.151,1032.75,"So that in the ordinary civil case, one files a complaint and I decide that this goes bad without Court order."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1032.75,1034.582,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1034.582,1035.765,It proceeds to discovery.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1035.765,1036.404,That's exactly right.
1968.199,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1036.404,1041.594,"The complaints within the federal habeas statute has imposed these special restraint, is that it?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1041.594,1042.728,That's exactly right.
1968.199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.036,1151.15,How much discovery do you -- in the habeas that is available to a state?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1151.15,1169.022,"Well, I think that because in habeas proceedings the issue is not one of guilt or innocence and, therefore, it does not involve the self-incrimination privilege and because it is not really often one even involves the testimony of the petitioner, it's one, as in our case, as probable cause."
1968.199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.229,1215.114,"I think your Supreme Court allows some discovery in some cases, that is, must keep itself on the part of the state, notwithstanding the privilege?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1215.114,1216.844,"Yes, Mr. Justice, they have."
1968.199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.405,1287.131,Does your state allow an accused discovering the names of witnesses that state may use against?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1287.131,1288.595,"Yes, I believe that's correct."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.447,1402.497,"Of course, in an ordinary criminal case, the parties or the state as prosecutor and the defendant as the person under indictment or against too much information has been -- had a -- habeas corpus is quite different, in that, the re -- the plaintiff, the petitioner, the applicant is the man in custody and the defendant or respondent is the -- his custodian."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1405.997,1407.156,Well --
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1407.156,1414.369,"How would the custodian, the warden of the penitentiary, know anything about Frances, whatever her name was?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1415.346,1418.63,"Yes, sir."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1478.329,1490.314,"You ask -- you ask in your interrogatories, appearing on page 34 of the record, that the respondent, that is the warden of the penitentiary, answer all these questions."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1504.548,1509.415,"Yes, the warden -- again, he's named as the nominal party --"
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1509.415,1513.944,"And, that is the party to answer these questions under oath."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1513.944,1522.119,"Well, it was not construed as such, I believe, by the Court or any of the parties, Mr. Justice."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.119,1545.247,"I'm not being -- attempting my question to be technical with respect to this case, but I'm stressing my tentative question as to whether or not this might not be an additional reason why discovery procedures are not appropriate in a habeas corpus case."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1545.247,1545.585,"Well, I --"
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1545.585,1548.902,I would -- just exactly how would this work?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1558.406,1560.616,"Nominally, again, yes."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1560.956,1562.098,"Well, I mean, actually."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1562.098,1562.166,Actually --
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1562.166,1563.451,What would actually happen?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1563.451,1575.641,"Actually what will happen is that Mr. Granberg, the other persons whom we have dealt with in this case in the State Attorneys General's Office and who will be representing the state in the proceeding."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1581.532,1601.658,"Well, it's quite a different sort of thing then than the civil interrogatory because what you're doing, what the prisoner here is asking is that the state, the Commandant, to procure information for him, namely the answers to these questions."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1657.636,1661.435,"Your Honor, I don't believe that -- Mr. Justice Fortas, I don't believe that can happen."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1661.435,1663.403,You'd have to get the Court to approve.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1663.403,1665.038,"We'd have to, and we have suggested --"
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1665.038,1668.478,How about depositions upon written interrogatories?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1668.478,1669.956,The same.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1680.176,1697.076,"Well, under the civil rules, if I star -- if I'm involved in the civil suit at that time and so on, taking into account, I can just serve notice on somebody that I'm going to take his interrogatory."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1703.659,1732.358,"Ordinarily, that is the case but I don't' believe that could be the case in habeas proceedings for the simple reason that the Court on its own motion, or the parties, their state in the motion, or the petitioner if the state is seeking to inquire information from the petitioner, any of these parties can simply state that no discovery -- under Rule 30, no discovery will proceed until an evidentiary hearing has been determined to be necessary until counsel is appointed."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1732.358,1734.663,"Well, is that in the civil rules?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1734.663,1737.781,"It is supported by Rule 30, yes, Your Honor."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1738.463,1748.31,"I -- I listen with interest to your argument about Rule 30 but, actually, if you say that the civil rules apply in habeas proceedings."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1763.52,1786.972,"Yes, that's possible, but I see no burden upon that particular person other than to notify the Court that the notice has been received, and have the Court review the appropriateness of it which, in effect, in this case, means that the Court would have two possibilities."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1840.138,1854.201,Aren't you a little concern that this might turn out to be occupational therapy for jailhouse inmates with some certain amount of inconvenience to the rest of the world?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1854.201,1869.197,"I don't believe it will, Mr. Justice Fortas, and, again, because the Court could have -- jailhouse lawyers could have done so long ago if they had intended to do so in -- at least in several circuits."
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1892.242,1895.561,We'll recess now.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1895.561,1909.859,Process of reviewing objections which have been tendered by respondent to the application of appropriate federal rules or other discovery devices pursuant to inherent power to habeas corpus proceedings.
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1909.859,1912.266,Pursuant to what now?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1912.266,1918.067,Of either ha -- of procedures either through the federal rules or pursuant to inherent power.
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1918.067,1920.905,Inherent power by who?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1920.905,1934.414,"Well, that is to say, the discovery devices could be applied to habeas corpus proceedings by a District Court pursuant to its own inherent power as a separate ground from applying those rules pursuant to Rule 81."
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1934.414,1942.223,You have that in the previous vote of Congress or just the Court draw the rule?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1942.223,1943.755,"Well, I think --"
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.755,1946.381,Go through the All Writs Act.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1946.381,1961.63,"Yes, Mr. Justice, we believe that, under the inherent power authorities that we have argued, there are essentially three separate specific authorities for the use of appropriate procedures in habeas corpus."
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1983.222,1983.798,To do what?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1983.798,1984.908,In our reply brief.
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1984.908,1986.882,They have the power to do what?
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1986.882,1995.019,To act and adopt procedures pursuant to the ends of justice as they determine them to be needed in a Court.
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1995.019,2000.028,You will have better if you could hang on to some Act of Congress.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2000.028,2015.102,"Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that we would much prefer to have the rules applied pursuant to Rule 81 (a) (2) of the federal rules which is tantamount to Congressional provisions since the rules were approved by Congress."
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2096.02,2100.758,"Maybe no one else will be bothered on the Court, but it gives me trouble."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2106.111,2112.408,"But you do have an Act of Congress explicitly applicable to habeas corpus, don't you?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2116.207,2116.909,"Yes, Mr. --"
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.909,2127.286,"Which says that, on application for a writ of habeas corpus, evidence may be taken orally or by deposition or in the discretion of the judge by affidavit."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2137.562,2137.87,Yes --
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.87,2138.485,Which --
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2138.485,2144.68,"Mr. Justice Stewart, that provision, however, most definitely does not deal with discovery."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.472,2146.831,Exactly.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2148.24,2156.073,"And, for that reason, it does not control, it does not allude to, and it does not regulate discovery procedures in habeas corpus proceedings."
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2156.073,2156.709,But it does --
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2156.709,2158.505,It simply is not relevant to the present determination.
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2158.505,2167.556,"It does -- well, it does regulate and control depositions and affidavits and written interrogatories --"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2167.556,2167.984,But --
1968.199,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.984,2188.082,"With respect to the actual hearing in a habeas corpus case and does provide, in these terms, that such a hearing need not always conform to the, or follow, requirements of a criminal trial, that is, evidence may be taken by affidavit, for example, in the discretion of the judge."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2203.967,2208.518,"Well, we have -- I suppose that is arguable."
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2245.463,2264.033,"You have one argument about habeas corpus that I'm not sure you make, that's a constitutional remedy and it might be more inherent power, extra constitutional remedy, which is given to the Court that it would be in connection with other matters."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2264.033,2274.832,I believe that is true. I think that that would support our position that inherent power is a valid ground for sustaining the order below.
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2274.832,2280.314,"Yes, up close to the question as to whether Congress could do away with habeas corpus."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2280.314,2285.725,I believe that's impossible if I read the Suspension Clause correctly in the Constitution.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2289.373,2294.51,"Mr. Pottinger, I am having a little difficulty understanding --"
1968.199,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2294.51,2295.231,So do we.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2295.231,2302.089,Why the written interrogatory procedure would not be effective for you here.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2317.467,2319.579,They would not be available even then.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2319.579,2320.338,I know.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2320.338,2320.398,Right.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2320.398,2321.798,And then there will be a lapse of time.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2321.798,2323.237,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2323.237,2335.66,"Well, now, why couldn't, after he has filed his application for a writ, why can't he go to the Court and say -- and ask the Court to proceed by written interrogatories?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2354.741,2358.079,Do I understand you to be referring now to 2246 when --
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2358.079,2359.397,That's right.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2359.397,2365.205,"I think that that's a correct interpretation of 2246 insofar as it applies only to evidence, however."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2365.205,2380.813,"Well, whatever it may be, because if the -- if a person in prison should proceed by depo -- by written int -- by, what do you call them?"
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2380.813,2381.32,Interro --
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2381.32,2389.316,"Interrogatories under the federal rules of civil procedure, the interrogatories, presumably, would be available."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2392.122,2393.194,That's correct.
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2393.194,2402.477,And the state can introduce whatever the defendant -- whatever the prisoner does not introduce.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2429.282,2440.506,"No, I don't believe that is correct, Mr. Justice Fortas, because Rule 2246 provides for interrogatories only as a means of cross-examining an affiant of an affidavit."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2464.019,2477.256,"I'm aware of that, but I suppose that if the Court proceeds by affidavit, that he could accept as evidentiary the -- whatever comes in on written interrogatories."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2479.014,2484.287,"Well, that is true but, unfortunately, the affidavit provisions do not permit any discovery."
1968.199,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2491.209,2503.813,"But the chronology in a habeas suit -- curious situation of a habeas case, chronology works out so, as I think you've heard, happily and very well put into us."
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2519.8,2527.077,"Well, certainly not up until -- it's true that procedure differs greatly until an evidentiary hearing is ordered."
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2670.553,2671.05,You may.
1968.199,0,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2671.05,2671.152,Thank you.
1968.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2671.152,2672.839,"You may, Mr. Pottinger."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,2677.398,2680.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2834.709,2838.23,What are the changes in 2241 and 2254?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,2838.23,2856.818,"2241 relates essentially to jurisdiction and provides that when you have a state with more than one federal judicial district, a habeas petition can be entertained either in a district within which the petitioner is confined or the district within which a state criminal conviction and sentence occurred."
1968.199,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.422,2878.69,"And, both those amendments were made in the 1960s."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,2878.69,2882.875,"1966, yes, Your Honor."
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3120.004,3125.616,"Just as a matter of interest, do you now give them a list of witnesses?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3128.469,3129.038,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3134.562,3137.355,It isn't done automatically?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3137.355,3137.415,"No, Your Honor."
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3137.415,3139.122,It isn't done automatically in every case.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3139.122,3144.914,Discovery in criminal practice in California is not a creature of statute.
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3147.663,3148.413,"Oh, yes."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3148.413,3160.626,"It is not recognized by a statute, but the Court appropriately recognized that the provisions, with respect to civil discovery, have no applicability to criminal cases."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3433.523,3441.778,Is there anything in the legislative history that indicates that apart from the language of the statute?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3441.778,3450.019,The legislative history which we encountered with respect to 2246 deals solely with the techniques of taking evidence.
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3522.55,3523.329,Mr. Granberg.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3523.329,3523.53,Yes?
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3523.53,3528.209,Does your brief have any legislative history of 2246?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3528.209,3528.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3528.628,3530.672,"You said that you just put it in 1948, didn't you?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3530.672,3531.56,In 1948.
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3531.56,3544.548,"Can you refer me -- quickly, don't expend your time now with that."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3544.548,3547.549,"Your Honor, that should be found starting at about page 19."
1968.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3547.549,3552.245,Thank you very much.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3552.245,3565.754,"Now, I would submit that this absence of authority to make any showing prior discovery practice in habeas proceedings, prior to 1948 that is, is extremely significant."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3881.942,3930.283,"Your position is that even if a prisoner in a habeas proceeding should make some sort of a case and by affidavit, let us say, and a credible case, then he comes to the judge and asks for -- asks the judge in excise of his inherent power and discretionary power, power in the whole writs or whatnot, to authorize him to serve written interrogatories on named people, that the Court would not have such power."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,3932.626,3948.976,"Well, Wilson versus Weigel does suggest that in a situation in which it would be appropriate to take a deposition for purposes of evidence, that that deposition can be taken by utilizing written interrogatories, cross-interrogatories, and so forth."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3959.466,3966.323,"Well, that's pretty -- those are pretty confusing concepts, unless their particularized."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4014.852,4031.048,"Initially, I'm going to be perfectly clear on this point, that Court would have no power, either within the federal civil rules or apart from the federal civil rules, to authorize written interrogatories for purposes of discovery or to authorize depositions for purposes of discovery."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4031.048,4043.537,"Well, I don't care what you call this, whether -- I don't know whether the case I put to you, you probably call it discovery or evidence, but I put factually the case to you."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4043.537,4043.717,If on a --
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4043.717,4066.479,The prisoner makes out a prima facie case by affidavit and he asks the judge to see to it that the persons res -- plied to written interrogatories so that he could perfect the case which we have made out on a prima facie basis.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4082.287,4087.442,"Let me, if I may, poster the case initially before I answer your question."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4140.859,4143.631,"What's your answer, yes or no?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4143.631,4145.011,"Well, I would answer, no."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4153.035,4170.64,"Then, in the case I put to you, your answer is that the judge, no matter -- even though he's persuaded that the prisoner has made out a prima facie case, the judge does not have the power to provide a procedure by which he may go further?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4170.64,4172.828,"No, but the procedure already exists."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4185.895,4200.381,I suppose -- suppose the prisoner says an evidentiary hearing is the final ultimate objective.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4210.252,4211.086,He's done more than --
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4211.086,4235.499,"I'm trying to say that just as clearly as I can, but I guess I'd better quit because I'm actually questioned as clearly as I can put it, and I'd like to know what your answer is because I want to know what your theory would lead us to in terms of affirmance or denial of the judge's power in that certain -- in that situation?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4235.499,4237.999,"Well, affirmance of the Ninth Circuit opinion would be no more than this."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4250.888,4251.307,I can understand --
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4251.307,4251.621,That I can assume ruled.
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4251.621,4252.863,I understand that.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4282.823,4287.819,"Well, before the judge is determinant, an evidentiary hearing is appropriate."
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4302.817,4303.284,You're telling me to work it --
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4303.284,4304.961,Release from custody had been stated.
1968.199,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4304.961,4307.547,You're telling me to work it out for myself.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4307.547,4309.471,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4329.894,4336.169,"Mr. Granberg, does the habeas corpus procedure a civil right?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4336.169,4337.051,"Oh, yes."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4337.051,4343.058,"And, it's just as much asserted for the truth as any other civil case?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4343.058,4344.2,Certainly.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4344.2,4351.558,"And, therefore, should have all of the necessary procedures to ensure truth."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4354.035,4362.068,"Oh, certainly, to ensure truth, Your Honor, and I would submit that the habeas statute, as it exist now, affords all of the procedures necessary to accord that search for truth."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4362.068,4368.137,"Well, isn't the procedure of written interrogatories another procedure to get closer to the truth?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4368.137,4370.579,"Well, the question you're really asking --"
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4370.579,4373.094,Isn't it?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4373.094,4380.301,It's a technique which is utilized to ascertain facts to clarify issues.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4400.308,4403.829,But you still admit that it would help to get to the truth.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4403.829,4405.896,The question you're really posing is this.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4412.921,4414.917,"That's your question, it's not mine."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4414.917,4421.345,"Which, is appropriately left either to the legislative or certainly to the rule making process --"
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4421.345,4421.622,That's your question.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4421.622,4436.843,"That, I would submit, that it's not a matter appropriate for a Federal District Court to make its own individual determination whether or not a particular rule should be applied because it would be good to have it then."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4436.843,4447.179,"My question is, it's been recognized that, in all other civil actions, this is good but it's not good for habeas corpus?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4447.179,4450.624,That's a policy determination made by the -- originally by the framers of the rule.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4450.624,4453.288,What you say that's what the law is?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4453.288,4455.684,"What I'm suggesting is, any decision that this Court makes --"
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4455.684,4472.551,"You think that it's less important to determine whether a man is in jail for his life unconstitutionally than it is to find out where the man has been overcharged $10,000 in one dissent?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4472.551,4474.525,"No, I don't."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4485.26,4489.712,Your idea is that habeas corpus is an entirely different type of civil action.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4489.712,4490.946,It certainly is.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4490.946,4492.309,Entirely different.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4492.309,4492.987,It certainly is.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4494.732,4495.139,What is this then?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4495.139,4496.929,-- to conventional civil litigation.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4496.929,4499.017,"You have a petitioner, don't you?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4501.064,4502.187,"Yes, we do."
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4502.187,4507.129,"What's the measure of proof, the same?"
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4507.129,4509.224,I've never encountered that question.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4509.224,4509.868,It's a burden of proof.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4509.868,4510.83,I believe it's probably --
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4510.83,4513.098,Isn't the proof the same?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4515.757,4521.027,A conventional civil action is initiated by the file of a complaint.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4521.027,4523.387,"Well, that's the question asserted."
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4523.387,4525.25,By the filing of a complaint.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4572.129,4577.981,That's the same to point to the fact that discovery would help him because his burden is tougher?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4577.981,4579.578,It might very well help them.
1968.199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4579.578,4580.546,Was that what you're arguing?
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4580.546,4605.262,"It might very well help them to have some sort of discovery mechanism available, but the question before this Court now is whether you're going to allow the full discovery mechanism of a federal civil rule to be applied in a habeas proceeding, and I would submit that the framers of the rules never intended that and that the very nature of a habeas proceeding is not appropriate to that sort of discovery mechanism."
1968.199,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4605.262,4608.865,He can always summon the witnesses.
1968.199,1,20933,derald_e_granberg,,4608.865,4610.304,"Certainly, he can."
1968.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4641.814,4648.611,Mr. Feit.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4648.611,4651.969,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4678.2,4688.174,"Let's see, I gather 2255 refers, at least speaks, of the case, doesn't it?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4691.997,4692.298,Yes.
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4692.298,4694.494,The petition -- what's the case?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4706.266,4707.65,Well --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4707.65,4708.689,"Well, isn't it?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4709.596,4710.391,20 --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4710.391,4718.507,"On the face of 2255, it's just another step in the Criminal Clause itself, isn't it?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4718.507,4722.255,"Well, it is on the face of 2255 are the steps in the Criminal Clause itself."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4722.255,4724.322,"But you don't argue that in your brief, do you?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4726.852,4734.008,"Well, what we think 2255 essentially is basically, as this Court has suggested in Hickman --"
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4734.008,4734.735,"Oh, my."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4748.177,4753.499,"This is quite true but, of course, the last 3part of 2255 does suggest that --"
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4753.499,4755.357,"Well, I just -- I'm just surprised."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4766.499,4768.042,"Habeas corpus cases, yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4768.042,4782.382,"And why you don't argue that whatever may be true of federal habeas as a remedy for the state prisoner, clearly enough for the federal prisoner, you're just dealing with another step on the Criminal Clause itself."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4784.778,4805.926,"Well, principally, because we were concerned of the problem of suggesting that a state applicant might get discovery with, as mine or an appellee points out, this is a substantial rather than a procedural rule to say that a ha--a 2255 applicant is an entirely different situation."
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4810.978,4824.212,"Incidentally, that's between the habeas applications of state prisoners in the 2255 applications of federal prisoners, what's the current statistical data?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4825.488,4827.516,I believe the state is still the greater numbered.
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4830.041,4830.524,"Oh, I see."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4830.524,4837.581,I have found some additional figures for the Court with respect to 2255 applications.
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4873.156,4874.434,"Now, that's only 2255."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4874.434,4875.05,"2255, yes."
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4875.05,4877.158,You had comparable statistics for the state --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4877.158,4883.741,I wasn't able to get comparable statistics as to the state material nor was I able to get an actual breakdown.
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4893.215,4905.6,"Well, I take it, the number of filings, let me put it that way, of state prisoners for federal habeas relief must be many times the number of filings of federal prisoners."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4905.6,4906.315,I would --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4906.315,4906.574,Of 2255.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4906.574,4907.571,All the --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4907.571,4908.592,What this would be --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,4908.592,4911.12,Yes.
1968.199,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5060.404,5065.449,Are you getting to the point now where you're going to give counsel in these proceedings?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5069.138,5070.222,"Well, we're in issue --"
1968.199,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5070.222,5075.251,You're making it an extension of the criminal proceeding.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5075.251,5075.323,I think --
1968.199,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5075.323,5075.906,Am I right?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5075.906,5083.844,"I think the statute, though, puts the primary focus on the examination of the files and records."
1968.199,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5149.933,5152.554,My whole point was I didn't think it had to go that far --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5152.554,5152.898,"No, I agree."
1968.199,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5152.898,5154.782,In order to claim your part.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5154.782,5156.224,I agree.
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5602.392,5606.099,"Well, how about this case in respect to the point you're now making?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5608.715,5608.76,I think --
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5608.76,5621.518,"You say that you would submit that there is some kind of inherent power because of the broad discretion generally in this sort of a collateral proceeding, but that that such power should be very sparingly exercised."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5625.736,5639.824,"Well, I think, in this case, as I read the record, the district judge did not exercise any power except the automatic application of the rules."
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5639.824,5640.734,"But, how do we know?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5640.948,5652.517,"Well, to the only extent, the only argument made by the Government in the record, I believe it's in page 3 (a)."
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5690.466,5693.511,"Well, except by the very act of granting the --"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5693.511,5694.005,To that --
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5694.005,5695.769,"-- interrogatories, the Court was exercising discretion."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5695.769,5696.527,"Well, on the assumption that the civil rules --"
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5696.527,5700.484,He says he was fully advised of the premises and he orders the interrogatory.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5700.484,5705.948,But the argument was that the civil rules of discovery do not apply at all.
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5721.764,5723.867,"Well, whatever the district judge --"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5723.867,5723.907,Yes.
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5723.907,5726.856,-- thought he was doing in this case.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5729.454,5736.783,"The answer, I think that this is the kind of case where this can be a very fairly developed hearing as you pointed out, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5744.796,5747.131,"So, it's your submission that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.(Voice Overlap)"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5747.131,5749.305,Appeals that this case should be affirmed.
1968.199,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5749.305,5750.674,That's what I thought.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5750.674,5751.056,Thank you.
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5751.056,5755.227,But why are we limited to that ground or that reason?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5758.667,5759.774,"Now, I don't quite get you, Mr. Justice, I --"
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5759.774,5768.481,"Well, what you are saying is we have the power, the Court had the power, the Court has power, we have the power, inherent power to do it."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5785.638,5788.166,The effect is that it's been held that they couldn't do it.
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5838.003,5840.381,You just asked us to exercise self-restraint.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5846.655,5848.698,"I think that -- that, no --"
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5848.698,5849.089,"Well, I suppose --"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5849.089,5849.942,The --
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5849.942,5852.689,One takes that up if we have the power.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5856.999,5860.765,"Well, as -- I think that the power does exist."
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5891.427,5896.251,"That is about -- I mean, what kind of rules you'll have for taking evidence."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5908.349,5924.037,"No, I -- as you would say, the power exists -- I think the power exists to be used very sparingly in light of the existence of these detailed and specific statute setting forth the procedures."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5924.037,5936.452,You mean -- you mean that there is such a power in addition to whatever it may be the scope of 2246?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5936.452,5937.955,"I would have to say, yes."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5939.575,5950.761,"But I -- but, doesn't the government also argue that, in any event, the extent of any power in the premises is that which is granted by 2246?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5952.047,5966.112,The federal government argues essentially that the statutory scheme set forth in 2255 provides the traditional normal way of dealing with 2255 proceedings.
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5966.766,5968.966,What -- what any bearing of 2246 --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5968.966,5969.128,"Yes, I think--"
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5969.128,5969.831,All on 2255?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,5969.831,5984.415,"I think --I think 2246 further supports the view that there is n -- that there is very narrow use to be made of any power outside of this statutory scheme that that, in effect, 22--"
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5984.415,5990.111,"Well, let's take just a state prisoner then where we're dealing only with 2246."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6002.257,6006.183,"I would have to say that the power, yes, does exist."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6006.183,6008.127,"And that's the inherent power, so-called?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6008.127,6015.188,"Well, I -- I think I would rather talk about it in terms of the equitable power necessary to--"
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6015.188,6017.457,"Well, in any event, whatever it is --"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6017.457,6017.956,Whatever it --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6017.956,6019.842,It doesn't have a statutory source.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6035.465,6036.337,It could be argued.
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6037.217,6037.951,But you don't' argue it?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6037.951,6040.357,And the state has argued it.
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6040.357,6041.055,"The state has, but the federal government doesn't(Voice Overlap)."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6041.055,6043.024,"The state has, but the federal government doesn't argue it."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6043.024,6045.501,"Oh, I think the federal government has a very big stake in this."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6055.116,6055.954,"Yes, it is."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6055.954,6062.892,"And, yet, you don't share with California the view that 2246 is the limit of any power in the premises."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6062.892,6063.889,No.
1968.199,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6063.889,6065.498,"Well, but the fact is that --"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6065.498,6078.915,"But, may I add in response to the question that this is -- we say that the power spelled out in the statute that, essentially, there should be a hearing as provided by statute."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6095.635,6096.959,Beyond anything that's authorized --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6096.959,6097.394,Beyond anything --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6097.394,6097.556,By 2246.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6097.556,6099.619,Anything -- They're beyond anything that's --
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6099.619,6101.088,"That's what I thought you say, yes."
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6101.088,6120.586,"But 2255 doesn't have to prescribe any procedures to the extent that is prescribed for a state habeas, and there's cross-reference to the habeas corpus procedure for some purposes, but not for others."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6144.153,6150.116,"I -- if I can clarify that the -- yes, sir."
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6168.937,6181.381,"Certainly, the limitations on a Federal Court to grant state habeas that are contained in the proc -- in the statutes with respect to habeas corpus petitions are not applicable at all."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6181.381,6181.866,I agree.
1968.199,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6185.96,6187.363,Exactly.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6187.363,6198.074,"Now, perhaps I over spoke, in terms of the government's interest is essentially the 2255, and the -- basically, the 2255."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6198.074,6199.747,"I'm really surprised at that, Mr. Feit."
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6224.171,6236.193,"Yes, and -- but, all I am suggesting is that this is further reason not to utilize any of this additional existing power."
1968.199,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6236.193,6237.289,Yes.
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6237.289,6244.168,"One prisoner should have it, why shouldn't all of them have it?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6244.168,6246.02,"Well, to the extent that the statutes --"
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6246.02,6248.253,What I -- what I don't understand about your argument.
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6268.988,6273.254,I'm suggesting that 2255 spells out certain procedures.
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6297.731,6302.142,"Now, are you saying that none should get it under 2255?"
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6302.142,6310.694,I would think it would have to depend upon the particular case and the particular needs faced by the sentencing judge.
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6312.495,6313.995,It needs faced by the judge or --
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6313.995,6314.225,It needs that the judge (Voice Overlap) --
1968.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6314.225,6315.718,Needs faced by the prisoner?
1968.199,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,6315.718,6322.983,Needs that the judge deems appropriate to resolve the issue of unconstitutional restraint.
1968.199,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6325.061,6327.389,Mr. Pottinger.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6327.389,6337.125,"May I first correct Mr. Feit in his assertion that there is nothing in the record, at least that he has seen, to indicate that the inherent power authority was raised below."
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6686.553,6691.976,"I have a difficulty with, Mr. Pottinger, is this -- why can't you get all that right at the hearing?"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6708.676,6710.105,"Yes, that's correct."
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6710.105,6712.296,Why do you need to get all this in advance of the hearing?
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6714.287,6714.582,Well--
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6714.582,6718.323,Under the provisions of 2246.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6718.323,6729.567,"The -- the short answer to that, Mr. Justice, is that we need the information for all the reasons that civil litigants need discovery to prepare a trial in a civil case."
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6729.567,6738.642,"Well, the issue here, as I understand it, is whether or not there was probable cause for a search of a hotel room across the bay and across San Francisco Bay."
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6738.642,6739.109,That's correct.
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6739.109,6749.483,"Whether or not one Frances somebody or another was a reliable informant, and that issue could be developed right at the hearing, can't it?"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6749.483,6749.919,"No, I don't believe it can."
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6749.919,6750.98,What's the advantage of doing it there?
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6750.98,6766.554,"I -- I don't believe it can for this reason, and it's important to look at the reasons that exist in this case in which were argued to the District Court because Chief Judge Harris asked precisely the question you're asking now and was convinced that interrogatories were essential."
1968.199,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6856.4,6867.264,"Well, I would suggest that you're going to be even more limited in your interrogatories because when you're asking the warden these questions, the honest answer to your questions is “I don't know.”"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6867.264,6886.348,"Well, perhaps I that defect or that technicality is controlling, we will have to resolve it by addressing the interrogatories directly to the state under the theory that the state is the real party in interest and, for that reason, we will nonetheless secure these answers directly from the police officers."
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6900.051,6904.564,When was the rule of discovery authorized in the civil cases?
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6904.564,6905.582,In civil cases?
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6905.582,6906.791,Yes.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6906.791,6913.076,"Well, there was a type of discovery available, as the Court is aware, under Equity Rule 58."
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6913.076,6916.108,"That's right, equity, but I'm talking about civil cases."
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6916.108,6916.571,It --
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6916.571,6920.936,Is the general rule like you have now?
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6920.936,6922.801,I believe in 1938 --
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6922.801,6932.278,"Why you can notify a man in one day to meet you out in here in Mane, to meet you out in California to hear it the next day."
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6934.366,6935.302,If I understand the question --
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6935.302,6937.856,Or three days later.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6937.856,6938.126,If I --
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6938.126,6942.821,"What I'm getting at, that was a serious question of policy, wasn't it?"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6942.821,6943.37,Yes.
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6943.37,6958.831,"I may say that -- I don't mean I share in it, but I've heard more criticism of the dignity, of the suffering of people under that rule of discovery than any other civil rule that's been up to, and it's a question of policy, isn't it?"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6958.831,6961.442,"I -- I believe, in the initial instance, it was."
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6961.731,6963.669,"So, you don't think it is now?"
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6963.669,6967.503,I believe that it -- the policy question has been answered with regard to habeas corpus too(Voice Overlap).
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6967.503,6971.268,"That's why the questions on those had been answered with reference to it, yes."
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6971.268,6973.262,Which includes habeas corpus?
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6973.262,6976.444,"Well, you say then that the rule applies."
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6976.444,6978.092,That's correct.
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6978.092,6980.448,That's your argument that the rule applies.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6980.448,6980.712,We believe that under --
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6980.712,6985.26,We don't have to make up any out of our inherent powers to legislate.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,6985.26,7014.692,"We don't believe so, Mr. Justice Black, but we believe that in the event that the Court is of a different mind that, certainly, inherent power is a second alternative, one that is undisputed and one which flows not only from ex parte Peterson but from the implicit nature, the implications of Townsend against Sain which was to command the Court to inquire into issues of fact and to give the petitioner a full and fair hearing."
1968.199,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7024.481,7026.832,You've made a good argument for him.
1968.199,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,7026.832,7047.906,"I believe -- I believe with regard to the civil rules, however, to answer your question directly, that the policy decision was made in 1938 when Rule 81 (a) (2) was adopted and that that decision did include not only an application of the federal rules to general civil proceedings, but also to habeas corpus."
