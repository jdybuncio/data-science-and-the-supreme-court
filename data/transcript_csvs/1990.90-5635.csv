1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.999,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-5635, John J. McCarthy, Petitioner, versus George Bronson."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,12.429,15.351,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,38.976,40.979,"What was he seeking, Mr. Cerf?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,41.54,44.602,"He sought both damages and injunctive relief, Justice White."
1990.90-5635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.516,76.653,"Mr. Cerf, do we take the case with the agreement of both parties that the defendant waived jury trial here?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,76.653,80.105,"That issue is not before the case... before the Court, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-5635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.105,82.807,So we decide it as though there was a waiver?
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,82.807,83.505,That is correct.
1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.022,188.445,"You can prevent that by demanding a jury trial, can't you?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,188.445,190.025,I... that is correct.
1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.149,214.802,"But in this particular case, if the respondent is right, it worked the way Congress wanted it to."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,222.987,227.221,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I would question that that was how Congress wanted it to work."
1990.90-5635,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,297.466,303.65,"If you can waive a trial and you can waive a jury, why can't you waive this?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,303.65,308.232,"I suppose one can waive it, Justice Marshall, in the following sense."
1990.90-5635,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.588,318.15,"So what do you interpret from that, a waiver?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,318.15,326.145,"That's the... Congress deemed that consent rather than a waiver, but in effect it has the same... it has same consequences."
1990.90-5635,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,326.145,329.207,What's so sacred about this that you can't waive it?
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,329.207,331.929,I'm not suggesting that the right can't be waived.
1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.523,357.694,There's a certain incongruity it seems to me in... in your interpretation.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,377.489,381.6,"Respondents make the... very much the same argument, as did the court below."
1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.052,419.994,"Well, it's not so much the seriousness of the event, but the amount of discretion that's called for."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,440.899,445.964,I think in fact the incongruity implicit in the question is somewhat overstated.
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.076,483.508,"Mr. Cerf, can I interrupt a minute?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,529.978,543.477,"--I would say quite frankly, Justice Scalia, that that is the most difficult category of cases to get... to categorize, wherein you have what I suppose could be described as a past conditions case under any sort of conventional understanding of the phrase--"
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.477,545.658,"Well, why do you say it's a past conditions case?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,549.151,561.977,"--Well, I'm saying that as you posited the hypothetical, Justice Scalia, there was a condition of confinement in the conventional sense of the word in that for a period of time one was exposed to an unconstitutional circumstance."
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.036,614.484,"Gee, but if clean lines is the criterion, I think... I think you lose, because that's the main argument that the other side has going for it... that it's a lot of trouble to draw any of these lines between ongoing and non-ongoing and so forth."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,614.484,615.586,I don't--
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.586,620.288,You can say that any complaint about how you're treating... treated in prison relates to a condition of your confinement.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,621.52,623.17,"--It may be a clean line, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-5635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.679,653.33,"Well, but, Mr. Cerf, in the case of Preiser v. Rodriguez, this Court talked about the term ""conditions of confinement"" and gave some examples there that looked very much like this kind of case, and said that was a matter of a condition of confinement."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,678.757,682.52,"Let me try to address both of those points, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-5635,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.795,759.228,"Suppose the prisoner alleges that if the officials will not... are not enjoined, it is likely the conduct will be repeated."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,762.781,764.483,"I think it does, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-5635,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.453,770.437,But don't you almost always have to allege that if you're going to ask for an injunction?
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,770.437,776.86,"--Well, that's correct, and I think that, again, the issue is not what is alleged in the complaint, because the decision is not made at that point."
1990.90-5635,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,800.696,811.334,"I suppose this is a... quite a routine and frequent allegation in order to support the claim for injunctive relief, is it not?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,811.334,814.206,It is a routine allegation.
1990.90-5635,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.373,826.863,And I... and I assume you have to make some such allegation if you're going to ask for injunctive relief.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,826.863,828.376,--You would need to indeed.
1990.90-5635,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,900.233,913.91,"Well, isn't there one further wrinkle to it, and that is as long as the damage action was kept alive, there could never be a reference in what I would imagine was the run-of-the-mill case in which there's a request for damages as well as an injunction."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,919.003,919.764,Well--
1990.90-5635,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.764,933.242,"So as a practical matter, it seems to me what you're saying is except in the unusual case in which there is not request for damages based on the past incidents of the practice in question, there never can be a reference."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,933.242,935.635,"--I... that... that's not our position, Justice Souter."
1990.90-5635,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.635,937.717,But why doesn't it follow from your position?
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,954.936,959.471,"I think that would not be the consequence, and if I... if I might try to explain that."
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.996,1034.499,"Excuse me, I... it doesn't seem to me you've answered Justice Souter's concern."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1061.147,1062.088,"Well, the good of it--"
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.088,1066.85,"So, in every case where there... where there's a damage claim, you may as well not have the provision."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1066.85,1068.683,"--I... again, I... let me be clear."
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.858,1080.1,"Oh, well, why is that?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1080.1,1086.084,I think that in a sense you have a result that's driven by the statutory language.
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.077,1126.589,I didn't understand that to be your position.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1128.37,1131.191,"--That's the position we took in our reply brief, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.275,1245.628,"--Mr. Cerf, can I... can I ask you a couple more questions about your line?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1245.628,1245.939,--Sure.
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.939,1264.96,"I know this was raised in Justice Scalia's question so... the specific cases referred to in Preiser, do you say each of them, except arguably Haines, was a case that would meet the conditions of confinement definition: the deprival of legal materials for the particular petition, the inability to... with the one religious objection in the other case?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1264.96,1266.302,"Yes, I do."
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.372,1293.637,"And your line is that if he'd complained of having been deprived of it 6 months ago, but then he eventually got it, it would not longer be a conditions of confinement claim?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1293.637,1303.375,"--That is my claim, unless, of course... and this is a judgment that would need to be made in any case... unless of course he had satisfied the City of Los Angeles v. Lyons test of indicating some real and immediate threat that he would--"
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.375,1303.655,Yes.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1303.655,1306.166,--again be exposed to that unconstitutional conduct.
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.166,1314.011,"And conversely, in the case before us, if the prison had a rule that said when prisoners refuse to cell, it's appropriate to use tear gas to get them out of their cells."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1315.303,1319.497,"If there's a rule that's saying when a prisoner refuses to leave the cell, then it's appropriate?"
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.615,1335.285,"Well, it had been applied, as it has here."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1342.521,1344.251,"--It probably would in this sense, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.251,1379.444,"Well, isn't... isn't the... isn't the prisoner the master of his own complaint?"
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1401.019,1401.55,No.
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.55,1403.98,--of confinement case by virtue of the mere existence of the regulation?
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1403.98,1404.982,Not at all.
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.53,1406.041,Okay.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1406.041,1412.315,What I am suggesting is one needs to take in... take into account what is being challenged and the nature of the relief and the nature of the claim.
1990.90-5635,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.217,1413.878,So it's up to him.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1424.504,1427.016,"--Well, to a degree that true of any litigant I would think, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.563,1440.276,"Well, but Mr.... let me go a step further."
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1460.367,1464.791,--I suspect that would be... if I understand the hypothetical... that would be a conditions case.
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.396,1476.229,But he doesn't really care about he rule.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1478.21,1480.511,"Well, if he's... if he's... let me be absolutely clear."
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.652,1482.511,Yes.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1482.511,1491.088,"--he said for 4 days I had... I had a toothache and I suffered terrible pain and I want compensation for that, and that's all he asking for, no, I don't think that is a conditions case."
1990.90-5635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.088,1496.231,Even though the defense is the reason he didn't get it is because we have this standard regulation that this is the way we treat all prisoners.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1498.412,1499.992,"That's... that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-5635,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.763,1502.576,Your rule then is simply a rule of pleading.
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1514.074,1516.785,"--Well, I don't suggest that it's only a matter of pleading, Justice Souter."
1990.90-5635,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.08,1524.068,But if that's what--
1990.90-5635,0,18618,christopher_d_cerf,,1536.377,1537.889,It may become that.
1990.90-5635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.196,1569.869,"Yes, you may, Mr. Cerf."
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1572.23,1577.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.878,1638.645,You say the Seventh Amendment right would be protected I suppose just by the prisoner demanding a jury trial in a damages case?
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1638.645,1640.245,Like... like every litigant--
1990.90-5635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.245,1640.736,Is that right?
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1640.736,1642.038,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1990.90-5635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.782,1651.172,And so there would be no reference?
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1651.172,1655.727,"If there were a jury trial demand, timely made, there would be no reference."
1990.90-5635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.727,1662.531,And to that extent the language of the act would just be beside the point.
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1662.531,1666.062,"It would not be beside the point, with all due respect, Justice White."
1990.90-5635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.836,1680.621,"Well, in those... in the damages case where there's a demand for jury trial, the aim of Congress just wouldn't be effective then?"
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1680.621,1692.449,"--Well, I think we have to assume that Congress knew that... and the cases are pretty clear on this... that pursuant to (b)(1)(B), there cannot be a reference for a jury trial by the magistrate."
1990.90-5635,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.187,1800.39,"But I guess the other side would say, General, that this plaintiff didn't care about those conditions."
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1816.56,1820.404,--The petitioner in this case very much cared about the prison directives.
1990.90-5635,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.771,1897.504,"General Blumenthal, if... taking the Preiser dichotomy for a moment... if a plaintiff has a habeas claim, wanting to shorten his time in jail... get out of jail, that is referable to a magistrate by a separate provision of the act?"
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1897.504,1905.548,It is referable under that provision of the act that is provided for in (b)(1)(B).
1990.90-5635,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.015,1928.015,"So under... under your interpretation both sides of the Preiser against Rodriguez types of complaints are referable to magistrates, albeit by two different provisions?"
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1928.015,1930.546,"Yes, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.377,1983.21,"But on the other hand, is there anything in the legislative history that mentions Preiser?"
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1983.21,1986.572,"There is nothing, Justice Stevens, that--"
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.572,1989.624,"Really the legislative history is kind of a draw I guess, isn't it?"
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1989.624,1995.09,"--Well, in all honesty, the legislative history is pretty much silent on this--"
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.09,1995.3,Yes.
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1995.3,1995.778,--subject.
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.781,2015.222,Maximum but really not unlimited either.
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2051.697,2053.156,And that clearly--
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.156,2054.828,Which is kind of anomalous.
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2054.828,2063.973,"--Well, I don't know that I would agree that it's anomalous, because I think that it was the intent of Congress that there be certain nonconsensual references."
1990.90-5635,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.973,2064.293,Right.
1990.90-5635,1,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2064.293,2076.853,"And that where there is no objection... no timely demand for a jury, it's perfectly proper under (b)(1)(B) for there to be a reference to a magistrate by the district judge."
