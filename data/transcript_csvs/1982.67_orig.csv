1982.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.988,"We will hear first this morning Number 67 Original, Idaho against Oregon."
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,14.162,15.641,"Thanks, Your Honor."
1982.67_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.751,294.595,What kind of a formula is used to protect the Indian rights?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,294.595,305.792,"In the Sorhappy case, the Federal District Court said that the Indians were to get 50 percent of the harvestable surplus."
1982.67_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.627,332.501,Is it in the nature of an escapement number?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,332.501,335.671,It is after the escapement is met.
1982.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.555,360.438,What is the formula that you think will protect Idaho's interests?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,360.438,379.319,"--The formula that we have laid out is essentially at Pages 81 and 82 of our brief, and we are saying that you go one step beyond the five-year plan, and that you take the 60 percent of the non-treaty fishery and slice off an allocation for Idaho."
1982.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,380.951,383.843,An allocation not yet determined?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,383.843,385.172,--Not yet determined.
1982.67_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.55,413.502,But didn't the Master say you could not tell how many Idaho had contributed?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,413.502,430.683,"The Master indicated that, but the unrebutted testimony by Idaho's experts was that you could determine it, and that unrebutted testimony was based on formulas that the defendants have devised."
1982.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.019,444.233,"Well, General Jones, you are not suggesting the Master isn't entitled to disbelieve testimony even though it is unrebutted, are you?"
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,444.233,458.922,"Well, we are saying that if it is not inherently incredible, if it is not contradicted, if people don't punch holes on it, if it is not inherently incredible, he has to live with it, we think."
1982.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.922,480.966,"What if the Master concluded that it is simply an unknowable factor, and therefore it wouldn't be a matter of impugning the credibility or integrity of the witness, but simply a conclusion that the witness was in outer space in terms of giving an opinion?"
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,480.966,509.816,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that he did not say it was unknowable, and possibly it could be, but historically the runs have been 50 percent contributed by Idaho, and that is recognized by the experts for Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and fish counts are kept, so that you can find out certainly a year afterwards what the run was, and what--"
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.816,513.59,Aren't you including in Idaho's contribution the hatchery fish?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,513.59,517.17,--We include hatchery fish in all the calculations.
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.17,517.941,Why do you assign those hatcheries to Idaho?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,517.941,518.542,Pardon?
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.542,521.714,Why do you assign those hatcheries to Idaho as a state?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,521.714,556.987,"Well, because this Court, I believe, recognized in the Washington fishing vessel case... I believe it was that case... that hatcheries are there primarily to compensate for damages caused by the dams, and the principle has been recognized with respect to the Indians, and it should be recognized with respect to us, and those hatcheries are apportioned, like under the Lower Snake Compensation Plan, those hatcheries are apportioned to compensate, they are distributed to compensate for the damages that were caused by the dams."
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.371,563.8,"You didn't put all the hatcheries there, either."
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,563.8,564.582,But--
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.582,565.703,Did you?
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,565.703,569.975,--It is just like the fellow that goes out and gets mowed down on the street.
1982.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.727,574.888,"Well, I just asked you, did you put all the hatcheries in?"
1982.67_orig,0,31097,jim_jones,,574.888,575.509,"--No, but--"
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1622.435,1637.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the starting position that the state of Idaho takes is to assert that the Master in some way restricted the record they had an opportunity to make."
1982.67_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1791.146,1798.068,"Mr. Mackie, do you concede that Idaho is entitled under some theory to an equitable share of the fish?"
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1798.068,1813.95,"Your Honor, our position on that is that Idaho's claim is novel, it is unique, it has no precedent in terms... in any case law nor any that they could develop for having ""a right"" here at all."
1982.67_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.738,1832.991,"Well, do you concede that Idaho has an equitable right to some share of the fish?"
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1832.991,1844.541,--In terms... I believe that Idaho could present in an appropriate circumstance a need to have some protection which would give rise--
1982.67_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.541,1850.693,"Well, just in the abstract, does Idaho have an equitable right to a share of anadromous fish?"
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1850.693,1862.924,"--Your Honor, in the abstract, my response is that the right comes into being because of the need to create it, and therefore if in fact they have demonstrated the need, that gives rise to the equitable right."
1982.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.345,1886.186,"Well, as I read your brief, I thought you were saying that fish just weren't a subject for equitable apportionment, and that the Master was just wrong in saying that Idaho was... did have an equitable right, and if it could prove it up, it would get relief."
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1887.618,1897.646,"--Your Honor, what our position was is that Idaho having failed to prove need for any protection, it is not appropriate therefore to label that they have a right at the outset."
1982.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.444,1911.033,"You don't think our prior opinion precluded the Master... would have precluded the Master from, after hearing the evidence, saying there is not a right to equitable apportionment?"
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1911.033,1912.174,--Yes.
1982.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.043,1915.635,The case is justiciable.
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1924.721,1938.883,"--Your Honor, the Master addressing that point found that it was inappropriate to dismiss the action without having it proceed to the merits to determine whether there might be a right that would give rise."
1982.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.883,1939.902,Do you disagree with that--
1982.67_orig,1,22839,edward_b_mackie,,1939.902,1940.673,And that is what this Court affirmed.
1982.67_orig,2,31097,jim_jones,,3408.416,3409.688,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.67_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.688,3412.259,You were going to respond with some figures for us.
1982.67_orig,2,31097,jim_jones,,3412.259,3414.489,Yes.
1982.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.549,3429.069,Supplemental brief filed where?
1982.67_orig,2,31097,jim_jones,,3429.069,3429.98,--With the Master.
1982.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.98,3431.012,Is that here?
1982.67_orig,2,31097,jim_jones,,3431.012,3433.072,It should be in the record.
