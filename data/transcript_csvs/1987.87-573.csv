1987.87-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.825,"Mr. Kneedler, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,19.825,26.288,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-573,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.475,188.327,Mr. Kneedler.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,188.327,188.787,--Yes.
1987.87-573,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.787,190.757,What is the standard on appellate review?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,193.109,201.106,"That is the standard the courts have applied, and we don't dispute that as the legal test."
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.847,262.546,You don't bring to us the question whether or not the clock should have been restarted for the full 70 days?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,262.546,263.127,We do not.
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,265.348,267.099,You did argue it below?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,267.099,268.79,We did argue that in the Court of Appeals.
1987.87-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.163,365.594,Mr. Kneedler.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,365.594,366.044,--Yes.
1987.87-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.044,372.689,What section of the criminal rules is it that speaks of dismissal of indictments with prejudice or without prejudice?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,372.689,401.377,"Well, Rule 48 prior to the passage of the Speedy Trial Act, Rule 48 of the criminal rules provided for dismissal of cases basically for want of prosecution, and then that was... then when the Speedy Trial Clause of the Constitution was given particular force in Barker v. Wingo, that and the Speedy Trial Act have to some extend Rule 48 and importance, but it would be Rule 48."
1987.87-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.377,412.563,"Well, for instance, supposingly we were dealing with a violation of other than the Speedy Trial Act, would a district court have authority to dismiss an indictment with prejudice?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,412.563,413.635,Ordinarily not.
1987.87-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.794,430.054,But here the Speedy Trial Act itself authorizes dismissal with prejudice.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,430.054,430.505,--That's correct.
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.394,498.501,"Mr. Kneedler, in deciding whether there was an abusive discretion in dismissing with prejudice rather than without prejudice, do you think it's proper for us to take into account that there was a subsisting charge which was not dismissed and for which the judge imposed the maximum penalty, which he might not have done had the other count not been dismissed?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,498.501,501.543,"Well, I don't think it's--"
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.543,504.174,"He got five years for what, what was the other offense?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,504.705,506.476,--For the failure to appear.
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.476,507.848,"For not showing up a trial, right; failure to appear."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,507.848,511.56,We don't think that should play a substantial role here.
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.401,567.626,"Mr. Kneedler, the statute was passed in order to get prompt prosecutions, right?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,567.626,568.137,Yes.
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.137,573.601,And one way to do that is to prod the prosecutor.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,584.056,586.287,"Well, first of all, we're not saying--"
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.287,590.781,"If the only thing that will be done is to say, oops, you shouldn't have done that."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,590.781,598.154,"--Well, first of all, we are not saying that this Court should say that a court can never... the district court can never dismiss with prejudice."
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,609.963,610.854,And write that out.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,610.854,621.5,"Well, and the court should at least focus on that question and dismiss only when there has been a serious violation of the statutory standards."
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,621.5,622.221,Do you want that in writing?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,622.221,622.892,Pardon me?
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.892,625.263,Do you want that in writing?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,625.263,627.266,From this Court?
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.315,629.798,"No, from the trial court."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,629.798,630.388,--Yes.
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.678,632.8,Is that what you are insisting on?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,632.8,637.411,"--Well, the court... it's not possible, and I think this case is a good example of that."
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,649.64,652.561,Did the government ask him for that?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,652.561,657.025,I don't know that the government went back and asked for more.
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.57,699.392,"Frankly, what worries me is if we are going to have to take every one of these cases."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,699.392,701.752,"No, what we would hope is--"
1987.87-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,701.752,703.064,I would hope not.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,703.064,708.478,--And we would hope not to have to present the Court with an occasion in the future.
1987.87-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.56,775.581,Do you think the district court disregarded that principle?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,775.581,776.893,"Yes, we do, because in the--"
1987.87-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.893,778.172,But not the first.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,778.172,782.647,--The district court conceded that this was a serious violation of the act.
1987.87-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.647,787.058,"Yes, but your first principle, consider all of the circumstances."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,787.058,806.521,"We think the district court violated that too, because under the second and third factors in this case, the district court, as I said, only focused on what it termed the lackadaisical attitude of the marshall service which we think is in fact a considerably overdrawn view, but it did not consider the other circumstances under the second and third factor."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.521,815.298,"Mr. Kneedler, are you saying that we should send the case back and ask him to reconsider all the facts and write a more elaborate opinion before he comes to the conclusion, or are we to decide that the--"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,815.298,818.771,"No, I think this Court can properly reverse outright, and that's--"
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.771,828.546,"--We can weigh those facts and say it's perfectly clear that the five-year sentence shouldn't have been taken into consideration and all the rest of it, and evaluate this history of events and say--"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,828.546,835.361,"--On your first point, the district court did not rely on the five-year sentence."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.361,835.931,"--Well, maybe he did and maybe he didn't."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,850.07,852.711,"That I don't know, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.711,857.975,"But say he did in fact take that in, you say that would be impermissible for him to take--"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,857.975,859.907,"No, I didn't say it was impermissible."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.988,878.728,"--Well, if he writes an opinion and he says, if he had pleaded guilty to the narcotics offense, I think I would have given him five years based on guidelines or other considerations, and I think I can give this man adequate punishment by giving him five years for the flight, and I also can clean up a problem in the marshall's office if I enter this remedy."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,881.63,890.206,"--Yes, I think that would be, because again the escape was a separate offense, separately provided for by Congress, and--"
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.206,898.442,"But in some of your filings I think you rely on the escape as something that justifies on the other side of the coin, don't you?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,898.442,906.097,"--Well, but it does factor in directly to the second and third parts of the balance of test."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.097,907.95,Even though he got adequately punished for it.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,907.95,915.494,"Well, but it also goes directly... yes, yes, definitely, because it goes directly to, for example, the facts and circumstances of this case."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.622,935.225,But does that go to the question of whether there was a violation of the clock?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,935.225,947.413,"No, they also go, in our view, to the question of whether the indictment should be dismissed with prejudice, because one of the factors is the facts and circumstances of the case leading to dismissal."
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.111,962.774,"In any event, the real thrust of your argument is not that he should take another look at all the facts that you describe."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,967.516,967.907,Yes.
1987.87-573,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.907,970.959,--as a matter of law in this case it had to be without prejudice.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,970.959,973.61,"Right, and there are two reasons why I think that would be proper."
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.337,1020.43,"Mr. Kneedler, suppose I agree with you on that that it is beyond the bounds of discretion, and suppose I also agree with you that it would have been improper for the court to make up for one mistake by making a second mistake, giving too high a sentence on the flight charge, where does that leave me?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1041.226,1043.256,"There are two responses to that, at least."
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.98,1049.32,"We don't know it wasn't either, though."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1049.32,1050.252,"--No, that's true."
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.416,1074.748,Do we know it will be the same judge?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1079.1,1086.355,"No, the escape and substantive offenses were both... were both in the Western District of Washington."
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.384,1105.427,"Mr. Kneedler, when the trial judge considered this matter, did she take testimony for the marshall service?"
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1105.427,1110.91,"No, the finding was based on affidavits."
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.154,1199.368,"Well, the judge was obviously disturbed about something the government said or did in order to make the finding that the government had a lackadaisical attitude."
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1199.368,1205.194,"Well, all the district court said was that, and in fact that is--"
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1205.194,1208.163,But there is no evidence in the record to support that; is that your position?
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1208.163,1218.111,"--Well, all the... no, all the district court relied on was the sequence of events in California before Respondent was returned to Washington State."
1987.87-573,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.111,1219.693,There was an affidavit from DEA.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1222.445,1225.096,"On this point, no."
1987.87-573,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.124,1255.434,I thought it was in the record that the reason for the delay in sending him back up to Washington was the marshall was waiting to get together a bunch of prisoners so that the cost of transporting them would be less.
1987.87-573,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1255.434,1256.376,"Right, that appears--"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1684.065,1690.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the members of the Court:"
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.48,1796.641,"Mr. Loveseth, do you think that the trial court though has a duty to consider any prejudice to the defendant in making a decision whether to dismiss with prejudice to the state?"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1796.641,1799.283,I think it is permissible for the trial court to consider prejudice.
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.883,1804.175,Do you think the trial court should be required to consider them?
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1804.175,1811.999,"Not when she finds that the... I don't think she would be required to consider it, or give it as much weight, particularly in a situation whereas here."
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.971,1831.845,"Well, in this case, I gather the Defendant would have to remain in jail in any event because of the new charge of leaving before the trial and so forth?"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1831.845,1839.669,"Well, I would like to think maybe I could get him bail, but I would agree that it would substantially increase, and I think in all probability he would have stayed in."
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.84,1879.354,"Well, I guess none of this would have happened if he hadn't fled the scene in the first place, would it?"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1879.354,1890.622,"Well, I think that may be true, except that Congress intended that a person who flees would not restart the clock, and that that would be taken care of by excluding the time."
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1907.865,1913.946,"Well, except he wouldn't have to be returned from California had he not left Washington."
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1913.946,1915.438,"Well, I mean I will just say this."
1987.87-573,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.954,1930.208,"Well, surely you don't suggest that his deliberate flight is an irrelevant circumstance to a--"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1930.208,1930.989,"--No, not at all."
1987.87-573,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.989,1931.57,--All right.
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,1931.57,1935.091,I don't think it's... it didn't lead to the dismissal.
1987.87-573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.133,2007.399,"That really is imputing an extraordinary amount of discretion to the district court to say that sort of shifting back and forth is permissible, it seems to me."
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2007.399,2020.098,"Well, I think that one of the aims of this Speedy Trial Act was to give the court a lot of discretion to deal with the act and its application in their district."
1987.87-573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.685,2058.851,"You say there was a systemic problem, but you say that was what Congress... you are not saying that Judge Rothstein thought there was a systemic problem in the marshall service here."
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2063.055,2074.582,"Well, she felt that... she felt that the marshall was going to do what it normally did, and that is wait until prisoners get... wait until they get a substantial number of prisons and then move them along."
1987.87-573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.932,2091.723,"Well, it gives them 10 days, and then it creates a rebuttable presumption after that."
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2095.617,2103.782,"I understand that, but the government had an opportunity to rebut that presumption, had an opportunity to come in and talk about the marshall's problems, and they didn't do it."
1987.87-573,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.757,2138.934,"Well, Mr. Loveseth, it is, after all, somewhat of a burden for the state if the case is dismissed without prejudice."
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2151.333,2157.676,I would agree that it is a burden on the state to proceed again.
1987.87-573,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2199.614,2216.035,"In future cases when you represent the defendant in sentencing, will you concede the fact that... that the fact and circumstance that an indictment has been dismissed without prejudice should be considered adversely to your client on the remaining charges?"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2216.035,2219.477,I argued that at the time of the sentencing for Mr. Taylor.
1987.87-573,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2373.568,2379.532,"Mr. Loveseth, do you know where your client is now?"
1987.87-573,1,28608,ian_g_loveseth,,2379.532,2382.824,"The client is in a halfway house in San Francisco, Your Honor."
1987.87-573,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2382.824,2384.196,So you do know where he is.
