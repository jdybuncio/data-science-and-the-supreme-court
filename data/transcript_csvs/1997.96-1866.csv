1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.249,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1866, Alida Star Gebser and Alida Jean McCullough v. the Lago Vista Independent School District."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,58.5,61.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.028,89.95,Was there some showing that it was discriminatory?
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,101.348,111.604,"We're using in the briefs and in the documents in the case that are in the joint appendix, we're using the term, sexual harassment, as synonymous with discrimination, and I believe the Franklin court--"
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.604,113.444,"Well, I think in Oncale we said it wasn't."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,113.444,114.386,--Well--
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.386,125.172,"That you have to show that the treatment... not only that the treatment was harassing, but that it was... you were treating one sex on a basis that you would not have treated the other sex."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,125.172,139.432,"--And I think that's amply shown by the record in this case and I think that the Franklin case simply stands for the proposition that when a teacher intentionally harasses a student, that is discrimination based on sex."
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.432,142.884,"Well, the Franklin case said there's a private cause of action."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,142.884,143.395,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.395,154.682,But are you saying that it would be enough if you showed there was just harassment of a student by a teacher of a different sex?
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,154.682,156.883,"If the harassment was based on sex, yes."
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.883,164.289,"Well, I think the statute says you have to discriminate on the basis of sex."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,169.372,171.373,And in this case that's exactly what happened.
1997.96-1866,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.645,176.127,Because of her sex?
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,176.127,177.247,Because of her sex.
1997.96-1866,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.369,210.889,"Well, you know, I think the tough question we need to answer here is whether a suit under Title IX, which this is, I think--"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,210.889,211.439,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1866,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.439,237.255,"--should be governed by the principles of Title VII suits, or whether there is some different standard here under Title IX because essentially it's a Federal financial grant program under Title IX, and it's quite possible that agency principles don't apply to Title IX at all."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,239.847,240.708,I'll do it right now.
1997.96-1866,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,294.865,297.928,"But, what about the supposed constitutional distinction between them?"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,331.418,341.566,"The respondent, with all respect, I think overreads the Spending Clause and overreads the cases that construe the Spending Clause."
1997.96-1866,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.344,385.514,"Well, are you saying that there were regulations at the time in question here that indicated that the standard of employer liability for employee conduct would be something different from actual knowledge?"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,385.514,386.415,That would be my--
1997.96-1866,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.415,386.914,What did they say?
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,386.914,409.199,"--my disagreement with the implication of your question, Justice Souter, and that is that I do not believe that the Pennhurst case or any of the Spending Clause cases require any extensive catalogue of what facts or what fact patterns might trigger liability, any more than the Spending Clause requires an exhaustive listing of the potential remedies that might follow if there is a violation."
1997.96-1866,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.199,419.906,"Do you draw any distinction between the significance of the Spending Clause for primary liability... i.e., the liability of the employee, or the conduct--"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,419.906,420.216,Yes.
1997.96-1866,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.216,432.355,"--which could give rise to liability and, on the other hand, the significance of the Spending Clause argument for determinations of imputed or vicarious liability?"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,436.175,442.009,"I think... to the extent that there are differences, I think they get resolved the same way."
1997.96-1866,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.053,461.794,So... and do you--
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,473.952,474.453,"--Yes, sir."
1997.96-1866,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.453,486.08,"If we really believe strongly in the principle that Spending Clause impositions upon the States must be clearly expressed, there wouldn't be a cause of action here at all, right?"
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,486.08,495.427,"If I may, Justice Scalia, I'll invoke your concurring opinion in the Franklin case and simply observe that a couple of bridges have been crossed."
1997.96-1866,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.427,515.169,"No, but I'm saying, it's... we're sort of switching the music if, having created the cause of action in the face of its nonexpression, despite the fact that this is a spending thing, we suddenly... we get very picky, I suppose, about what the content of that cause of action is."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,515.169,516.53,"Well, I--"
1997.96-1866,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.53,522.876,"Of course, Cannon was decided long before we adopted this rule about Spending Clause certainties."
1997.96-1866,0,43481,terry_l_weldon,,522.876,531.341,"--I understand that, but I'd like to point out, as you pointed out in that same concurring opinion, that Congress then took subsequent action--"
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1236.891,1247.229,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.147,1298.874,"Why shouldn't we require that the district, in order to be liable, have a policy that permits discrimination, that affirmatively permits it?"
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1325.779,1327.221,"Well, Your Honor, the--"
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.221,1338.398,"In other words, why shouldn't we apply the same kind of a test we apply in 1983 cases, that there has to be a policy of the school as far as private liability is concerned, a policy of discriminating?"
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1338.398,1344.983,"--Your Honor, the differences between Title IX and section 1983 demonstrate that that would not be an appropriate application."
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.885,1384.499,"Right, and I think it's reasonable to read that to mean, you know, in accordance with the policies of that program."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1384.499,1385.03,Well--
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.03,1391.563,"You're being discriminated against under the program if the program, by policy, does not treat you equally."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1391.563,1405.471,"--But Your Honor, a recipient... this school district, just like any other entity that... can only act through human agents, and any discrimination under its program activities is going to be carried out by its human agents, and there is no reason to deviate."
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.471,1408.053,The same argument was made in 1983 and somehow we've stumbled through.
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1408.053,1414.126,"But Your Honor, in addition to the text of section 1983, which is remarkably different from Title IX, there is also the history, and what led this Court--"
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.126,1420.08,I'm unsympathetic to your arguments based on the text of Title IX inasmuch as Title IX doesn't even create a cause of action at all.
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1420.08,1438.413,"--Well, Your Honor, as my colleague mentioned we've crossed that bridge and, in fact, acts by Congress since then have reinforced the breadth of Title IX and, as you... your concurrence in Franklin pointed out, Congress enacted a statute to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there specifically refers to legal remedies."
1997.96-1866,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.413,1443.018,"And I accept all that, but we're not in an area where we're bound very tightly to the text."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1443.018,1444.587,"Your Honor, I think the other--"
1997.96-1866,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.587,1449.981,"May I just ask you this question, and of course, in Cannon we held that Congress implicitly did intend a remedy."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1466.974,1468.643,"--No, Your Honor, we don't believe so."
1997.96-1866,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.435,1473.997,So you're arguing that on these facts the funds could be revoked for this school district?
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1473.997,1496.091,"--Yes, but I have to qualify that there is a statutory requirement placed on the Department of Education to make preliminary steps of voluntary conciliation because of the extreme nature of cutting off funds, and what the Court has recognized is that a private damage remedy stops short of that and also serves another function of Title IX, and that's its remedial purpose."
1997.96-1866,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.778,1537.859,"Well, Ms. Brinkmann, I'm not sure we get to that question at all."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1564.705,1565.236,--Your Honor--
1997.96-1866,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.236,1567.128,It certainly isn't clear under Title VII.
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1577.523,1583.988,"--Your Honor, the concern underlying the Court's opinions about Spending Clause statutes is notice to a recipient."
1997.96-1866,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1590.033,1596.357,"Well, in programs and activities of the school."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1617.371,1618.32,"--Your Honor, we would--"
1997.96-1866,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.32,1619.802,"--who's a female, or something like that."
1997.96-1866,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1619.802,1626.207,"--We urge, though, that actually the focus on the text of Title IX is broader than Title VII's antidiscrimination prohibition."
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,1841.14,1848.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1866,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.0,1912.047,"Now, he used his position as a teacher, and it was a course in which she was one of the only or very few students, and some of this... the initial encounters, of course, occurred on the campus."
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,1912.047,1918.241,"Well, certainly their first introduction was in the context of the school setting, but that's all you have."
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.08,2039.192,Do you think the Government could have withheld funds in the future for the--
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2039.192,2039.533,Yes.
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.533,2041.162,--You think they could have?
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2041.162,2041.643,Yes.
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.643,2046.386,Therefore you are acknowledging the school district violated the statute and the regulation?
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2046.386,2051.21,"I don't think they could legitimately, but under their argument... under their argument this is a violation of Title IX."
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.21,2052.222,"Oh, no, I mean under your view of the law."
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2052.222,2052.28,"Oh, no."
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.851,2063.786,Do you think there's a difference in standards between an attempt by the Government to withhold... revoke your funding on the one hand and a private damage action on the other?
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2063.786,2065.71,No.
1997.96-1866,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2069.393,2078.297,Do you know practically how often the cut off of funding has been used as distinguished from lesser remedies?
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2078.297,2085.271,"--Justice Ginsburg, there is no evidence of that in the record, and I do not know personally what those statistics would hold."
1997.96-1866,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.271,2090.434,Because that's a rather severe sanction.
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2090.434,2091.235,"Yes, it is."
1997.96-1866,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2091.235,2094.888,And defeats the whole purpose of the funds.
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2094.888,2099.25,"Indeed it does, and that leads to another point of the Spending Clause legislation."
1997.96-1866,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.876,2140.647,"Lago Vista is in Travis County, near Austin?"
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2140.647,2141.819,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1866,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.169,2161.162,How much in Federal funds did you receive?
1997.96-1866,2,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,2161.162,2176.163,"It was about, approximately 120,000, $120,000 back in the 1992-'93 school year, and that's in that... the... you can find it in the Texas Education Agency's snap book, snapshot that's in the National Association's brief, and--"
