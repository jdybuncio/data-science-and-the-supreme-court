1987.86-422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,72.346,"Mr. Buchwald, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,72.346,79.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.567,213.119,"Mr. Buchwald, can I ask you a question right there?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,238.92,240.853,"There would not, Your Honor."
1987.86-422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,240.853,245.574,In that you could reasonably conclude that there was some injury to market participants as a result of this?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,245.574,253.43,"We would submit that that would not suffice, that there must be fraud upon the market participants."
1987.86-422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.875,312.099,"But in the short answer, you are saying that, taking these facts, even if they had alleged and proved adverse market impact as a result of the fraud, that would still not be a violation because... because what?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,312.099,320.955,"Because a market participant must be defrauded in that capacity as a market participant, and that that is the reach of the securities laws."
1987.86-422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.741,361.132,But why is this any less of a fraud on the market participants than if the information that gave him an advantage in trading was corporate information instead of information about the timing of his columns?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,361.132,380.344,"--It would still not be a fraud on the market participants unless there was a pre-existing relationship between Mr. Winans in this case and the people selling him the stock that he buys in advance of the column, which gave rise to a duty to disclose that information."
1987.86-422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.344,382.378,But you never have that on a trade on the open market.
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,382.378,402.007,"Well, in the cosmic sense, that I think that the securities laws presume in the discloser's staying... obligation exists even when you have open market transactions."
1987.86-422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.144,445.286,"What if the insider uses inside information that pertains not to his own corporation but to another corporation that this corporation somehow, somehow happens to have acquired?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,454.392,477.173,"That that would not be in the securities laws because there is no... that is really the situation of Tiorello, where you have information that emanates from the acquiring company side, and you then use that information in the... to buy stock of the company to be purchased... the target company."
1987.86-422,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,488.731,492.6,"Counsel, do you concede there was impropriety here, however?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,492.6,497.087,I think that there clearly was an ethical breach by Mr. Winans--
1987.86-422,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,497.087,500.456,Is there any remedy for this kind of thing?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,500.456,502.173,--Yes.
1987.86-422,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,521.035,524.321,But there is no judicial remedy of any kind?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,524.321,539.164,"There is no judicial remedy, Your Honor because there is no fraud that he has committed within the meaning of any state law, or within the meaning of any federal securities law."
1987.86-422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.901,550.888,"But why is there no fraud sufficient for a mail fraud or wire fraud, purposes?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,550.888,560.077,"--Justice O'Connor, there are I guess three main reasons that we have on the mail and wire fraud side."
1987.86-422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.671,582.86,"But the cases have been pretty generous in looking at different schemes or artifices, as sufficing for purposes of a fraud."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,582.86,610.26,"--I think that they have... that there has been, certainly pre-McNally, Your Honor, a tendency to be very expansive in the view of what is fraud, and that many cases in the Circuits have suggested that whenever one violates a rule of one's employer, there is potential mail or wire fraud exposure."
1987.86-422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.26,611.727,But you said there were three reasons.
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,616.914,631.923,"Our position is that, the kind of injury which is asserted here, namely a putative reputational injury, is not the kind of injury that is cognizable under the mail or wire fraud statutes."
1987.86-422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.923,633.209,"Well, it is more than that."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,643.315,676.702,"But the suggestion, the process... the district court held not that there was, in fact, reputational harm here; not that Winans intended reputational harm, but that because he could contemplate that, if his unethical conduct was discovered and became public, though that was not his aim, obviously; that that could cause diminished reputation of the employer and that, in turn, could have economic impact on the Wall Street Journal."
1987.86-422,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.702,684.558,"Do you not think that the employer, that the Wall Street Journal had maybe a property right in its publication schedule?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,689.712,705.389,"Well, the short answer, Justice White, is I think that there can be a property interest in the publication schedule, but the question is, in what way are they deprived of that property interest by Foster Winans' conduct?"
1987.86-422,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.94,712.911,"Well, it was certainly no longer a secret that they, if they--"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,712.911,713.994,"--But, if Foster Winans, for example--"
1987.86-422,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.994,723.35,"--have not been deprived, if they were trying to keep that secret and it is suddenly given out to a limited number of people, it is no longer a secret."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,723.35,730.456,"--But the fact of secrecy has no independent value, we submit, except vis-a-vis, competitors."
1987.86-422,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.133,752.036,Whatever property interest the paper has is suddenly gone.
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,758.523,771.95,"What we are saying is, the only way that a property interest can be said to exist is in the exclusive use of the knowledge, and that that is a meaningful interest only vis-a-vis competitors."
1987.86-422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.95,773.433,"Mr. Buchwald, why is that so?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,845.664,864.893,"The Journal itself, and very specifically, and at trial, through its testimony, disclaimed any intention of giving market advice to its readers, or to recommending or suggesting they buy or sell stocks."
1987.86-422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.893,866.578,People just read it from general interest?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,867.662,878.969,It does not seem to me that the Journal could claim to be defrauded with respect to a function which it specifically denies that it has.
1987.86-422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.575,885.506,Estoppel?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,891.027,898.383,This theory could not be used because it is not charged at all.
1987.86-422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1104.166,1117.408,"Well, I think that in Paul v. Davis, the Court really just said that reputation alone, apart from some more tangible interest, such as employment, or so forth, would not."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,1121.11,1156.216,"--Justice O'Connor, the think about reputation, and the facts there, it were the case that, because the plaintiff there had been defamed and called a ""pickpocket"", and therefore it was less likely that he would be employed by the bank as a teller, or less likely that he would get any one of a number of employment opportunities, the damage to reputation could only, as a theoretical level, as a putative injury concept, be stretched out to mean ""potential economic harm""."
1987.86-422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.012,1186.82,"Congress could, in the mail fraud statute, define v. Davis, could it not?"
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,1186.82,1188.588,I think that is clearly the case.
1987.86-422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.341,1197.86,But you say it has not done so yet?
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,1197.86,1200.579,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.422,1220.024,"But your argument is only partly that it would be ""unwise"", I take it."
1987.86-422,0,20619,don_d_buchwald,,1224.795,1226.13,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.486,1774.603,"Thank you, Mr. Buchwald."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,1776.538,1787.663,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.471,1829.323,You are speaking now to the mail fraud count or to the securities count?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,1829.323,1834.125,"In fact, in that respect, I speak to both counts, but certainly to the mail fraud count."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.542,1876.118,"Excuse me, this would have been an offense even if there had never been any publication of the fact that this is what Winans did, putting the reputation at-risk constitutes damage?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,1876.118,1878.368,"Oh, it certainly does."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.429,1952.785,Does not fraud ordinarily require that the same respect in which you are damaged I am benefitted?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,1985.339,1989.541,"In fact, I would differ there."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.739,2070.092,"But not what they sought to deprive the Journal of, as was pointed out by your opponent."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2080.251,2082.253,"--No, they were depriving it of the information."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.689,2114.289,"""That"" is what they took?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2116.324,2123.847,--The confidential information regarding the timing and the contents of the column.
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.625,2145.743,So now you can misappropriate a fact?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2145.743,2148.279,The information.
1987.86-422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.168,2161.955,And it was a confidential information which was then used by them in their scheme?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2161.955,2163.905,--Precisely.
1987.86-422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2193.958,2197.462,"Now, does McNally bear on this problem?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2197.462,2201.597,--I think McNally is wholly irrelevant to this case.
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.286,2263.404,Snep was not a criminal case.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2263.404,2271.76,"--Snep was not a criminal case, but Snep recognized that there is this duty of confidentiality."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.199,2283.151,"Yes, but if Congress wanted to say in so many words,"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2296.126,2309.551,"I hope not, because in speaking of fraud, Congress necessarily assumed the ordinary common law meaning of fraud."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.426,2352.295,"Well, more than that, you have property, and that is what is hard to take here."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2363.453,2366.472,--Confidential information.
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.472,2371.459,--is the fact of later publication and the date of the publication.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2371.459,2375.411,The confid... the property clearly is confidential information.
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.36,2433.098,What is the closest criminal fraud case that you would have to this species of property?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2443.721,2462.7,"Well, there are McNally cases where trade secrets... where I believe confidential information, and Indeed, privacy rights were obtained, where somebody obtained access."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.821,2496.773,Is that a decision of this Court?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2496.773,2497.406,--It is not in this Court.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.558,2508.414,"General Fried, I am a little troubled because, are you claiming that the obtaining of this property, namely the information, was done by fraud?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2508.414,2526.125,"The fraud, the information was misappropriated at the time either that Winans himself traded on it, as he did I think on at least one occasion, or when he communicated it to his confederates for the purpose of trading on it."
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.125,2531.511,"No, it was misused, as you say, but the acquisition of the information was not obtained by fraud?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2531.511,2531.946,No.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.837,2551.258,"I am not contending the information was, there was nothing dishonest about his finding out when the column was going to be published, was there?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2551.258,2551.591,No.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.825,2581.177,I do not know how he is guilty of mail fraud?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2581.177,2587.164,"Well, as this Court said in Grin v. Shine, ""embezzlement is fraud""."
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.164,2595.437,"Yes, but you are saying that, to complete your elements of the crime, you have got to have the harm, and you say the harm is the injury to the reputation?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2595.437,2596.437,That is correct.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.437,2607.761,"But yet you are saying it is different from the intangible right to honest and good government somehow, the intangible right to honest and good reporting, is different in intent."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2613.915,2632.562,"Well, I see this as very different from those concerns in McNally because what was the object of the fraud here was the confidential information, which does seem to be a familiar, though intangible, form of property."
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.562,2637.181,But it is also an element to deprive the Wall Street Journal of its good reputation and so-forth.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2637.181,2641.334,The harm of its... the reputation is the harm.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.392,2661.379,But you do agree that some kind of harm of that nature beyond the acquisition of the property is an essential ingredient of the offense?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2661.379,2672.02,"Well, I think of Mr. Buchwald's example of Foster Winans telling his mother about this information just because he is a gossip."
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.306,2677.841,"Yes, it is an essential element of the defense."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2677.841,2683.245,There has to be some kind of harm which is contemplated or risked.
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.445,2692.434,"If that is true, why is this ""harm"", which I would call some sort of an intangible harm, why is that different than the ""harm"" in McNally?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2692.434,2710.562,"Because in McNally, what was lacking, what was utterly lacking, was the depriving of anything like the property which in this case we have I would say we have in sufficient degree."
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.276,2746.252,"I understand that, but I suppose in a sense, one could say in McNally there was a property interest in controlling the placement of insurance and they acquired that without violating any laws by exercising their authority."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2746.252,2747.785,"One might have said that, indeed."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.272,2789.329,"I must say that the concept of putting something at-risk as harm sufficient to support a criminal charge is, it seems to me, rather strange."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2800.47,2811.761,"With respect, Justice Scalia, in every trespass action, the harm is presumed in just the way it is presumed here."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.985,2824.735,Is that the theory of it?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2832.108,2850.053,"--And the harm here is he should not be trafficking in your confidential information even though as things may turn out through your own diligence, you can put a stop to the reputational loss which might otherwise come about."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.053,2853.105,"Well, you just said that, but I do not know why that is self-evident, and I never heard it before?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2864.395,2868.531,"Well, Judge Stuart in the district court so-said--"
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.531,2869.216,I know that.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2869.216,2870.999,--and I think it is a very strong argument.
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.037,2885.559,"Now, a while ago you though there had to be something beyond the appropriation of the property?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2885.559,2888.361,"Oh, I think the harm is presumed, Justice White."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.165,2896.867,"Well, it is like your car example, you... he took my car."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2896.867,2900.485,"--He took my car, returned it, full tank of gas and no dents."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2903.187,2904.556,Turn back the odometer.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2904.556,2906.189,Turn back the odometer?
1987.86-422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2906.939,2921.166,"Yes, but I thought really, and there is a misunderstanding on my... I thought you were saying, as a matter of law, even though there is no physical or pecuniary injury, there is a legal harm by his having taken something he was not entitled to?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,2921.166,2922.934,"Yes, oh, yes."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.216,3059.454,"Well, General, do you think that this argument carries the day in the securities side of this case?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3059.454,3060.556,"Oh, I think so."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.174,3070.911,You mean just the fact that he has defrauded his employer sustains the securities?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3070.911,3092.36,"--I am glad you brought me back to the securities fraud issue, because the concern which Petitioners raise is that we are criminalizing ordinary frauds, and I think there was a fraud here; there was a breach of trust here via the securities law in an open-ended way."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.122,3175.014,"General Fried, can I... will you tell me why this hypothetical is not covered by the mail fraud statute, or perhaps it is?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3198.177,3199.545,"No, it is not."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.545,3200.595,Why not?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3200.595,3202.331,"Well, I am confident in saying it is not."
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.033,3205.633,Right.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3213.889,3221.209,I would say that it is not because there is no harm.
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.63,3229.899,The mere taking of the confidential information is the harm is what you said before.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3236.636,3244.924,"--Because, because... the notion of ""confidential information"", the notion of ""confidential information"" and of ""trust""--"
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.924,3246.943,"Doesn't involve ""Marmaduke""?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3247.776,3257.216,--are both concepts which are intended to have enough weight and seriousness not to cover every trivial peccadillo.
1987.86-422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.738,3281.866,"Well, you might draw the line there; others might draw the line between a genuine trade secret of the sort that is used in manufacturing processes or something like that, and the mere fact that an article is going to appear in the Wall Street Journal several months from now You have to draw the line somewhere, right?"
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3281.866,3285.235,"In that respect, I would draw it where the Court drew it in the Snep case."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.637,3290.972,General.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3303.297,3331.347,"--In the absence of such a work rule, for instance, if Winans had worked for the Daily Scalper instead of the Wall Street Journal, I would suppose that they would not have been given the context of the relationship that there existed, there would have been no understanding, no mutual understanding, that this kind of action is a breach of trust."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.662,3486.549,So it is a federal securities crime for any embezzler of money to buy securities?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3486.549,3487.349,Decidedly not.
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.286,3496.774,The only reason he embezzled was to buy.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3500.492,3501.926,--He... Justice White--
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.926,3504.094,"You said the connection was ""palpable""."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3504.094,3515.586,"--He had the money, the embezzler did, and he could have committed it to the parimutuel, or to the numbers racket, or to a poker game; he chose to commit it to the stock market."
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.586,3519.288,"Yes, but on the facts of the case, the reason he embezzled it was to buy securities."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3519.288,3520.321,"Yes, but he might have changed--"
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.321,3521.722,"Well, but he did not."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3521.722,3523.022,--his mind and the harm would have been there--
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.022,3523.591,But he did not.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3523.591,3524.191,--and the money in his pocket.
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.191,3525.024,But he did not.
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3530.828,3537.982,The crime is completed and fully identified at the moment he has the money in his pocket.
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3539.367,3542.319,Why can you not say that in this case?
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3542.319,3552.861,"--No, because the crime is not completed in this case until Winans either trades on the information himself--"
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.861,3553.427,"Oh, I do not know."
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3555.494,3557.146,--for the purpose of trading.
1987.86-422,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.146,3557.763,Well--
1987.86-422,1,18942,charles_fried,,3557.763,3562.299,"If he just told it to his mother to satisfy gossip interests, there would have been no effects."
1987.86-422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3572.405,3573.707,Thank you General Fried.
1987.86-422,2,20619,don_d_buchwald,,3576.024,3578.274,"Thank you, Your Honor."
