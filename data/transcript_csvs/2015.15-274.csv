2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.335,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15-274, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. Ms. Toti."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,8.335,23.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Texas requirements undermine the careful balance struck in Casey between States' legitimate interests in regulating abortion and women's fundamental liberty to make personal decisions about their pregnancies."
2015.15-274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,29.73,38.575,"Ms. Toti, there is a preliminary question -- would you address that -- that this claim is precluded."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,57.825,67.74,"Your Honor, it's not precluded because material facts relevant to the claim developed subsequent to entry of judgment in the Abbott case."
2015.15-274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,67.74,71.89,But you could have amended -- you could have asked for supplemental briefing.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,81.68,87.995,In Abbott the plaintiffs brought the -- the new facts to the attention of the court of appeals.
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.395,112.125,But you're asking -- you made allegations concerning those same claims.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,122.88,124.87,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.28,154.295,And what's this key new evidence?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,154.295,162.96,The -- the evidence is the clinic closures that resulted from enforcement -- actual enforcement of the admitting-privileges requirement.
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.67,189.065,"Well, there is very little specific evidence in the record in this case with respect to why any particular clinic closed."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,233.5,235.45,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,235.77,237.03,What's the difference?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,237.03,243.26,"Well, first of all, the State had an opportunity to bring forward evidence in this case about the reasons why --"
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,243.26,245.78,Was it that -- was that their burden?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,245.78,246.35,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.02,263.65,What -- what evidence is that?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,263.65,264.985,"There are a couple of things, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.88,285.04,What?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,285.04,285.645,-- alone --
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,285.645,286.33,I'm sorry.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,291.55,310.22,"The -- the -- the timing is part of the evidence, Your Honor, and the testimony of the plaintiffs about the reasons why their clinics closed. So that the plaintiffs testified that clinics closed in anticipation of enforcement in some cases, and in some cases because of actual enforcement of the requirements."
2015.15-274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.22,318.66,"Can we go on to the second piece; that is, the ambulatory surgical centers? That was not part of the last case."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,327.585,328.245,Yes.
2015.15-274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.84,349.1,"Well, certainly in the Federal system, and I assume in many States as well, regulations sometimes take years to promulgate."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,365.45,372.6,I would disagree that -- that the extent of the burden that the law would impose was clear on the face of the statute.
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.76,414.179,So you think you can separately challenge the admitting-privilege provision and the ASC provision?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,414.179,416.27,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,417.2,430.215,"So if you can separately challenge them, if you challenge just the admitting-privileges provision, how would you factor in -- presumably, you would have to assume that the ASC provision was not under challenge."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,448.42,455.785,"I -- I would disagree with that, Your Honor, because each of these requirements is extremely burdensome on its own."
2015.15-274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.99,519.92,"What I think the Chief Justice asked -- I don't want to take words out of his mouth -- but I think the question was, one of the two lines that's been asked, is that in the district opinion at page 7, the district court has said that if the ASC regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,571.845,573.41,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,606.86,607.96,Where -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,610.02,641.6,"Your Honor, I can provide specific pin sites during my rebuttal, but the evidence is in the plaintiffs' testimony about the reasons why their clinics closed. Each of the plaintiffs' class testified that their clinics closed either in anticipation of enforcement of these requirements, knowing that -- that the clinic would not be able to continue operating once the requirements took effect, and as a result of that, either they needed to move resources to remaining clinics to ensure that some clinics would continue to operate in the State --"
2015.15-274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.6,645.43,What'd they say? Could you give us any record references later or on rebuttal?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,645.43,645.985,Yes.
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,645.985,654.77,"As to how many, of the total that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about the reason for the closure?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,654.77,660.35,"Well, 11 of them, Your Honor, closed on the day that the admitting privileges took effect."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,660.35,660.54,Yeah.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,665.98,669.46,"To -- to date, roughly 20 clinics have closed."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,669.46,674.085,"And of the 20, how -- as to how many do you have direct evidence?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,674.085,677.66,"I -- approximately 12, Your Honor, direct evidence."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,677.66,683.66,Because if -- if you go through this -- now we're not talking about a huge number of facilities.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,716.405,717.35,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,717.35,717.96,Okay.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,734.54,737.65,"Well, Your Honor, that evidence is not in the record."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,737.65,742.27,"Well, I understand that. And you put quite a bit of evidence that's not in the record in your brief."
2015.15-274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.475,755.44,You said you had direct evidence for 12 clinics and you were going to supply us with that -- those record citations later.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,757.925,758.69,Yes.
2015.15-274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,761.94,769.445,"Ms. Toti, could I -- could I just make sure I understand it, because you said 11 were closed on the day that the admitting-privileges requirement took effect; is that correct?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,769.445,770.16,That's correct.
2015.15-274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,770.16,785.725,"And is it right that in the two-week period that the ASC requirement was in effect, that over a dozen facilities shut their doors, and then when that was stayed, when that was lifted, they reopened again immediately; is that right?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,785.725,787.25,"That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,787.71,795.87,"It's almost like the perfect controlled experiment as to the effect of the law, isn't it? It's like you put the law into effect, 12 clinics closed."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,798.55,800.4,That's absolutely correct.
2015.15-274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,811.13,817.65,"The -- the State, I think, is going to talk about the capacity of the remaining clinics."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,828.605,831.06,"I don't think that's necessary, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.35,871.625,"There -- there have been some changes, like a -- a major clinic -- I don't quite know the adjective they use for it -- in San Antonio. But there -- suppose there were evidence that there was a -- a capacity and a -- and a capability to -- to build these kinds of clinics, would that be of importance? And then it would show that this law has an effect, and a beneficial effect so far as the legislature is concerned."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,871.625,881.9,"If the Court had any doubts about the capacity of the remaining clinics, a remand would certainly provide the Petitioners with -- with the opportunity to supplement the evidence already in the record."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,898.03,914.265,Is it correct that the number of ambulatory surgical centers performing abortion has increased by 50 percent since this law went into effect?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,914.265,921.24,"There have -- since this law has taken effect, three new ambulatory surgery centers have opened."
2015.15-274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,959.7,961.63,"Well, one -- one quick question about capacity."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,985.295,998.625,"Well, there -- there -- so I see that I'm getting into my rebuttal time, Your Honor, but there is evidence in the record about the -- the number of abortions that were performed on an annual basis, the geographic distribution of -- of those abortions."
2015.15-274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.4,1009.21,You -- you had -- we have absorbed so much of your time with the threshold question.
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1014.14,1019.445,"Why don't -- why don't you take an extra five minutes, and we'll be sure to afford you rebuttal time after that?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1019.445,1030.405,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. So fundamentally, these laws impose heavy burdens on abortion access that are not medically justified."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.36,1041.29,Do you think there's a rational basis for the law based on the benefits that the legislature saw?
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1041.29,1044.39,"I do not, Your Honor, because --"
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1044.39,1049.505,"Well, I thought you expressly did not challenge the law as lacking a rational basis."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1049.505,1053.81,We -- we did not preserve our rational basis claim.
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1065.66,1072.34,"Well, we have to assume it -- we have to assume it does since you're not raising that challenge, don't we?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1072.34,1089.24,"Because the law actually undermines the State's interest in health rather than advancing it by causing an increase in later abortions and self-induced abortions, we wouldn't concede that it's rationally related to the State's interest in health, but are --"
2015.15-274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.24,1093.625,"You said ""even if."" The test is undue burden, not rational basis."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1093.625,1095.425,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.36,1117.64,"I don't -- how is that logical? I mean, the question is whether there's an undue burden or a substantial obstacle."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1146.09,1155.1,"In order to determine whether a burden is undue, Your Honor, we -- we have to consider what the burden is in relation to."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1178.05,1191.195,"I thought the undue burden and substantial obstacle went to whether it was undue in light of the woman's right to exercise her right to an abortion, not with respect to the State interest that's asserted."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1191.195,1195.765,"Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's both."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.09,1249.09,Can I walk through the burden a moment? There's two types of early abortion at -- at play here.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1260.535,1265.68,"Under Texas law, she must take them at the facility, but -- but that is otherwise correct."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.68,1266.33,I'm sorry.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1269.425,1270.51,"That's correct, yes."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1270.51,1270.99,All right.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1283.83,1285.745,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.745,1286.585,All right.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1317.63,1335.26,"There -- there is -- there's absolutely no testimony in -- in the record and -- and no evidence, you know, in -- in any of the amicus briefs that there is a medical benefit to having a medication abortion at a -- a multimillion-dollar surgical facility."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1388.47,1391.95,If the Chief may permit me to finish my two-part question?
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.95,1392.47,Sure.
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1392.47,1399.8,"The second is the D&C, the dilation and -- what's it called? Dilation and --"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1399.8,1400.44,Curettage.
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1400.44,1401.43,-- curettage.
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1440.625,1441.56,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.87,1473.38,"So your point, I'm taking, is that the two main health reasons show that this law was targeted at abortion only?"
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1473.38,1474.635,That's absolutely correct.
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1474.99,1475.49,Is there any other --
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1475.49,1476.695,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.695,1495.7,"I'm sorry. Is there any other medical condition by taking the pills that are required to be done in hospital, not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital, but an independent, you know -- I know there are cancer treatments by pills now."
2015.15-274,0,62674,stephanie_toti,,1500.145,1501.87,"None, Your Honor."
2015.15-274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1512.89,1531.735,"Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli."
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1531.735,1552.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The effects of the Texas law at issue in this case are much more extreme than those of any abortion law that this Court has considered since Casey. This law closes most abortion facilities in the State, puts extreme stress on the few facilities that remain open, and exponentially increases the obstacles confronting women who seek abortions in the State."
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1567.92,1572.73,Is this true of every provision of the -- of the ASC law?
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1572.73,1577.18,"No, I -- I don't think it is true about every provision in the regulations, Justice Alito."
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1577.18,1579.76,"Not the regulations -- yes, in the regulations."
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1579.76,1579.87,Yes.
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1579.87,1584.435,Every single provision. Then why was the whole thing held to be unconstitutional?
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1584.435,1588.19,So I -- I agree with the premise of Your Honor's question.
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1615.02,1627.24,"But there are -- there are things that go -- that go -- I haven't checked everything as compared the abortion -- the prior abortion clinic licensing law against the ASC requirements, but there are some where there's an increase in what's required."
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1646.53,1650.47,So I -- I don't want to state an opinion one way or the other about that.
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1686.33,1686.75,"Well, it's all --"
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1686.75,1688.21,-- the State's regulatory problems.
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1688.21,1693.17,"It's work, but maybe the district court should have done that work. I mean, I read through this, and I was surprised."
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1719.61,1719.7,So --
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.7,1723.12,"I don't know why things couldn't have been severed out, if there were some that were --"
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1723.12,1731.805,"I -- I think some could have been, if the Court believes a remand is appropriate for the -- for the remedy to be more carefully tailored in the way that the Court did in the Ayotte case."
2015.15-274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.67,1877.865,About 20 percent.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1877.865,1878.59,20 percent.
2015.15-274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1927.58,1945.715,"Do you think the district court would have had discretion -- the district court having substantial equitable powers that appellate courts don't -- to say we're going to stay this requirement for two-and-a-half, three years, to see if the capacity problem can be cured. Could a -- could a district judge do that?"
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1945.715,1948.25,"You know, I -- I apologize, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.98,1960.03,"I mean, district judges often think they can do anything. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1960.03,1982.15,"But -- but I do think, as I said, with respect to the capacity problem, the key thing here is that when, in addition to these ASC clinics not providing more abortions once half the clinics in the State closed, you had -- and this is, again, in Dr. Grossman's testimony -- significant increases in the overall number of abortions, particularly in the parts of the State that were far away from the major cities, the northern --"
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1982.15,1987.295,There is no evidence -- there's no evidence of the actual capacity of these clinics.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2007.85,2008.37,"Well, I think --"
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2008.37,2008.4,-- are.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2008.4,2011.07,-- I think you have expert testimony in that regard.
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2011.07,2011.31,Yeah.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2017.15,2017.55,"Well, it is."
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2018.85,2019.57,"Well, common sense --"
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2019.57,2026.33,"But beyond that, as I said, Justice Alito, they studied the period of time in which half the clinics in the State were closed."
2015.15-274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2033.35,2041.31,"He said that -- that the number of -- the percentage of abortions at the ASCs went down by 4.4 percent, and there was an increased demand for abortion."
2015.15-274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.08,2064.895,"I thought that the Grossman affidavit, which I have -- I grant you, it's going on the briefs -- but it said at Table -- affidavit page 9, Table 2, says that the number of abortions that are, on average, performed annually at the remaining clinics is 2,000."
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2078.585,2079.085,Yes.
2015.15-274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.085,2079.94,Okay.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2079.94,2102.14,"In -- in the short time I have remaining, I'd like to finish with one point, if I could. I think, ultimately, the question before you is whether the right here is going to retain real substance, and whether the balance -- whether the balance struck in Casey still holds. If that right still does retain real substance, then this law cannot stand."
2015.15-274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2131.2,2137.085,I would have thought -- Casey and Gonzales also said substantial obstacle.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2159.68,2165.89,"Well, I think it's actually in the interest of government to look at it the way that we're suggesting it ought to be looked at."
2015.15-274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2168.775,2169.21,Sure.
2015.15-274,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2169.21,2188.82,"And I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that is because, you know, it is one thing to say that you're going to impose a requirement that does work as much as to be the kind of obstacle that this requirement -- that these requirements do, when you have justification that's frankly flimsy and the American Medical Association has told you was groundless."
2015.15-274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.03,2245.025,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2245.025,2246.25,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice --"
2015.15-274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2246.25,2249.1,"I suppose I should -- before you get started, we'll afford you an additional eight minutes."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2250.12,2256.455,"An extra thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Res judicata bars the facial challenges."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.85,2285.805,"Well, how many women are located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2285.805,2299.42,"Justice Ginsburg, JA 242 provides that 25 percent of Texas women of reproductive age are not within 100 miles of an ASC."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2305.76,2306.54,It includes --
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.54,2310.835,That's -- that's odd that you point to the New Mexico facility.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2353.63,2362.92,"The policy set by Texas is that the standard of care for abortion clinics should rise to the level of ASCs for clinics, and admitting privileges for doctors."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.09,2376.85,Then why should it count those clinics?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2376.85,2391.68,"Well, here, the evidence in the record showed that this particular clinic was 1 mile across the border that was still in the El Paso metroplex, and women in El Paso often used that facility to obtain abortions. So that would go into the contextual analysis of this particular as-applied challenge."
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2406.02,2419.41,"Mr. Keller, the -- the statistics that I gleaned from the record were that 900,000 women live further than 150 miles from a provider; 750,000, three-quarters of a million, further than 200 miles."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2439.0,2450.14,"Well, Justice Kagan, first of all, I believe the statistics at JA 242, which is their expert testimony, would not account for McAllen or El Paso, but in looking at the fraction of women affected."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2487.49,2520.405,"When there's a need. Meaning, where are you taking an account in the undue-burden analysis the value of the need being -- of being imposed? Meaning, even if I grant you that in some circumstances travel time is necessary because you just can't get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a particular area, so you might have to impose a burden that might be undue in other circumstances."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2535.0,2538.45,"Well, there would be three elements of the doctrine."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2539.76,2540.97,I'm not talking about the doctrine.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2568.99,2573.325,And what -- and what Casey said is the substantial obstacle test examines access to abortion.
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2587.32,2601.49,"What -- what is the benefit of the medical, the two pills that you take, what is the benefit of having an ambulatory surgical center to take two pills when there's no -- no surgical procedure at all involved?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2601.49,2603.395,"Two responses, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.19,2623.45,"On that complication, that complication is likely to arise near the women's home, much more likely to arise near her home, which the 30 miles has nothing to do with."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2623.45,2629.5,"Well, first of all, the two travel distances, that was about the drug protocol. That's a different part of the bill."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2634.91,2639.61,I'm not -- I'm not talking about the prior lawsuit; I'm talking about this lawsuit.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2661.525,2665.23,"Of course, most abortions are surgical abortions in the State."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.23,2667.865,"Well, I'm asking just about the medical."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2667.865,2668.76,That's right.
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.38,2672.145,And -- and just it's -- I can't imagine.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2681.93,2684.23,"Well, there would be surgery in a complication."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.15,2693.55,"If it is a complication, it is not going to occur on the spot."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2710.2,2719.98,"Although when the significant majority of women are living within 50 miles of the clinic, in most situations they are going to be in the facility."
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2731.23,2761.92,"Before you get -- is it -- is the underlying premise of -- of your argument, Mr. Keller, and of the State's position, that the thrust, the impetus, the effect of this law is to increase surgical abortions as distinct from medical abortions, and that that is within the State's authority to do? Because my reading indicated that medical abortions are up nationwide but down significantly in Texas."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2761.92,2773.98,"It would certainly be permissible to regulate both surgical and -- and drug-induced abortions, and in drug-induced abortions, since there are greater complications. In the first lawsuit, Fifth Circuit noted expert testimony."
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2775.22,2790.62,"But I thought an underlying theme, or at least an underlying factual demonstration, is that this law has really increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2790.62,2791.515,Yeah.
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.16,2796.76,"You might say that this is within the authority of the State to do, but --"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2796.76,2797.93,Given the higher --
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.93,2799.855,And I want to know what your position is on that.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2799.855,2813.585,"And Justice Kennedy, given the greater complication rates from drug-induced abortions, the legislature would be permitted to act in that way. But in any event, Petitioners have not challenged that particular part of the district court's holding that gave them as-applied relief on the drug-induced abortion part."
2015.15-274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2842.2,2849.265,What -- what evidence would you have put in on the capacity issue if you had been afforded that opportunity?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2849.265,2849.77,Well --
2015.15-274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.77,2863.875,"Evidence that would rebut the statistically significant showing on the other side about capacity, and also the circumstantial evidence about the timing of the -- of the closures."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2863.875,2883.15,"Well, this is not in the record, but in Petitioners' first lawsuit -- this is Exhibit K -- to their application to vacate the stay in this Court in the first lawsuit, the Abbott litigation, they went clinic by clinic in a chart -- excuse me -- and they tried to estimate the number of abortions that could be performed in those facilities."
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.56,2896.63,Before -- before the Act?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2896.63,2902.33,"Well, yes, yes, because the Houston Planned -- Planned Parenthood operates five of the nine ASCs."
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.78,2934.33,"And you asked to put in this evidence, and then the court said no, we will not let you put in the evidence?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2934.33,2937.26,We didn't put in the evidence because Petitioners bore the burden --
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2937.26,2940.045,"I asked, did you ask to put in this evidence?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2940.045,2940.57,No.
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.57,2940.94,No.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2969.995,2970.575,Correct.
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.575,2971.215,Okay.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2984.82,2985.32,That's correct.
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.32,2985.86,Okay.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3035.05,3037.93,"Justice Breyer, that is not in the record."
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.93,3038.65,But so --
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3038.65,3038.88,What I'm --
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.88,3074.3,"-- Judge Posner then seems to be correct where he says he could find in the entire nation, in his opinion, only one arguable example of such a thing, and he's not certain that even that one is correct. So what is the benefit to the woman of a procedure that is going to cure a problem of which there is not one single instance in the nation, though perhaps there is one, but not in Texas. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3074.3,3079.6,"Justice Breyer, the National Abortion Federation previously recommended that women use abortion doctors --"
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.6,3080.38,I didn't ask that.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3187.125,3191.7,That has never been the test under Casey about substantial obstacle.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3211.92,3212.43,That's interesting.
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3212.43,3241.945,"Well, can the legislature say anything, General? I mean, if the legislature says we have a -- a health-related abortion regulation here, we've looked around the country and we think that there are ten great hospitals in the country, you know, Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and we're going to make all our abortion facilities conform to the standards of those hospitals, and that will -- you know, that will increase medical care."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3255.385,3258.63,"Under this Court's precedent, abortion can be treated differently."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3260.66,3261.09,"Well, wait a minute --"
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3261.09,3264.845,So every abortion facility has to hit the standards of MGH.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3268.075,3272.395,"Well, there would have to be medical evidence."
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3283.645,3292.285,"I'm sure that there's medical evidence that if every hospital, if every facility was as good as Massachusetts General, they would be better facilities."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3308.82,3310.36,And that was the holding in Simopoulos.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3311.54,3312.61,"Well, do you think -- would you put --"
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3312.61,3340.49,"Would it not be the case that -- would it not be the case that a State could increase the -- the standard of care as high as it wants so long as there's not an -- an undue burden on the women seeking abortion? So, you know, if they could -- if they could increase the standard of care up to the very highest anywhere in the country and it wouldn't be a burden on the women, well, that would be a benefit to them."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3342.675,3343.05,No.
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3347.115,3352.965,But doesn't that show that the undue-burden test is weighed against what the State's interest is?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3352.965,3354.16,Justice Kennedy --
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3354.16,3362.3,"I mean, are they -- are they -- are these two completely discrete analytical categories, undue burden, and we don't look at the State's interest?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3362.3,3371.89,"What Casey noted was that the undue-burden test is, is there a purpose or an effect of the substantial obstacle to access? And that's a question about access."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3395.12,3422.37,"But what is the legitimate interest in protecting their health? What evidence is there that under the prior law, the prior law was not sufficiently protective of the women's health? As I understand it, this is one of the lowest-risk procedures, and you give a horrible from Pennsylvania, but absolutely nothing from Texas."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3442.795,3451.58,"In Petitioner's first lawsuit, Planned Parenthood admitted that over 210 women annually are hospitalized because of abortion complications. Here at JA 266 --"
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3451.58,3459.55,"As compared to childbirth, many, many -- much riskier procedure, is it not?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3459.55,3464.29,"Well, the American Center for Law and Justice and Former Abortion Providers' amicus brief dispute that."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3466.25,3470.05,Is there really any dispute that childbirth -- (Laughter.)
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3470.05,3474.13,-- is a much riskier procedure than an early stage abortion?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3474.13,3481.47,"Justice Ginsburg, those amicus briefs point out what when you look at record linkage statistic, instead of complication reporting, there may be a difference."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3492.45,3510.615,"By hospitals? Underreported -- most of the complications you're talking about were reported at hospitals, correct? Yes, there is some evidence of not reporting other things outside the hospital, but you know the number of -- hospitals are accurately reporting."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3510.615,3514.9,"Well, abortion clinics are -- have to report complications in Texas."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3518.04,3519.365,Complications within their clinic?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3519.365,3519.96,That's right.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3522.53,3526.585,"What's the percentage of 210 from 70,000? My math is pretty horrible."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3527.795,3532.715,And -- and the statistic at JA 266 is it is lower than 1 percent.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3534.27,3548.895,"I don't mean to -- to negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone, and -- and don't take my question as that, but there are people who die from complications from aspirin."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3562.195,3563.05,But in examining --
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3563.05,3567.08,"There has to be some tie between the benefit and the burden, doesn't there?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3567.08,3569.71,"In examining not effect, but the purpose."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3575.26,3605.86,"Well, don't you think that you can read that from the fact that there are so many other medical treatments whose complication rates are so disproportionately higher, and the legislature is only targeting abortion when there is nothing about the figures before it that show a risk so unusual that it needs greater attention?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3605.86,3608.27,But that would have been Simopoulos; it would have been Mazurek.
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3612.68,3616.43,"I don't see where this fits in, I mean, to the argument."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3620.86,3621.07,Good.
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3622.02,3632.54,"But the -- the -- what their purpose is, that they're worried about these complications and they want to make life safer for the women."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3711.03,3734.1,"Justice Breyer, about self-induced abortion, the evidence in the record on that were two points of testimony, both from McAllen where Petitioners prevailed, as-applied challenges could be brought in areas -- for instance, if there could be shown a substantial obstacle based on travel distance, the four clinics that closed in West Texas between El Paso and San Antonio, all those closed before the admitting-privileges requirement took effect."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3737.42,3738.28,Keller -- Keller --
2015.15-274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3738.28,3740.49,I'd like to hear what he says.
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3740.49,3749.39,"As-applied challenge is a real problem with that, because suppose you bring in that as-applied challenge and you're successful."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3779.505,3784.14,"Justice Ginsburg, the McAllen clinic reopened, and as Justice Kagan mentioned, clinics did reopen."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3823.29,3832.935,"There was a stipulation -- there was a stipulation that is ""No currently-licensed abortion facility meets the ASC requirements."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3856.94,3861.27,And that would go to the ASC requirement as opposed to the facial challenge of the admitting-privileges requirement.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3893.65,3906.87,"Can I ask: Were they opened as a result of the law, or were they planned to be opened before the law went into effect? Because I think that makes a difference to me that they were planned to be opened."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3924.05,3924.7,Well --
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3924.7,3935.64,"In other words, it's fortuitous that they've come into existence, but it was in -- their need was not there -- was independent of the reduced number of facilities elsewhere."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3935.64,3939.37,Legislature provided 13 months to come into compliance.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3946.32,3948.41,Most of them don't choose to provide abortions.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3948.41,3949.02,That's correct.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3950.77,3963.665,So what you don't know is what -- do you have enough resources to open up an ASC if you're going to do abortions? Are you going to get enough developers to -- to invest in your work?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3963.665,3964.805,Yeah.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3967.98,3979.635,Can I ask about McAllen? There was testimony in the record that at least four doctors had -- from that spot had asked for admitting privileges.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4014.745,4019.13,"Because, Justice Sotomayor, that was the only named plaintiff for the as-applied --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4019.13,4022.62,But that -- but -- if -- yes.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4043.29,4048.86,"Well, that wasn't the only one of the four doctors that joined this lawsuit, because most of the doctors and clinics in Texas are not part of this lawsuit --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4048.86,4054.495,But you just lift the requirement because you know that it's the only clinic in the area.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4054.495,4055.17,Well --
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4055.17,4073.705,"So if any doctor who's licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges, they should be permitted to work in that clinic. Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are provided with their fundamental right to choose?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4073.705,4077.685,"Justice Sotomayor, it would not be an indentured situation."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4080.26,4081.03,But she wants to leave --
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4081.03,4084.56,"-- didn't perform abortion, then another doctor could bring in a future as-applied challenge --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4084.56,4084.9,All right.
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4085.705,4092.615,"General, could -- could I ask -- could I go back to a question that -- something that you said earlier? And tell me if I'm misquoting you."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4121.98,4124.005,"Correct, in this Court's -- in Simopoulos."
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4124.005,4128.05,And I guess I just want to know why would Texas do that? (Laughter.)
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4128.05,4135.6,"When there are complications from abortion that's in the record, Texas can enact laws to promote safety."
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4135.6,4146.47,"No, I know, but -- but the assumption of the question, and I think you haven't challenged this assumption, is that there are many procedures that are much higher risk: Colonoscopies, liposuctions, we could go on and on."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4156.215,4163.78,"Justice Kagan, this bill was passed in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal that prompted Texas and many other States to reexamine their abortion regulations."
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4163.78,4177.65,"But, of course, the -- I mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made abortion facilities such that that can never happen, because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your credit."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4204.625,4216.11,I think the amicus brief for the 121 Texas legislators that canvasses the medical evidence and canvasses statements confirms that that -- that there were complications that these laws do have benefits.
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4217.62,4218.64,Isn't it true --
2015.15-274,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4218.64,4234.46,Are you -- are you in -- you're not really contesting that there are greater complications in abortion facilities than there are with a great deal of medical procedures that do -- that are not subject to the same standard of regulation.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4234.46,4241.1,"Yeah, brain surgery, for instance, just like Simopoulos, would almost certainly have -- it -- it would have higher risk of complication. But the point is to --"
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4241.1,4267.59,"General, as to -- as to rogue facilities, which Justice Kagan just mentioned, one of the amicus briefs cites instance after instance where Whole Woman's facilities have been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: Holes in the floor where -- where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4269.14,4274.19,Stories similar to that are also raised in the 121 Texas legislators' amicus briefs.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4274.19,4274.75,"But, I'm sorry --"
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4274.75,4276.06,These are not stories --
2015.15-274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4276.06,4276.76,Justice Alito.
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4276.76,4284.305,"These are, as I understand it, actual reports of -- of inspections of those facilities."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4284.305,4288.96,"The amicus briefs do discuss that, and the complications from Whole Woman's Health were underreported to the State."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4290.725,4303.32,"Random -- Texas, under the prior law, has the right to make random inspections. Was -- the problem in Pennsylvania was this filthy clinic hadn't been looked at by anyone from the State in 16 years."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4322.845,4330.595,"Texas did have existing regulations, but increasing the standard of care is valid, particularly not only in light of --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4330.595,4333.66,It's valid only if it's taking care of a real problem.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4333.66,4336.91,And there were -- the -- abortion complications and underreported questions --
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4336.91,4337.2,"Well, no, no, no."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4381.72,4390.15,"The constitutional standard for whether a State can make abortion safer can't be that it can only prevent the Gosnell situation, and there are complications."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4390.15,4410.11,"Well, but -- yeah, but -- but you have to see, as Justice Breyer asked you earlier, why are the problems? Isn't this a self-created problem? What happened in Texas independent of Gosnell that raised the Gosnell-like situation in Texas that made --"
2015.15-274,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4410.11,4410.33,Gosnell.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4410.33,4426.36,"-- the legislature so concerned after so many years about taking care of this greater risk in abortions, as opposed to all the other procedures that are performed in non-ASC facilities?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4426.36,4428.68,"Because there are complications in abortion, and this was a top --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4428.68,4433.735,"But there's complications in colonoscopies, and colonoscopies are, what, 15 times --"
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4433.735,4435.605,28.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4437.75,4440.37,28 percent higher.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4441.625,4445.83,But legislatures react to topics that are of public concern.
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4507.2,4512.69,"Well, that's the problem. Once a clinic closes -- you said McCallen reopened, but that was very swift."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4528.345,4531.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, my time has expired, if may address it."
2015.15-274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4531.46,4531.825,Sure.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4531.825,4535.67,"Except even there, the clinic was not just closed for a single day."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4556.76,4560.13,Why isn't that self-evident in any area that's --
2015.15-274,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4560.13,4561.665,Sonia is off.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4561.665,4566.16,"This area of western Texas, it's as big as California."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4567.885,4571.5,"I'm not sure about California, but it certainly is a large size."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4571.5,4572.05,Huge area.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4572.05,4572.58,Absolutely.
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4572.58,4588.78,"Why isn't it self-evident if you have a law that says you can only be an ACS provider, and who's going to come in and say, I can't be an ACS provider, but it's an undue burden on me, or it's an undue burden that's self-evident on the women in that area?"
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4588.78,4590.72,"Well, the right is possessed by the women."
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4592.15,4592.51,Exactly.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4596.32,4597.44,Because there was no --
2015.15-274,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4597.44,4610.74,"You can't have a law that has marginal, if any, medical benefit be applied to this procedure anywhere where there's an undue burden on people -- on women."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4610.74,4612.9,Planned Parenthood had four clinics in West Texas.
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4628.28,4638.955,"May I ask you one question? You earlier in your argument, you were quoting how many women are within a reasonable range of the clinic."
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4699.69,4700.04,Well --
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4700.04,4705.24,Isn't that the clear message of Casey and the husband notification --
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4705.24,4705.79,When a law --
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4705.79,4706.185,-- exception?
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4706.185,4712.25,"When a law is regulating women, as it would in the spousal-notification provision, that might be different."
2015.15-274,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4729.19,4737.27,But this is about -- what it's about is that a woman has a fundamental right to make this choice for herself.
2015.15-274,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4754.025,4754.81,Yes.

2015.15-274,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4849.1,4852.4,And that -- that's the book? The last evidence was from Dr. Grossman?
2015.15-274,3,62674,stephanie_toti,,4852.4,4855.28,JA 229 is from Dr. Grossman's.
2015.15-274,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4855.28,4863.15,"At page 232, he said, ""I am not here offering any opinion on the cause of the decline in the number of abortion facilities."""
2015.15-274,3,62674,stephanie_toti,,4863.15,4863.97,That's correct.
2015.15-274,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4889.49,4905.875,Can you tell me why Planned Parenthood left the western area? The General says that Planned Parenthood -- that ASC and the -- and the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the closures in the western area of Texas.
2015.15-274,3,62674,stephanie_toti,,4905.875,4921.47,"Well, the -- the two clinics in El Paso, which is in -- in -- in that western region of Texas that would be forced to close as a result of these requirements, are not operated by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood doesn't have any clinics in Texas. The plaintiff in this case and another independent provider operate those clinics."
