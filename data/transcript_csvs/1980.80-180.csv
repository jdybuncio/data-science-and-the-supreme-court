1980.80-180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.03,We'll hear arguments first this morning in McDaniel v. Sanchez.
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,9.278,13.433,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.749,241.233,"Your opposition disagrees with that, don't they?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,241.233,275.751,"--I know they do, Your Honor, but I disagree with my opposition, because I think that the case of Wilson v. Weller makes it very clear, both in its holding and its distinguishing of another Texas Supreme Court case that where in fact election precincts... and we're not talking about Commissioners' precincts at this point, we're talking about election precincts, when election precincts are divided, or the boundaries are re-drawn... it can only be done in July or August and at no other time."
1980.80-180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.893,353.001,Did the District Court in any way alter the plan as proposed?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,353.001,355.468,"No, Your Honor, the District Court did not."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.604,418.115,Did you argue to the Fifth Circuit that the Commissioners' Court didn't have power to reapportion itself in accordance with this plan?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,418.115,420.615,"We did in a motion for rehearing, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.921,438.67,Well because the per curiam in the Court of Appeals says
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,447.899,473.592,"Well I think, Your Honor, that the legislative responsibilities of which the Fifth Circuit was speaking was... a one to which this Court has addressed so many times, and that is simply the preparation of a plan or the submission of a plan at the direction of the Trial Court rather than the preparation of that plan by the Trial Court itself."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.621,485.884,"That isn't quite what this language says, is it?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,485.884,486.352,I'm sorry?
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.352,496.599,That isn't quite what this language says; you're saying... all you're saying is that the party to a lawsuit was asked to submit a plan and it did.
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,499.676,538.988,"Well, Your Honor, I can only suppose what the Fifth Circuit was speaking to there, but I think that all the Fifth Circuit was saying was that this was not a plan which was a court-ordered plan; it was not a plan which was prepared judicially it was prepared judicially it was prepared legislatively, in the sense that the trial court told the county, one of the parties, to go out and prepare and return with a plan and the county did return with a plan and the county did return with a plan and in that sense it was a legislative plan."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.534,561.793,"Would you make the same argument if the Court had simply issued a declaratory judgment invalidating the old plan and giving the Commissioners' Court a certain time to come up with a new ordinance or whatever... what is it you called it, an ordinance, or--"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,561.793,566.024,--It would be an order of Commissioners' Court--
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.024,567.008,"--An order, yes."
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,575.474,588.765,"--Well, in truth, Your Honor, that is what is done with the exception that the trial court did not tell the Commissioners' Court to go reapportion itself and--"
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.765,592.405,"It said... submit a new plan, that's what they said."
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,592.405,606.851,"--They said submit a new plan to the Court, not go out and prepare one and adopt it and follow such procedures as might be appropriate if you were not in the middle of a suit challenging the constitutionality xx exist xx plan."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.851,629.14,"Well xx that in order to comply with the Court's view of what was wrong with the old plan, that the Commissioners' Court would not have the power under your view of their power, to reapportion themselves constitutionally?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,633.685,634.732,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.661,655.785,So it could have complied with the constitutional requirements on its own?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,655.785,659.424,It could have complied with that.
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.265,670.327,Well that's what I'm getting at.
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,679.511,709.435,"Well, truthfully that question was not litigated, and I know it is raised by the Respondent, Your Honor, but the answer is it would not have had the power to do it in the abstract, if there had been no lawsuit, the Commissioners' Court would not have had the power under Texas law to redrawn its Commissioner precinct lines if, in order to do that, it had to split some existing election precinct lines."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.442,751.184,"So if the Commissioners' Court had responded to the court by saying in order to satisfy you we would have to exceed our powers and we just can't, we just are forbidden to propose the plan?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,751.184,754.465,If that--
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.465,757.54,"Then the Court would have had to draw up its own plan, I suppose."
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,763.586,764.398,--That would be true.
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.848,774.067,Or a claim of inability?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,774.067,775.362,--That's true.
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.608,796.619,"Well you, in essence claim that they were forbidden under state law to give a legislative response to the Court's request, which is a perfectly legitimate argument."
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,796.619,820.5,"--It's a legitimate argument, Your Honor, but in all candor, that's not really what I am saying, because I understand you to be asking me whether it would have been physically possible to come up with some other plan which would have achieved the one-man-one-vote result that was desired without splitting any of the sub-precincts, these election precincts."
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.5,821.218,And you think it wasn't?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,821.218,821.593,Sir?
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.593,822.859,You don't think it was possible?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,822.859,824.702,I don't know whether it was or not.
1980.80-180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.155,830.825,"Well if it was impossible, the Commissioners' Court wouldn't have had the power to achieve it."
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,830.825,831.513,--That's true.
1980.80-180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.37,859.641,"Well then, is what you're saying that had these original plaintiffs simply come to the Commissioners' court and said we don't think the present voting lines conform to one-man-one-vote rule, we want you to change them, that they would not have had the authority under Texas law to change them and the plaintiffs would have had to go into federal court to get them changed?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,859.641,861.844,"No, Your Honor, that's not the case."
1980.80-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.709,970.005,"Before you get into your argument, may I ask a question about the legislative authority?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,984.061,985.356,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.657,1033.244,"Well then, if there's that restriction on breaking up election precincts and if that would prevent a one-person-one-vote satisfactory response would it not necessarily follow that that restriction was invalid as a matter of federal law?"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,1033.244,1040.943,"I haven't had the question, Your Honor, and I don't know whether it would be or not."
1980.80-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.474,1052.939,"Well but it's a requirement that would make it impossible to comply with the Equal Protection Clause if it was faithfully followed, isn't that what you're--"
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,1052.939,1063.997,"--No, not really, because in any July or August the Commissioners' Court would have the authority to do that and the problem is simply one of timing with respect to an upcoming election."
1980.80-180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1082.1,1083.708,--But why July and August?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,1088.502,1110.9,"I suspect, Your Honor, that... I don't know why at the particular time, I suspect that almost any change could run afoul of the primary and general election problems that we have in Texas."
1980.80-180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.587,1153.397,But didn't the primary used to be held at the end of July?
1980.80-180,0,39506,richard_hall,,1153.397,1158.647,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,1787.657,1792.077,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.816,1884.071,"Mr. Parmley, do you think that Wise contemplated, when it spoke of the unwelcome responsibility of federal courts and the legislative responsibility to comply with the one-man-one-vote rule, that it contemplated an action by a Commissioners' Court such as this that was forbidden by state law, if in fact it was forbidden?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,1884.071,1891.803,"Well Your Honor, I don't believe that the Commissioners' Court action in this case was forbidden by state law."
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.803,1897.425,"Suppose it was, then answer Justice Rehnquist's question."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,1897.425,1907.294,Whether or not Wise would have... I'm not sure I understand the question.
1980.80-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.294,1928.131,"Well, suppose that state statute forbade the county court from doing what the District Court asked it to do."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,1951.637,1967.428,I think the District Court was aware that the legislative body had presented a plan that it did not have legislative authority to present; that the District Court should have instructed that legislative body to go back and respond to its duty to present a valid substitute.
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.428,1972.284,"As a party to the lawsuit, but not as a legislative body, couldn't that be?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,1983.172,1991.043,"Well, I guess it's just a question of whether or not the District Court can defer twice to the legislative body."
1980.80-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.426,2016.643,"It's a pretty important question in view of the dicennial census, isn't it?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2055.846,2086.991,"Yes sir, I understand that position, but I believe that legislative history will show that a correct application of Section 5 is that whenever... when the legislative body has received a judicial deferral, to come up and present a substitute plan, when that legislative body has finalized its plan which incorporates public policy objectives and is preparing to submit that plan to the District Court, it is in effect seeking to administer that plan through incorporation in the court's order."
1980.80-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.772,2154.995,"What if the census shows, the 1980 census figures show that this Kleberg County Commissioners' Court is mal-apportioned, then the Commissioners' Court simply sits on its hands and does nothing so that it can't be accused of seeking to institute any new thing that would be required... preclearance under Section 5."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2172.691,2212.143,"Well, I think that the legislative history of Section 5 supports the application which I just told you, that in Fourteenth Amendment cases, where there is a violation that is found by the Court... at the 1975 extension hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report specifically stated that after the invalidation of a plan by the... and legislative deferment the Court should defer its consideration of plans presented to it until such times as these plans have been submitted for Section 5 review."
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.486,2239.257,"Well Mr. Parmley, what if in this case the Commissioners' Court had said judge, we just don't want to come up with a plan and... it's too difficult and we don't think we have the authority and even if we did, we just don't agree with you that the old one is bad, we're going to appeal and meanwhile, the... if you want to put in your own, fine, go ahead."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2262.155,2263.124,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.2,2274.931,"Well what if... what then if the Commissioners' Court just sits on its hands as Justice Rehnquist says, and once the declaratory judgment is issued it just doesn't do anything."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2279.039,2285.036,--Or invite the Plaintiffs to submit plans and that may be an incentive for the legislative body to come up with their own.
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.036,2296.64,"Well it may be, but if they don't, then... and the Court puts in its own plan, then under our... unless we overrule our cases, the Court plan isn't subject to preclearance, is it?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2296.64,2299.437,That's correct.
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.967,2320.193,"So it may be that we're not arguing about much here, in the sense that a Commissioners' Court could just... or any legislative body after a declaration of unconstitutionality of an old plan is just going... it doesn't want to preclear, it just isn't going to submit a plan."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2353.93,2356.116,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.116,2359.193,Though it's not the word he used.
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2359.193,2363.176,Well he said directed but he also said he was... affording them an equal opportunity--
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.176,2367.581,And that... if the defendants didn't comply with the direction they might be in contempt of Court.
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2375.39,2391.711,--Well I think it could order... I think it should order a legislative body to come forward with a plan.
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2391.711,2395.179,"And here it seems to have done so, by use of the word directed."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2410.47,2412.297,That's my understanding.
1980.80-180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.297,2424.745,"Could not the legislative body frustrate even the most mandatory direction by submitting a plan that was, on its face, unacceptable?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2428.009,2439.036,"Yes, Your Honor, but I would say that there would be an incentive not to do that because the Court may adopt the Plaintiffs plan, and I don't think a legislative body would want to have the plaintiff's plan adopted, but--"
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.036,2440.848,Here did the Plaintiffs submit a plan?
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2440.848,2442.832,"--Yes, Your Honor, they did."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2448.735,2455.53,"Of course, part of the Plaintiff's case was the dilution of the votes of the Mexican-American voters, a claim that was rejected by the District Court."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2455.53,2456.795,"Yes sir, that's so."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2456.795,2457.154,Correct?
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2466.822,2470.384,"No, but in our opinion, the Plaintiffs plan tried to correct that."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2470.384,2474.133,"Yes, well that... and that claim was rejected by the District Court."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2474.133,2479.724,"The Court yes, the District Court found there was no dilution in Mexican-American voting strength."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.724,2480.005,Right.
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2482.316,2483.628,That is correct.
1980.80-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.628,2496.841,"Maybe I missed something, but what would be the constitutional objection to a District Court ordering the party to a lawsuit who is found to have violated the law, from proposing a remedy?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2501.105,2509.993,"Well, I believe they could."
1980.80-180,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.972,2531.359,"That is, order them at the pain of contempt, or order them and if they don't do so then the Court does its own?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2531.359,2540.418,"Well I guess they could put them in contempt, if they don't follow an order, it seems to me that the--"
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.418,2544.118,You mean an entire state legislature as in Burns?
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2575.466,2586.946,"--Yes, I think it would impose, probably an interim plan, and possibly request the Defendants to come back with a satisfactory plan,... if that's the legislative body--"
1980.80-180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.946,2594.708,"Well under our cases, it wouldn't necessarily be reversible error if pending a new plan the old plan stayed in use."
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2599.707,2599.972,"--Yes, that's correct."
1980.80-180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2719.174,2723.765,"Leave the copy of that Attorney General's opinion with the Clerk, will you?"
1980.80-180,1,40184,robert_g_parmley,,2723.765,2724.718,Yes sir.
1980.80-180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.718,2738.43,Mr. Wallace.
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2738.43,2744.163,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3099.066,3103.502,"Well, the substantive standards are a little different when you come to multi-member districts, and so on."
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3103.502,3104.205,--That's right.
1980.80-180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.441,3276.151,"Well, Mr. Wallace, what if the Commissioner's Court said that Judge, we just aren't able to come up with a plan and we know you... we disagree with our old one and we're going to appeal, but meanwhile, we can't get together on a plan and don't propose to submit one?"
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3284.554,3288.412,--It would act with whatever other assistance can be made available.

1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3301.781,3303.858,--this Court has prescribed for court-ordered plans.
1980.80-180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.858,3316.9,"--But if a... or a state party to the lawsuit actually responds, then do you think that any kind of a response is subject to preclearance?"
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3316.9,3320.821,"Well, we don't quite say any kind of a response--"
1980.80-180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.821,3332.144,"Suppose... any response that purports to respond to the request, or propose a plan?"
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3332.144,3351.778,"--That proposes a plan, a proposal of a covered jurisdiction to the reapportionment court that this is what we'd like to put into effect as our new apportionment raises the problem that Congress was applying Section 5 to assure protection."
1980.80-180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.778,3367.661,"But you don't think that the responding legislative body has to purport to act legislatively in the sense that it should have a meeting and have a... open to the public, and go through the procedures for the adopting of an ordinance or of an order or not?"
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3374.627,3388.154,Well all of that may be much more desirable as a matter of state practice and state law for them to do it in an open way and in a way that they would ordinarily reapportion themselves.
1980.80-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3439.476,3462.404,"Mr. Wallace, what if you run into the situation where the Commissioners' Court, after the census information is distributed simply sits on its hands and decides it is clear we are malapportioned... but we like it this way, and let them, someone come after us."
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3475.851,3497.25,"Well if the jurisdiction does not respond to the District Court's invitation to them, to submit a proposal that the District Court should put into effect on an interim basis hopefully, until there is actual legislation enacted."
1980.80-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.182,3513.087,And that would require no preclearance?
1980.80-180,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3513.087,3514.712,--That is correct.
1980.80-180,3,39506,richard_hall,,3804.829,3807.22,"I'll speak quickly, Your Honor."
1980.80-180,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3874.786,3877.755,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
