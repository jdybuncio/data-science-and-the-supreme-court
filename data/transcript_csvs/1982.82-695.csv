1982.82-695,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.165,We'll hear arguments next in the Francise Tax Board of California against the Construction Laborers Trust.
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,99.101,102.819,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-695,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.86,114.891,"Could you raise your voice a little, Ms. Kitching."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,114.891,115.625,--Yes.
1982.82-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.117,303.159,"Ms. Kitching, when you say that California relied solely on state law, is that true of your declaratory... prayer for declaratory relief, as well as your prayer that the taxes be... judgment be given?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,303.159,303.878,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.374,315.748,"Well, I realize that statute gave you the procedural vehicle for a declaratory judgment."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,322.197,334.864,We wanted them to honor future levies and we alleged that their defense of preemption as to why they were not honoring our levies was not a valid defense.
1982.82-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.864,344.361,And did... I suppose in that part of your prayer for a declaratory judgment you had to discuss some federal authorities?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,344.361,349.173,"Well, not necessarily in my prayer I didn't discuss--"
1982.82-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.173,354.123,"Not in your prayer, perhaps, and perhaps not in the allegations of your complaint."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,361.621,363.574,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.166,388.581,"Well, I'm trying to... I suppose everybody would concede that if your claim had simply been that, you owe us the taxes because California statute XYZ says you do, give us judgment, that there is no... under the well-pleaded complaint doctrine, there is no raising of a federal question."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,396.483,405.214,"No, I don't believe we do under the authority of this Court, because that's only anticipating what the defense of the Defendant was going to be, which was going to be based on federal law."
1982.82-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.816,442.073,"Well, but didn't the complaint itself, though, refer to the question about whether ERISA preempted the levy and referred to the position on the face of the complaint taken by the trust fund, the trustees?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,442.073,445.244,"--Yes, the complaint set out the position of the trustees."
1982.82-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.688,561.433,"Before we leave jurisdiction, for the Tax Injunction Act to be applicable I suppose we have to determine that there was an adequate state remedy available."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,582.205,592.014,"--Well, it's the position of the Franchise Tax Board that the trustees could have defended in the lawsuit which had been brought against them."
1982.82-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,592.014,594.762,They couldn't have brought an action had they been concerned?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,594.762,595.372,No.
1982.82-695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.02,634.465,"Well, what if the trustees had gone to the federal court in the first place, beat you to the courthouse, and wanted a declaratory judgment that ERISA did preempt your tax scheme?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,637.105,638.871,"No, I don't believe so, because--"
1982.82-695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.871,640.823,Do you think... why not?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,640.823,643.821,--Because of 28 U.S.C. 1341.
1982.82-695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.273,652.177,"But aside from that provision, would there have been federal jurisdiction?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,652.177,660.61,The trustees have argued that ERISA gives them--
1982.82-695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.61,661.422,They go in and--
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,661.422,662.282,--a statutory--
1982.82-695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.282,666.421,"--their claim, their federal claim, is that ERISA preempts."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,675.98,684.82,"--If they can use a statute under ERISA, they probably have jurisdiction in the federal court."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1136.872,1140.089,You feel that that is a precedent for this case?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1140.089,1144.088,"--We feel that we also have a high public purpose, yes, we do."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1146.43,1149.68,"What is a high public service, collection of taxes?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1149.68,1153.928,"--Certainly, Your Honor, the collection of taxes, which are the lifeblood of government."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1153.928,1156.24,"But there are other means of collecting taxes, aren't there?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1156.24,1162.47,"Yes, Your Honor, and the state has the ability to use all of its cumulative remedies."
1982.82-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1182.697,1211.857,"On that point, I suppose that the spouses and dependent children of a beneficiary under the trust fund stand in a special relationship, because they are among the beneficiaries in a sense themselves, the intended beneficiaries of those funds ultimately, unlike perhaps the State of California."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1211.857,1220.166,"The State of California does not have the same purpose, of course, as the ex-spouse and children."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1242.518,1244.265,Do you have withholding in California?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1244.265,1245.718,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1245.718,1248.889,And that was insufficient in these cases?
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1248.889,1252.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1265.586,1272.099,"Well, I ask that because you emphasize the transient character of these workers."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1282.407,1286.03,"Well, in some cases it would, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1300.759,1308.537,"This is just a test case, of course, but the great sum of $308 or something like that?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1308.537,1309.677,"That's right, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1482.779,1491.93,"Of course, if we were to vacate and remand this case on your jurisdictional approach, that doesn't mean you've necessarily won it in state court, does it?"
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1491.93,1493.649,"You're correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1496.664,1499.647,"Actually, you won it at the district court level on the federal side."
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1499.647,1499.85,--Yes.
1982.82-695,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1502.052,1507.003,And you're complaining now because you got tipped over in the Court of Appeals.
1982.82-695,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1507.003,1507.644,"Yes, we are."
1982.82-695,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1514.547,1525.856,Mr. Watson?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1525.856,1529.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.389,1598.966,When did the federal question arise in the case?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1598.966,1605.308,"I think the federal question arose in the case, Your Honor, immediately when the complaint was filed."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.435,1646.744,"Mr. Watson, it is correct, is it not, that the entire prayer of the complaint, the four paragraphs after the ""wherefore"", say nothing at all about anything federal?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1646.744,1648.055,"That is right, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.892,1670.781,Would you not also agree that the reference to the federal claim is in the nature of what the Defendants will assert by way of defense?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1670.781,1679.715,"I would agree that the Board has laid out the federal question and stated that it is the position of the trust that there is a federal preemption, that is true."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.602,1694.177,"But the prayer for relief and what they ask for is not a claim arising under federal law, is it?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1694.177,1702.267,"The declaratory judgment action they have filed is not a federal remedy and their claim is founded on a California statute, that is clear."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.267,1707.327,Could the state have filed this action in the federal court?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1707.327,1708.843,"I believe could have, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.843,1710.858,On what grounds?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1710.858,1714.701,"Well, I believe it raises an issue under Section 301."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.274,1728.492,How does 301 get here?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1728.492,1736.175,"--Well, 301 gets here because 301 provides that there is concurrent jurisdiction in state and federal courts of suits--"
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.175,1738.925,Did the complaint allege anything about 301?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1738.925,1740.189,--It did not mention 301.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.189,1743.579,"Well, I asked could this complaint have been filed in a federal court."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1743.579,1744.157,It could have.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.157,1745.327,Originally?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1745.327,1745.874,It could have.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.874,1748.077,And on what basis?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1748.077,1762.4,"On the basis that the state as a third party under our Ninth Circuit law would have the right, since it asserts a claim arising under this collective bargaining agreement... it says, the trust fund holds assets, the trustees are obligated to give those assets to us--"
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1762.4,1766.116,And you would agree to jurisdiction?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1766.116,1767.616,"--In federal court, yes, we would."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.616,1770.413,"You'd have been in there fighting just like you're fighting now, wouldn't you?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1770.413,1772.973,"Yes, I would, and gladly so."
1982.82-695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1810.739,1826.608,"But the Tax Injunction Act, which Congress also passed, certainly would indicate that the district courts will not enjoin the state tax, and Grace Brethren says that applies to declaratory judgment as well."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1826.608,1831.108,"I was going to get to that later, but let me address that now, since Your Honor brings it up."
1982.82-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.337,1965.349,"Well, Mr. Watson, perhaps Congress thought that tax laws weren't preempted."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,1965.349,1968.739,"That's another possibility, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.284,2113.618,"May I ask, before you get too far away from the jurisdictional question, on the question of an adequate state California remedy, are you telling me that, supposing the state had levied, had a case of mistaken identity, for example, that a person that they said owed them taxes was not really a beneficiary of the trust or something like that... wouldn't the trustees have a remedy in resisting the levy in some state proceeding that would be prompt and efficient?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2113.618,2123.192,"Well, I know of no reported state case that addresses the issue as Your Honor has framed it, but the statute refers to the taxpayer as having the remedy."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.341,2146.088,"Well, let me just be sure I understand your position."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2155.725,2156.866,"Oh, yes, I am."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.38,2168.876,And you don't think there is any declaratory judgment proceeding in California law at all that would enable the trustee to question a levy of this kind?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2168.876,2192.663,"I'm saying... I'm saying to the Court that the specific statutory proceeding which is provided is apparently the exclusive remedy, and I'm quite clear that the Board would take the position that the trust doesn't have the standing to come into court and say, wait a minute, Mr. Zarate doesn't owe this tax, and that in effect it's none of the trust fund's business as long as the trust fund holds assets payable to Mr. Zarate, he being one of the taxpayers in this case."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.663,2196.428,Do you think that the duty of the trustee always would be just to pay over the money?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2196.428,2203.316,"I think the statute is set up in such a way as to require the taxpayer to fight his own battle, and--"
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.316,2207.22,And you think the trustees would just automatically pay over the money in all cases?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2207.22,2209.079,--If it weren't for ERISA--
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.079,2209.782,Yes.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2209.782,2210.844,--and it weren't for the strictures--
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.844,2215.046,"I'm assuming no ERISA problem, just the state law, you know, sort of garden variety defense."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2215.046,2226.978,"--Well, the state law that also limits the recovery rights to the taxpayer also protects, also protects the third party who pays the money over against suit or challenge by the taxpayer."
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.413,2235.021,Thank you.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2235.021,2250.86,"And frankly, if we took just an ordinary third party, as opposed to the trustees, given the protections the statute gives them if they pay the money to the state and given the judicial process the state has to compel it, they would have no reason in the world not to pay the money over."
1982.82-695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2257.967,2269.182,"Mr. Watson, if I understood Ms. Kitching correctly, she suggested that the state remedy was for the trustees to pay it over and then sue for conversion?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2269.182,2271.025,"Yes, and I don't follow that."
1982.82-695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.025,2271.557,Is that the theory?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2271.557,2272.617,I don't follow that.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.045,2419.229,"Mr. Watson, suppose the trust fund didn't pay its property tax."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2422.104,2425.852,If it didn't pay its property tax?
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.852,2429.054,"Yes, sir, on the building it owned."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2429.054,2429.851,Yes.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.392,2443.985,"The only reason it has a defense is... well, let me try."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2454.138,2456.058,"No, I don't think it would, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.6,2471.506,They're trying to take assets of the fund.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2473.567,2475.192,"--Well, they're trying to get property taxes."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.192,2477.441,In both cases they're trying to get money.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2477.441,2477.91,That's true.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.06,2493.637,You couldn't take the property taxes out of that money if there was no other money?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2493.637,2512.645,"--No, it's quite clear to me that the trust as a general debtor itself in the state of California would not have a special position, although the Heffernan case from Connecticut does suggest that direct taxes on the trust fund may be preempted by ERISA, special taxes directed just at trust assets."
1982.82-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.228,2580.383,Differently from pension trusts.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2580.383,2583.305,Differently from pension trusts in the sense that there's less regulation.
1982.82-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.574,2691.135,That doesn't answer the propriety of removal here.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2691.135,2693.165,"That is true, Your Honor, that is true."
1982.82-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.016,2725.824,"Well, I don't suppose there's any doubt that, had the trustees sought to sue, they could have found some basis for federal jurisdiction."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2731.665,2733.977,I think Your Honor is right.
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2768.885,2770.743,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2793.734,2795.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2905.549,2906.018,What is the difference?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2970.133,2971.805,--Well--
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.805,2978.036,Is there any barrier to a creditor levying on the cash value of a life insurance policy in California?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2978.036,2984.001,"--You're talking now not about a life insurance policy under one of these controlled trusts, but just a general life insurance policy."
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2987.876,2991.203,Why should there be a difference because it's in a controlled trust?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,2991.203,3013.958,"Because in this situation the trust is controlled by ERISA and ERISA explicitly in Section 403 limits the way in which the assets can be disbursed, and apparently does that, if I may expand on that, because Congress was concerned in passing ERISA that trust fund benefits were being dissipated in ways which cause the purpose of the trust to be defeated."
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.005,3019.722,"The purpose of the life insurance trust would be defeated, too."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3019.722,3021.55,"--Well, it would."
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.807,3044.586,Would you be making the same argument if all these events occurred after 1982?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3044.586,3047.429,"--Oh, yes, I definitely would."
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.616,3092.942,Do you think the '82 amendment just confirmed the meaning of the prior law?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3092.942,3094.239,"I do, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.797,3108.733,That isn't what it says.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3112.497,3115.403,"That's exactly right, yes."
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.103,3124.773,"So it didn't really change, the '82 amendment--"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3124.773,3125.508,"--It didn't change it, that's exactly right."
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.508,3130.584,--didn't purport to change what the law was or anything of the kind.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3130.584,3131.756,That's exactly right.
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3164.227,3165.086,"It said ""may""."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3166.148,3167.038,"It said ""may""."
1982.82-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.788,3168.21,That's right.
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3168.21,3168.787,That's correct.
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.744,3278.915,"Mr. Watson, let me be sure I understood your answer to my other question."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3283.788,3289.13,The requirement is in Section 502(a)(3) and 502(e) of the Act.
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.13,3290.066,Of ERISA?
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3290.066,3290.863,Of ERISA.
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3344.247,3345.918,"So you're saying... excuse me, go ahead."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3353.963,3358.632,"I'm saying that, regardless of the remedy that the trustee sought--"
1982.82-695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.632,3367.488,"That the absence of the adequate state remedy, if I understand your argument, is because there's a provision in ERISA which preempts what might otherwise be a state remedy?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3367.488,3367.848,--Yes.
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.872,3394.227,"In other words, the state court would have no jurisdiction to pass on your defense?"
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3394.227,3395.368,That's exactly right.
1982.82-695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.085,3413.267,"It's sort of like in antitrust, federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over antitrust cases, and I take it state courts haven't got any jurisdiction."
1982.82-695,1,33487,james_p_watson,,3431.292,3433.525,"Your Honor, I apologize to the Court if there was a defect in the brief."
1982.82-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.525,3440.163,Ms. Kitching.
1982.82-695,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3440.163,3443.286,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1982.82-695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.463,3474.476,"What do you think about 502(a)(3), then?"
1982.82-695,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3474.476,3478.022,"Well, we're not talking about where they're bringing the lawsuit."
1982.82-695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3482.209,3487.097,"You don't think it was Congress' intention, then, to reserve those kinds of considerations for a federal court?"
1982.82-695,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3487.097,3487.862,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.82-695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.359,3495.75,What do you say about the '82 amendment?
1982.82-695,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3495.75,3502.014,We agree that it has not changed anything under ERISA and that whatever was--
1982.82-695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.014,3506.386,"You wouldn't be making this argument, then, after... or would you, after '82?"
1982.82-695,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3506.386,3510.431,--We don't think the statute has changed anything.
1982.82-695,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3555.32,3557.039,"Thank you, counsel."
