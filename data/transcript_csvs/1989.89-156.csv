1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-156, Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. Edward J. Davenport."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,12.141,15.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.975,203.147,"Mr. Cohen, were criminal monetary sanctions considered debts in pre-Code Chapter 13-type proceedings?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,203.147,206.199,"They were not, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.199,209.92,Were they dischargeable?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,209.92,221.126,"The criminal court orders were not... they were dischargeable, but under the definition of debt."
1989.89-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.916,242.391,Are there cases that you cite holding that criminal monetary sanctions were nondischargeable?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,242.391,248.128,"Yes, Your Honor, and In re Moore is one of them."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.645,302.43,"Well, what's the language that's involved here?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,308.933,310.302,Because it is said to be a debt.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.302,311.118,"Well,--"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,311.118,313.487,A debt is defined as a liability on a claim.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.604,322.76,--So why don't we have to... aren't you going to have to tell us what a debt is or isn't?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,322.76,327.378,--A debt is a liability on a claim and claim is a right to payment.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.34,354.397,"And it isn't... it isn't... it's... I suppose he is supposed to pay it, isn't he."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,354.397,355.781,"Your Honor, it is a sentence."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.316,359.749,"Well, he's suppose to pay it, isn't he?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,359.749,363.087,--He is suppose to pay it if he is to follow the sentencing--
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.087,365.287,"And if he doesn't, he'll be in jail."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,365.287,368.789,"--That's correct, if he has the ability to pay it."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.978,375.445,That's right.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,375.445,376.095,We don't have debtor's prisons.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.095,376.545,That's right.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,376.545,379.347,You can't send somebody to jail if they cannot afford to pay it.
1989.89-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.872,401.462,"Well, I suppose if someone qualifies for bankruptcy, that's pretty good evidence that they don't have the ability to pay."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,401.462,426.911,"Yes, Your Honor, but a criminal restitution sentence... and this is specifically in Pennsylvania, but I don't think that we're asking this Court to just hold for Pennsylvania obviously... but specifically in the Pennsylvania statute, a restitution order for welfare fraud can continue even beyond the term of possible sentence for the underlying crime, which in this case was seven years."
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.635,445.824,Does the probation... does the welfare department have a right of setoff against future payments for the nonpayment of the fine?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,445.824,451.895,The department would be able to proceed to recoup if the individuals are still on welfare.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.495,458.882,"Well, that's... that's... that's exercising a right... a right of payment, I take it."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,458.882,466.988,"--It's an exercise of recoupment for the money that was taken, but that is--"
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.988,468.271,"Well, you call it... you call it recoupment."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,468.271,469.939,"--Not under the criminal court order, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.074,480.145,"Well, what do they have to do in order to recoup other than just read the court order?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,480.145,482.08,They have to proceed civilly.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.08,485.216,And how do... how do they do that?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,485.216,490.686,The welfare department does not recoup on the basis of the criminal restitution order.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.07,493.472,How it does it proceed civilly?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,493.472,499.376,--It proceeds by going into court and seeking a civil judgment for the money unlawfully paid.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.026,530.561,So the recoupment can only be after a civil proceeding?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,530.561,532.097,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.097,537.917,I suppose that wouldn't make... make it a debt that was dischargeable.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,537.917,540.703,If it were in a civil proceeding.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.703,541.136,Yes.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,541.136,546.005,If this Court had a civil judgment order in front of it.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.963,594.753,"If you had a state where the welfare department could recoup simply based on the criminal judgment, would the debt be... would the transaction be a debt in those states?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,594.753,606.828,"Your Honor, there are some states that in fact have in the criminal statute a civil process to enact a... to proceed civilly toward a civil judgment."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.536,630.261,"Well, wouldn't... wouldn't you say that this bankrupt owed the... the... is it the state, the city... the... Pennsylvania... is it the state that we are talking about?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,630.261,632.378,The Department of Public Welfare paying out--
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.378,637.014,Didn't the bankruptor owe them some money?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,637.014,639.032,--As a result of the sentence--
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.032,639.899,"No, no, no."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,647.472,648.988,--That's correct.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.988,651.507,And couldn't he have listed that as a debt that he owed to--
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,651.507,653.126,He did do that.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.126,656.078,--He did do that and why isn't that debt dischargeable?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,656.078,659.03,Because that is different from the criminal sentence itself.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.03,662.648,"Well, I know, but isn't that debt dischargeable?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,670.019,688.299,"Oh, because... that process and what the court did here was to actually end up with $120 paid out to the creditors and said that that was one of the debts... one of many debts that was dischargeable."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.155,703.992,But the restitution order... isn't it measured by what the fellow took from somebody else?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,703.992,705.175,It can be.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.175,706.127,Wasn't it here?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,706.127,707.694,And in this case it was.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.411,748.338,I suppose that he could have been convicted for some fraud but he might just have independently paid the money back to the... to the city or to the department of welfare.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,748.338,748.588,To the state.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.588,751.456,He might have done that and still been convicted mightn't he?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,751.456,752.741,That would be possible.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.741,755.943,But there certainly wouldn't be any restitution order.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,755.943,758.426,"That's correct under those circumstances, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.426,762.43,Then why should there be if his debt has been discharged?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,762.43,767.049,The restitution order came before any proceeding in bankruptcy.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.738,775.688,But suppose it didn't.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,780.892,785.796,"I still don't think it matters, Your Honor, because I think that--"
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,785.796,794.734,"Well, the question is does... does the Pennsylvania criminal court have authority to impose the restitution order even if the debt has been discharged."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,794.734,797.52,--It is our position that they do.
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.52,799.92,Restitution for something that he doesn't owe?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,799.92,815.565,Restitution for something that the bankruptcy court has said that he doesn't owe but that the criminal court judge can still say is a violation of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the judgment made by the state legislature.
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.273,860.094,"Mr. Cohen, you say there has to be some... some indication in the statute... clear indication, or whatever terminology you use."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,894.517,894.934,And--
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.934,901.171,"It seems to me clear that Congress thinks that a fine, penalty or forfeiture, criminal though it be, is a debt."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,901.171,919.815,"--Your Honor, in Kelly v. Robinson this Court did act based upon that section of the Bankruptcy Code and acted to uphold the restitution order basically in that Connecticut case."
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.719,927.155,Because it said it did not exclude it.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,927.638,934.975,--It said to the extent that it is a debt it is not dischargeable.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.975,936.427,"Well, they didn't reach the question."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,937.477,938.027,They didn't reach--
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.027,938.511,All right.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,938.511,939.313,"--That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.313,941.196,"Well, I don't care about the question, I'm talking about the text."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,954.306,954.639,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.001,1003.219,I... I... I've heard of a civil penalty in a civil forfeiture.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1017.796,1018.498,That's the case.
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.498,1022.2,--what our statutes happen to be written in.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1042.445,1043.78,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.78,1044.982,You don't think you could?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1044.982,1045.365,Because--
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.365,1046.531,If you went in and said this is a debt--
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1046.531,1046.998,--I think it is a--
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.998,1048.184,--that's owed?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1048.184,1049.217,--it is a sentence to the... to the individual.
1989.89-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.325,1063.027,Is there any case law supporting your position?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1063.027,1063.677,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.327,1065.646,But there is some to the contrary.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1068.212,1074.668,No.
1989.89-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.297,1200.749,xxx preferences?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1200.749,1209.088,"Because it would be within the 90-day period and a preference, a debt, would have to be paid back."
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.623,1213.492,Excise me.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1230.954,1243.927,"--I think, Your Honor, that that is different because a restitution order... well, I guess a fine would still be a sentence."
1989.89-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.217,1257.319,But my... my point is a fine would also be voidable you would say if we accept the--
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1257.319,1263.691,--If you accept the position of the Third Circuit.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.708,1271.412,"--Because there is no contemporary consideration paid for each of the installments, is that why it is voidable?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1271.412,1276.583,"--No, because under what Justice Scalia would be saying--"
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.583,1278.185,"Well, I can ask him in conference."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1278.185,1278.918,--it was a debt.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.918,1279.551,I'm asking you now.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1280.285,1281.72,It was... it is a debt.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.086,1286.771,"Well, but it's not all debts that are preferences."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1296.946,1303.383,That's correct and it's money that otherwise should be available to all of the creditors in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.887,1371.627,"As a matter of fact, Mr. Cohen, in Pennsylvania is restitution often imposed as the only criminal sanction or is it usually accompanied by a fine or a... or a criminal sentence?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1371.627,1389.422,"In this case, for example, Your Honor, it was a condition of probation imposed along with court costs so that court costs were separate from the restitution order which was a condition of the probation sentence of one year."
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.533,1420.71,"Do you think if... if the Third Circuit view prevails, the Pennsylvania criminal court would have difficulty revoking probation for failure to pay the restitution?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1420.71,1421.793,--It would have difficulty.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1440.541,1454.264,"Well, why... why would ability to pay be critical in deciding whether or not because the... it's dischargeable in bankruptcy, you could nonetheless revoke probation for failure to pay it?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1454.264,1465.072,"--Because you can't... under Bearden v. Georgia, state court or federal court cannot revoke probation without making that determination of the ability of the defendant--"
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.072,1465.739,"Well, okay."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1471.976,1473.012,--That's correct.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.012,1486.252,"Well, supposing there was a determination that the defendant did have the ability to pay, but nonetheless the Third Circuit's view is upheld here and we say this is a debt dischargeable in bankruptcy."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1492.489,1497.21,"No, I don't think under those circumstances."
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.21,1497.493,Can you--
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1497.493,1505.281,But I think that what that then does in the future is set up a system where people convicted of welfare fraud would go to prison.
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.281,1517.291,"--Well, why is that if... if the defendant wishes to avoid incarceration and he can come up with the money to pay, he just pays it despite the fact there's been a discharge."
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1517.291,1517.757,I thought the--
1989.89-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1517.757,1518.841,He has his choice.
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1522.176,1526.312,"--If he wants to rely on the discharge, he goes to jail."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.038,1573.008,"--If this restitution order is considered a debt, do you lose?"
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1573.008,1574.293,We lose this case.
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.293,1582.131,There is no way of saying that the... that the restitution order is not dischargeable under the provisions of the Code?
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1582.131,1591.255,"No, not at all, because the 523(a)(7) applies to Chapter 7 but not to Chapter 13 bankruptcies under Section 1328(a)."
1989.89-156,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.743,1608.883,But by the same token then you say you shouldn't use (a)(7) to show that this is a debt because this--
1989.89-156,0,44189,walter_w_cohen,,1608.883,1610.05,I... I would say that.
1989.89-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.468,1616.087,"--Yes, you may, Mr. Cohen."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1618.406,1619.606,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.606,1634.082,"Mr. Searles, if the Third Circuit view is upheld here, do you think that a Pennsylvania criminal court could revoke this particular Respondents' probation for failure to make the restitution payment?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1634.082,1641.938,"Your Honor, I think it depends whether the restitution order is an independent component of the criminal sentence or whether it's a condition of probation."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.945,1688.051,But you wouldn't see the federal Bankruptcy Code as a bar to revocation of probation in the latter situation.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1688.051,1695.072,It would be a bar insofar as in an attempt to collect money that had been discharged... a debt that had been discharged.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.847,1712.534,I'm... I'm not sure I understand your answer because the first part sort of read out the last part.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1726.961,1727.594,I think what--
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.594,1729.995,Do you consider that an attempt to collect a debt?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1737.649,1738.133,--I think that--
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.133,1741.887,"If state law provides that, is it allowable under federal law?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1741.887,1743.787,--I think that 524 would bar that.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.787,1744.453,Okay.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1744.453,1748.874,That's... court... the Congress' statutory injunction against collection of a discharged debt.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.051,1768.288,"Well, but are... you know, the last clause is almost meaningless so far as I can tell."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1781.928,1784.814,"That would be the defense, that federal law precludes collection of the debt."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.814,1789.534,"Well, does the state court have any option if the federal defense is a good one?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1796.055,1798.557,I believe that's true.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.557,1804.961,"Mr. Searles, before you get into your argument, could you help me out on one... this is not a bankruptcy, this is a Chapter 13, isn't it?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1804.961,1805.411,"Yes, it is."
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.411,1806.544,It reads more like a reorganization.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1806.544,1807.113,Yes.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.113,1816.268,"Now, what is the difference between the... your client's obligation under the plan of... whatever the plan he had was, and his obligation had there been no plan?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1818.553,1819.803,Yes.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.803,1820.37,"Yeah, well, what--"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1820.37,1832.611,What a debtor in a Chapter 13 does is... is sets forth what his disposable income is and proposes that be paid to the trustee on a periodic basis and the trustee takes that money and pays it to the various creditors who have filed claims.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.611,1835.08,"--Well, why d... why doesn't the state get paid in full in this case?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1835.08,1837.949,They did not file a claim.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.949,1840.067,"But if they had filed a claim, wouldn't they have been paid in full?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1840.067,1841.101,They would not have been paid in full.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.503,1843.869,I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1843.869,1846.721,--based on the bankruptcy judge's determination of what he could afford.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.721,1856.493,"But if, for example, this was the only debt he had... or assuming its a debt for... I don't suppose they would approve of the plan if... if it was just a means to get rid of this one obligation, would they?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1859.797,1870.503,"Well, I think bankruptcy courts have... have the power to dismiss bankruptcies or deny confirmation of bankruptcy plans if they feel, based on all the circumstances that exist--"
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.503,1871.303,Isn't there a good faith requirement?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1871.303,1871.688,--that it's not a proper--
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.688,1872.438,Isn't there a good faith requirement?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1872.438,1874.222,--that doesn't meet the good faith requirement.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.576,1883.663,What percentage of payment did this plan call for?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1883.663,1884.796,--This called for a very low percentage.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.813,1886.615,10 percent?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1886.615,1888.065,It may have been lower than 10 percent.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.065,1888.682,I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1888.682,1892.451,The Davenport's only income was Social Security disability benefits.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.957,1908.711,"Well, if his... if his filings were correct... I'm sorry I shouldn't... if his filings were correct, he really wouldn't have been able to pay this money anyway then, would he?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1908.711,1909.695,After the bankruptcy?
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.695,1910.063,On the schedule.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1910.063,1911.13,"After the bankruptcy, he would not have been able to pay."
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.13,1911.48,Yeah.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1911.48,1912.28,"In fact, that's what happened."
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.88,1946.903,"Can you... can you explain to me why... why you... you say that 523(a)(7) does mean when it says fine, penalty or forfeiture... under your theory it means both civil and criminal."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1947.32,1947.953,--That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.953,1954.926,Why... why... why did Congress not apply that to Chapter 13?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,1956.226,1973.72,"I think it has to do with the purposes of Chapter 13, which is, instead of liquidating your property and distributing the non-exempt assets to your creditors, which is what you do in 7, a 13 is a means to keep property and pay your creditors to the extent that you are able to."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.849,2022.403,Criminal fines would be discharged?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2022.403,2023.936,That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.936,2032.676,What are... what are the advantages for a debtor of taking Chapter 7 over Chapter 13?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2032.676,2049.721,"A debtor who perhaps didn't have... couldn't meet the eligibility requirements of Chapter 13, who didn't have regular income, or who had more debts than he can have under Chapter 13, might be forced to liquidate rather than to reorganize."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.721,2057.659,"But I take it the requirement for regular income is not terribly demanding under Chapter 13, if Social Security alone is enough."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2057.659,2059.043,It has to be regular.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.931,2071.301,But it would be enough... I take it it was deemed enough in this case to pay 10 percent?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2071.301,2074.668,"It was deemed enough... I'm not sure what the percentage was, but yes, it was deemed enough."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.119,2133.708,"When he... when the... the 13... Chapter 13 proceeding was filed, he did list his debt to the Department, didn't he?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2133.708,2135.91,"Yes, he did."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.91,2137.695,But the Department never filed a claim.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2137.695,2138.345,That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.969,2268.18,"But... as between the pre-Code situation and the post-Code situation, the state and the restitution victim I take it would prefer the pre-Code situation were... it was not... it was not includible or allowable, but is also dischargeable."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2270.198,2270.515,That is right.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.15,2273.534,Yeah.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2273.534,2280.304,But what Congress has said now is that these are claims that are to be paid through the distribution of the bankruptcy estate.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.304,2283.606,"Yeah, you may well be right as to that's what Congress has said."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2291.279,2298.866,"Well, but this time... this time they get paid to the extent that there is an estate that has assets in it."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.866,2301.301,Which would be in this particular case 10 percent?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2301.301,2302.217,Or--
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.217,2302.669,Less?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2302.669,2304.503,--Whatever it was.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.407,2309.74,Yes.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2323.5,2330.071,"Well, I think it represents Congress' intent that all creditors share equally."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.327,2374.1,"Was there a great deal of conflict during the 80 years of the previous regime, from 1898 to 1978?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2374.1,2387.84,"I'm not aware of any cases discusses that, but it appears to me that there could have been conflict because the debtor's estate was being distributed without the holder of the penalty or forfeiture claim getting any money--"
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.325,2490.391,What is the limit?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2490.391,2493.343,"It's $100,000 of unsecured debt."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.376,2551.446,I take it they're not about to get paid what they are entitled to.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2551.446,2553.898,"--They are not going to be paid... in this case, it depends--"
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.898,2556.564,They're not being paid in full.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2556.564,2563.587,"--Well, if they felt that was a valid objection, they could come to court and make it and it would be up to the judge to decide whether the plan comported with the code."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.587,2571.508,All you mean is that they are entitled to... they're entitled to be paid whatever the plans calls them... calls for them to get paid.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2571.508,2574.06,Assuming the plan is a confirmable plan.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.106,2630.898,"Well, I take it... I take it there are quite a number of states filed in this case amicus who don't think your position is very beneficial to them."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2630.898,2634.766,I think that results from their misunderstanding of the nature of Chapter 13.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.766,2638.218,"You mean all these states, they don't know a thing about bankruptcy?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2638.218,2646.258,"They may know something, Your Honor, but I don't believe they understand the purpose of Chapter 13, and the rights that they have in Chapter 13."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.793,2661.917,"Well, I think that they... they must think that if their restitution order is not dischargeable, it can... it can be used to collect this money for over... for years."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2661.917,2663.952,--I think that's what they... that's true.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.312,2689.151,"Yeah, but then the answer to Justice White's question isn't that the states are mistaken, but the states are not mistaken, but Congress has chosen to another concern rather than the one they have--"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2689.151,2694.739,"There are some cases where there is a conflict and that's right, Congress has expressed its concern."
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.34,2698.007,"--Well, it hasn't just expressed its concern."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2700.058,2701.192,--That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.192,2702.744,Which the states don't like very well.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2702.744,2712.183,"But I think if the states understood the nature of Chapter 13 and their rights there to compel the debtor to pay as much as they can, the states wouldn't object as vociferously."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.183,2717.004,You mean they're going to be... they're going to be... get as much as they can this way anyway.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2717.004,2721.639,In many Chapter 13s they would be paid as much as they would get absent the bankruptcy.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.508,2730.912,"Yes, but there is a big difference it seems to me, because if in many of these cases the only substantial debt is the one for restitution or something like that,--"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2730.912,2732.947,I'm not sure that that's the case.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.023,2748.306,--I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2748.306,2750.225,--that was included in their... in their statement.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.133,2763.901,I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2774.007,2775.124,If the states went to court?
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.124,2778.126,"No, if the states win in this... in this case."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2788.633,2789.183,That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.183,2790.968,But you say that that really is not the fact.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2795.77,2806.328,The vast majority of consumer Chapter 13 plans are designed to... to prevent foreclosure of homes primarily because it's... it's something that really wasn't available prior to Chapter 13.
1989.89-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2806.328,2806.712,I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2806.712,2815.001,"Because you stop foreclosure, pay the arrears at the rate that you can afford and then pick up your payments and life goes on."
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.001,2824.873,"Well, all the horrible results that you say would ensue if we agreed with the states that conflict between state collection and federal law."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2836.53,2842.184,"Well, a Chapter 7 isn't designed to help a debtor maintain his home."
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.001,2850.539,"Well, that may well be, but you're still going to have conflict between the... between, you know, the federal policy and the--"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2850.539,2863.697,"--Well, in a Chapter 7, if there's assets to be distributed, it's going to be done through the bankruptcy court and the parties, such as Petitioners, who have claims for these kinds of obligations must share in the distribution."
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2863.697,2864.614,"--Yeah, but what does the state do?"
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2867.216,2870.518,"Absent the bankruptcy, in some cases the state may not be able to have it all."
1989.89-156,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.386,2876.655,"Well, the claims under 7 aren't going to be dischargeable."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2876.655,2877.274,That's correct.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.04,2880.976,"Well, I know they would pass through."
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2891.081,2898.937,"Well, in a Chapter 7, the state would get what it's entitled to under the priority sections of the Code, but the debt would pass through--"
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.937,2899.453,--I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2900.02,2902.472,--and the state would still have the ability to--
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.472,2906.959,The priority section... the priority section does cover.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2906.959,2907.226,--Yes.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.143,2908.659,I see.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2909.159,2910.011,They have 726(a)(4).
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.378,2910.811,They're approvable?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2910.811,2911.428,--Yes.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.428,2913.294,They're approvable as debts?
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2913.294,2913.63,Yes.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.246,2914.713,Allowable.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2915.013,2915.713,Before they were not allowable.
1989.89-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.282,2916.565,Yeah.
1989.89-156,1,21529,david_a_searles,,2916.565,2917.248,Now they can.
1989.89-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.25,3049.802,"Thank you, Mr. Searles."
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3054.92,3069.782,Let me just call the Court's attention to the Joint Appendix page 14a and 15a which sets forth the plan to indicate that the payment in this case was 1 percent to the creditors and not even 10 percent.
1989.89-156,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3071.115,3076.519,Did the state file any claim here--
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3076.519,3077.152,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-156,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3077.152,3078.219,--for the underlying obligation?
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3078.219,3103.503,"No, the claim was listed in the plan, but the state... and I think that that indicates the state prosecutors have a order of a court and we believe it would be unseemly for the prosecutor to have to go in to enforce a criminal court judge's sentence in bankruptcy court."
1989.89-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.503,3116.727,"The debt is listed and if you're right, your debt wouldn't be dischargeable, but meanwhile you could get your 1 percent if you filed a claim."
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3116.727,3119.113,"That's only 1 percent, Your Honor, of a judge's--"
1989.89-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.113,3119.813,"Well, it might be--"
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3119.813,3119.965,--order on the--
1989.89-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.965,3120.398,--20 the next time.
1989.89-156,2,44189,walter_w_cohen,,3120.398,3124.0,--of a commission of a crime.
1989.89-156,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.0,3125.067,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
