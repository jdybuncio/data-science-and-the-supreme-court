1994.93-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.668,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-404, Arthur L.... do you know how your client's full name... is it Gustafson, or Gustafson?"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,13.668,13.918,Gustafson.
1994.93-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.918,18.478,"Arthur L. Gustafson v. Alloyd Company, Incorporated."
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,19.571,25.131,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.617,264.035,"If it had been an offering circular... not just a purchase agreement, but would an offering circular fit within the definition of section 2(10)?"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,264.035,269.641,"An offering circular would certainly be a circular, I think, within the meaning of section 2(10)."
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.193,303.503,"But if it's in connection with a private offering, it would not... is that what you're saying would not?"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,303.503,313.748,"We don't believe that would be the proper definition under 2(10), or, particularly, under section 2(12), given the context of 2(12) as a liability provision in the act."
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.748,318.886,"But 2(10) just says, offers any security for sale."
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,324.823,327.976,The very first word that section 2(10) uses is prospectus.
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.671,353.388,Where is that limitation used?
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,363.744,373.256,"We don't believe so, not for section 2(10) purposes, and certainly not for section 12(2) purposes, because of their use of the word prospectus, used as a selling document."
1994.93-404,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.256,376.63,"And you're... when you say similar import, you mean public offering import?"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,376.63,377.988,"Public offering, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.988,400.806,"So if this deal has... no, it would still be... well, if this deal had been done with the company, the control company issuing new shares, and then Gustafson redeeming the shares that they had originally, then that... otherwise everything is the same."
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,403.212,405.899,If Alloyd had issued new shares to--
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.899,406.93,To the--
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,406.93,408.569,--The buyers?
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.569,408.85,--Yes.
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,415.129,425.219,"As to the first portion of the transaction, the issuance by Alloyd of new shares to the buyers, the exemption of section, I think it's 4(2) of the act, would exempt that transaction."
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.976,453.613,"--But then you would have to make your distinction turn on the actions of a public offering, not on the sale versus resale."
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,455.097,455.753,--There--
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.753,468.233,"--I gave you a situation where you end up with the same result, but in one case it's done in the form of a sale of new shares, redemption of old shares, in the other it's done in the form of just a direct sale of the--"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,468.233,483.632,"--There is some authority, particularly in the comments of legislators, and I think these are cited in the SIA's brief in particular, for the proposition that the act just does not apply to transactions in old stock, period."
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.601,524.304,"--Yes, but I'm giving you two ways of doing essentially the same deal."
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,539.001,544.155,--Some Congressmen so stated when they were debating the act.
1994.93-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.155,545.171,But that's not your position?
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,545.171,549.34,That is part of our position.
1994.93-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.649,556.274,"Yes, but you--"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,559.929,560.164,I--
1994.93-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.164,562.195,--and that is enough to interrupt the act that way?
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,562.195,562.57,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.592,585.7,"As I understand it, you don't rely at all on the distinction between a sale and a resale, do you?"
1994.93-404,0,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,589.699,591.635,--That is the primary position we take.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1529.009,1534.85,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.949,1578.191,"Mr. Kopecky, in 2(10), after it says, the term prospectus means any prospectus, et cetera, et cetera, which offers any security for sale, now, would you say that an, simply an agreement of sale signed by both parties is always something which offers a security for sale?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1578.191,1581.596,"I'm not sure an agreement, per se, would always offer a security for sale."
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.797,1585.765,Why is that?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1585.765,1588.234,"Well, the agreement here was the culmination of a long process."
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.228,1608.023,"So if there had been no representations in the agreement, then perhaps it would not be a prospectus?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1608.023,1609.756,I think perhaps it would not be.
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.032,1628.812,But take a very simple agreement in which the seller represents that he or she is the owner of the stock.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1638.916,1643.181,"In my view, it would, because in that case there would be a representation being made about the security."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.181,1646.429,"So you could, have very simple transactions would be covered by this."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1646.429,1647.819,It is conceivable that--
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.819,1649.709,"And it could be true, just five shares of stock."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1649.709,1653.706,"--Of course, you would have to prove that the person who made that statement was negligent."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.706,1653.941,Sure.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1655.05,1655.3,Right.
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.3,1657.393,"--that, he in fact didn't own three of the shares or something like that."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1657.393,1657.643,Correct.
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.252,1659.657,"But that would be Federal jurisdiction, to resolve that."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1659.657,1661.236,If you use the jurisdictional means--
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.236,1661.47,Right.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1662.407,1662.719,--I would agree--
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1662.719,1663.094,--Excuse me.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1666.483,1667.499,"--It is, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.198,1677.463,So it's affirmative.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1677.463,1683.554,But it is commonly referred to as a negligencebased liability.
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.554,1695.518,"Mr. Kopecky, if your interpretation of the statute prevails, wouldn't it virtually swallow up any 10(b)-5 causes of action?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1695.518,1696.236,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1736.643,1757.338,"But where a 10(b)-5 action would also lie, or a plaintiff such as you represent, your preferred route would be section 12(2) I assume because of its attorneys' fees and lesser requirements for proof."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1757.338,1761.696,"The attorneys' fees would be hard for the plaintiff to get in this case, so I don't think that's a motivating factor."
1994.93-404,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.2,1797.884,"I was going to say, what is your answer to the question why the drafters didn't simply use the word, statement, in place of prospectus, or oral communication?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1797.884,1804.693,"The answer to that question is not clear from the legislative history, so I can only speculate, but let me offer a couple of explanations."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.641,1864.169,"Under the British Companies Act, would there be a remedy such as this, for this transaction?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1864.169,1876.085,"Under the British Companies Act... well, certainly if we were relying on a prospectus I think we'd have a hard time, because the British Companies Act defines prospectus to include a public offering, so I think we would have a harder case."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.88,1886.942,Has this issue been litigated over in--
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1886.942,1888.847,"Your Honor, I confess I have not studied that."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.847,1890.377,"--Well, you brought up the British Companies Act."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1890.377,1891.096,A fair--
1994.93-404,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1891.096,1891.659,All right.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1902.435,1910.275,--I think it is far from clear that brokerage research reports would be subject to liability under section 12(2) for a couple of reasons.
1994.93-404,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.379,1973.408,Why do you say that prospectus is defined as a document that offers or confirms the sale of a security?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1986.386,1991.712,That offers... any of those that offers--
1994.93-404,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.712,1991.977,--I see.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1991.977,1992.79,--any security for sale--
1994.93-404,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.79,1993.431,"I see, which offers--"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1993.431,1993.727,--Right.
1994.93-404,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.727,1994.57,--Which offers any security for sale.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,1994.57,1994.945,Right.
1994.93-404,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.052,2033.836,"That's... although my thought favored you, I hope you'll disabuse me of it if it's not correct, as I'll just get mixed up if it is, but I thought the reason they used the word prospectus instead of any written communication is because they wanted to pick up that particular definition with its limitations, and the limitations are two you just mentioned, plus the fact that a written prospectus, a written communication is not a prospectus if a registration statement has been filed previously and certain things have been done."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2033.836,2034.258,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.258,2035.818,And they wanted to build that all in--
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2035.818,2036.334,I--
1994.93-404,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.334,2038.178,--which the word written communication couldn't have done.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2039.724,2040.552,"--I agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.552,2040.88,Fine.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2046.519,2051.875,"Again, the legislative history doesn't enlighten us much on why they used oral communication."
1994.93-404,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.991,2078.864,"That cuts off my thought, because I can't get it to work with oral communication."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2078.864,2094.607,"I understand, and I'm not sure the logic of all that hangs together, and there's been a lot of question raised about exactly what the freewriting exemption is meant to accomplish and why it was there, so I can't answer how the oral communication precisely fits into that exception from the definition of prospectus."
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.607,2098.935,"A prospectus has to be related to the registration statement, doesn't it?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2098.935,2099.372,No.
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2099.372,2101.543,I thought section 10 required that.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2101.543,2108.635,Section 10 requires what has to be in a prospectus that is issued in conjunction with a registered offering of securities.
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2130.453,2143.541,"But section 10 doesn't say, some prospectuses, it says all, so I had thought, unless--"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2143.541,2143.995,I think where that--
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.995,2145.12,--qualifications.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2145.12,2146.947,"--I think that comes out of section 5, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.928,2162.144,"So then you can limit the term, prospectus, in section 10 at least by reference to other provisions of the act."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2162.144,2165.221,"--I believe... I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.437,2180.387,Are punitive damages available in this sort of a cause of action?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2180.387,2182.012,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.012,2183.557,Why not?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2183.557,2186.603,I'm not aware of any case that has upheld punitive damages.
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.603,2192.257,Are punitive damages available under a 10(b)-5 action?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2192.257,2199.364,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.575,2269.085,"Does... Justice Breyer asked you whether one aspect of the definition of prospectus is carried over into the phrase, oral communication."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2291.857,2296.902,"I believe it is, Your Honor, by the bymeansof language in section 12(2)."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.091,2414.308,Are you suggesting that one of the major purposes Congress had in mind was to eliminate the statute of frauds from these transactions?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2414.308,2415.808,"I don't think that was a major purpose, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.808,2416.089,"I don't, either."
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2416.089,2419.057,I think the major purpose Congress had in mind was--
1994.93-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.057,2422.728,It surely wasn't primarily concerned with oral communications.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2422.728,2424.367,"--I don't disagree with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2451.919,2474.675,"Is it fair to say, though, that the 1933 Securities Act was really an act that concerned initial public offerings, and that the '34 act generally addressed private and secondary trading?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2474.675,2476.705,I think as a--
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.705,2479.017,"I mean, isn't that the general thrust?"
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2479.017,2482.811,"--As a generality, I think that's correct, Your Honor, but I'd like to respond to that in a couple of ways."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.811,2489.496,And so this interpretation of 12(2) doesn't fit exactly with that general thrust.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2489.496,2494.604,If you're going to limit the statute by the primary purpose I think one could make that argument.
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2506.99,2509.535,Could you have brought a 10(b)-5 action?
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2509.535,2512.019,"In theory, we could."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2512.019,2512.331,Yes.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2512.331,2521.827,"The reason we didn't allege it is because we felt we didn't have a Rule 11 basis for asserting fraud, scienter, and so we brought the cause of action we felt the facts supported."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2547.895,2548.645,A good example.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2548.645,2563.591,"And this Court has said, we're going to construe RICO not in light of what was the primary motivation, but the way Congress wrote the statute, and I suggest that's what the Court should do here with section 12(2), is construe the statute the way Congress wrote it."
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2563.591,2569.886,And put us in the same boat we are with all those unpleasant RICO cases.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2569.886,2570.37,Your Honor--
1994.93-404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2612.196,2620.256,Maybe that's because of our more recent holding here as to the scienter requirement under 10(b)-5.
1994.93-404,1,39668,robert_j_kopecky,,2620.256,2620.569,Perhaps.
1994.93-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.647,2659.865,"Thank you, Mr. Kopecky."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2661.209,2669.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-404,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2740.473,2755.061,"Mr. Dreeben, how do you answer Justice Kennedy's question about section 10, which uses the word, a prospectus, but that is definitely the kind of prospectus that would be part of a registration statement?"
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2760.261,2763.275,"Well, for most of section 10, that is true."
1994.93-404,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2827.797,2836.465,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, speaking of distinctions, what would you do about research reports that brokers commonly use in the sale of securities?"
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2836.465,2839.76,"--There is no one, unqualified answer to that, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-404,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2847.492,2850.913,Broadly speaking how could it not be?
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2858.347,2870.202,"--Well, I think in that context, Justice O'Connor, a research report would be the kind of document that's picked up by the language, and the application of section 2, 12(2) would be justified in light of the cause of action."
1994.93-404,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2870.202,2872.388,So all research reports sent out by brokers are prospecti?
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2872.388,2880.073,"To the extent that they are used in a situation that one can conclude, Justice Kennedy, that they are offering a security for sale."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.073,2887.007,Does that mean they have the same high standard of full disclosure that the prospectus that accompanies the normal public offering has?
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2887.007,2896.362,"No, Justice Stevens, they don't, because the requirement that would attach under 12(2) is not a requirement of affirmative disclosure."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.842,2913.653,"Well, that's the same standard under the prospectus."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2913.653,2927.46,"Well, but the question that I thought you were asking, Justice Stevens, is whether there was a laundry list of things that had to be included in a research report analogous to the kinds of things that are required to be included in a registered public offering."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.46,2930.942,"Not by... itemized, but it has the same standard, same high standard of care."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2930.942,2934.972,"Well, it would have a... it would have the same standard of care under section 12(2)."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.891,2941.282,Right.
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2941.282,2946.749,"--misstatements, and the persons who signed the registration statement would also have a very high duty of care."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.749,2951.451,"May I ask, since I interrupted you, do you know the answer to my question about the British Companies Act?"
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2952.873,2956.169,The British Companies Act only applies to initial public offerings.
1994.93-404,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3001.182,3007.352,"Mr. Dreeben, do we owe any deference to the SEC interpretation of these sections?"
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3007.352,3011.193,"Not in the sense of Chevron, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-404,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.006,3053.239,"Well, that would just affect the distinction between initial and secondary, not necessarily between public and private."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3053.239,3082.289,"That is true, but the... in addition to the interpretations by the Federal Trade Commission there were also a raft of articles that were written at the time, or around the time, by such people as William O. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter... Felix Frankfurter was at the time very heavily involved in the drafting process... and those articles asserted without qualification that section 12(2) applied to any sale of securities and wanted to educate the investment community that was concerned with this that that was true."
1994.93-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.631,3129.239,"The one question that prompts us, how do you account for the fact there have been so very few cases like this?"
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3129.239,3160.055,"--Well, I... the... probably the principal explanation in years up until the late 1980's was the existence of Rule 10(b)-5 and causes of action under it, which had really swamped the area, and so litigation under 12(2) certainly did increase as the statute of limitations for Rule 10(b)-5 was held to be shorter and scienter requirements were imposed, but it is a very significant point, Justice Stevens, that Rule 10(b)-5 did not exist when the '34 acts were enacted."
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3160.055,3162.506,Can I ask you a quick question about the research reports?
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3162.506,3162.74,Sure.
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.74,3170.565,"A research report is this, would perhaps be, you offer something for sale, you include a research report, it would be picked up."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3170.565,3171.284,Yes.
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.284,3180.843,But I take it you could get out of that if in fact you had enclosed as well a prospectus that had met the SEC's registration requirement because of the exception in (a).
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3182.077,3186.326,That question has not been definitively decided in the courts.
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.999,3223.139,"Because it's oral, freewriting oral."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3227.34,3227.825,--That is true.
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3229.324,3231.87,Is there any reason (a) and (b) don't apply?
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3231.87,3233.792,--The reason is--
1994.93-404,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.792,3235.275,To a written... to a written.
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3235.275,3248.893,"--The reason is that the result would be that you would have a free zone for fraud or misstatements so long as you provided a copy of the written prospectus, and commentators have viewed that as an implausible result and one that is contrary to the direct evidence of legislative intent."
1994.93-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.893,3250.174,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1994.93-404,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3250.174,3250.612,Thank you.
1994.93-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.612,3253.127,"Mr. Jenkins, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1994.93-404,3,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,3253.127,3277.79,"The fundamental issue here is whether, when everybody says the '33 act was following the British act, which only applied to public offerings, did Congress somehow in the process, by section 12(2), totally convert the '33 act to apply to all private communications in all privately negotiated contexts?"
1994.93-404,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.123,3303.497,What do you say about commentators named Frankfurter and Douglas?
1994.93-404,3,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,3303.497,3319.241,"Mr. Frankfurter was involved in the drafting of the act but not as heavily as Mr. Landis, I think, if you believe what Mr. Landis wrote, which may be a stretch, I don't know, but it appears accurate that Mr. Frankfurter was overseeing it but was not as heavily drafted."
1994.93-404,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3339.795,3347.261,--the British act which did include an express limitation to public offerings?
1994.93-404,3,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,3347.261,3350.9,"--I think the simple answer is, they felt it wasn't necessary."
1994.93-404,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3361.848,3379.778,"You rely on using the same litany of prospectus, notice, circular, et cetera, but then say, well, it's all right for them to have skipped out the other part, that they didn't copy the British wording to that extent."
1994.93-404,3,21051,donald_w_jenkins,,3379.778,3393.601,"That's correct, they did not follow the phrase, include the phrase, to the public, which is in the British Companies Act, but Congress repeatedly said, the draftsmen said, this act is the British securities act."
1994.93-404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3452.155,3453.077,"Thank you, Mr. Jenkins."
