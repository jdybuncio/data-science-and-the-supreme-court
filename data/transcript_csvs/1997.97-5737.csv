1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.336,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-5737, Sandra Forney v. Kenneth Apfel."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,50.175,54.097,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,153.912,159.215,"Well, is it your position that they could not appeal after the result of the remand?"
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,159.215,161.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that is exactly my position."
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.133,172.654,Suppose we think you're wrong about that.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,204.366,213.311,"Justice Ginsburg, yes, that is absolutely correct as far as ordinary civil procedure as it applies to interlocutory orders of remand."
1997.97-5737,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.198,222.939,"Well, it actually doesn't quite do that."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,235.919,236.516,--Yes.
1997.97-5737,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.516,241.41,But with reference to appeal it's subject to the same rule as any other judgment.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,248.814,251.937,"Yes, that's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.538,272.21,"But Mr. Wilborn, Finkelstein could have been a now or never, as the Court pointed out."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,287.882,296.345,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, and we believe we are in a similarly situated profile here."
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.501,329.148,"That I don't understand, because if the court says, Secretary, remodify and remand, that's a marching order for the Secretary."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,335.903,337.035,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,355.318,361.721,"Yes, but if, being faithful to what the court says, it comes out that the claimant wins, then the Secretary is stuck and can't appeal."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,361.721,366.106,"--That's the possibility, and I believe that's why we have a similar situation here."
1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.726,373.94,Why is it that you think you cannot appeal from an adverse decision after the remand?
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,373.94,397.256,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the reason we believe we cannot appeal from an adverse decision following remand is because this section, 405(g), sentence 1, which grants jurisdiction to the district court to review the final judgment of the Secretary, or the Commissioner now, expressly limits the subsequent review in light of Finkelstein saying, this civil action, the judgment, the sentence 4 judgment terminates the civil action."
1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.881,423.554,"That's by no means self-evident, at least to me from the statute."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,471.97,477.042,"Justice Souter, I think if I answer your question, I will also answer Mr. Chief Justice's question."
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.042,477.703,"That's what I think, too."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,477.703,483.637,"So if we take... take as an example the case we have before us, Forney."
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,494.954,495.485,Right.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,495.485,497.988,From a legal... based upon the law of the circuit.
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,509.616,510.376,It's a new action--
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,510.376,511.267,--It is a new action.
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,511.267,511.457,--Okay.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,511.457,513.467,So the current civil action terminates.
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.6,561.258,"Okay, but is the reason that the old decision is not then also still subject to review a timing question, that the time for taking the appeal on the first one has simply run so that we can't think of it as just sort of sitting out there in abeyance?"
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,562.68,564.301,"--I don't believe that is the reason, Justice Souter."
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.332,582.914,"Okay, but it's Finkelstein that says definitively this is a final action."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,582.914,583.125,Yes.
1997.97-5737,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.125,588.977,"So basically your argument comes down... I think comes down to the fact, look, you, Supreme Court, decided Finkelstein."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,596.834,597.645,That's absolutely correct.
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.645,597.825,"Yes, okay."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,608.934,612.296,That is how I understand the Government's position as well--
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.296,612.765,That is not your position.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,612.765,613.586,--Justice Scalia.
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.586,618.04,"From what you've just said, I gather it's now or never."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,618.04,629.067,"That is under the current state of the law, because under sentence 8 it says that our judgment is appealable, as in any other civil action, and in any other civil action if we don't appeal--"
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.067,629.909,You lose it.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,629.909,630.69,--collateral estoppel does come into play.
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.503,639.084,"Which lets you appeal now, if you want, or later, if you prefer that?"
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,639.084,639.494,--Absolutely.
1997.97-5737,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.494,642.787,"But you don't think it's very logical, if I understood your colloquy with--"
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,642.787,645.318,Not if we stay with the strict language of the statute.
1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.939,675.227,"--Well, if there are in fact two reasonably plausible ways of interpreting this statute, it seems to me that, as the amicus points out, the result of your approach is going to produce a lot of appeals to courts of appeals that are very fact-specific and might result in no better for your client than going back to the agency and perhaps getting the relief there on the basis of the remand order."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,675.227,682.703,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that that likelihood is very probable, for the reasons set out in the brief."
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.199,705.07,"Well then, that... I understand your point now."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,715.076,716.138,That's correct.
1997.97-5737,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.138,720.159,"So that the Government is kind of saying, we're not going to plead it because we don't want all these appeals."
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,720.159,721.121,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-5737,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.769,747.049,Why have you?
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,752.243,752.683,Yes.
1997.97-5737,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.683,757.625,I take it that a person who gets a remand out of the court is probably going to get his benefits.
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,792.202,794.784,"Justice Breyer, that's exactly correct."
1997.97-5737,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.057,798.557,So why are you bringing it then?
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,798.557,799.228,It's a major risk.
1997.97-5737,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.228,801.401,Why do you think you'll get the money from the agency?
1997.97-5737,0,40834,ralph_wilborn,,801.401,814.328,"Because I am concerned that if we don't appeal now... the facts are so favorable for us, and she is a younger individual with an unpopular illness, that if she doesn't take it up now, the facts on remand will be even worse for her."
1997.97-5737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.212,819.514,"Very well, Mr. Wilborn."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,821.915,836.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,885.054,889.749,Is there on that question... just remind me of what is basic civil procedure.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,921.679,922.15,No.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.15,922.691,No.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,924.183,924.483,No.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.804,939.764,"So the only question in this case is whether the relationship of court to agency makes it special and is like the relationship, court to bankruptcy court, i.e., so you didn't have a final order."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,945.477,949.2,--In our view the... it had to have been--
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.2,950.77,"In other words, if there were no agency in this case--"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,950.77,951.0,--Right--
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.0,956.045,"--And we had a virtually... a judgment that gave one thing out of two, it certainly was appealable."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,956.045,956.255,--Yes.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,956.255,958.476,"Here we do have a judgment, one thing out of two."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,963.872,965.622,That's correct.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.178,1014.194,"You see, what I'd thought is... well, I was thinking bankruptcy judges, I think, and here I might be wrong, but if a district judge has an appeal from the bankruptcy judge and it has five parts to it and one part involves a remand back to the bankruptcy judge, I'm guessing but I think that that's not appealable on the ground that it isn't final in respect to all of the aspects of the judgment."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1016.164,1017.707,I don't know enough about bankruptcy law.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.707,1017.937,Okay.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1018.287,1019.628,But I do know that under--
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.628,1020.399,--I might be wrong.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1020.399,1027.815,"--At least if you certify an issue for appeal under 1292(b)... in other words, you take the finality consideration out of the picture."
1997.97-5737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.373,1061.508,"Ms. Blatt, you think, though, that an appeal could also be taken if the claimant waits until the end of remand?"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1061.508,1065.341,The claimant would appeal the second decision if she lost.
1997.97-5737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.409,1088.277,"And you think that... suppose she chooses not to appeal now, let's it go back on remand, litigates it, and then is not fully satisfied that she can appeal without having lost anything, as the claimant says she might do."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1088.277,1088.696,--That's correct.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.696,1090.448,That's... that couldn't possibly be right.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1099.725,1100.626,Right.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.626,1102.379,She now has a new proceeding.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1112.022,1112.523,Correct.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.523,1119.388,"The first ground is, even if they're right about the second proceeding, I deserved to win the first time."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1134.681,1135.122,As a--
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.122,1135.953,I think that's his complaint.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1135.953,1139.025,"--Well, as a practical matter I don't know that it would seem logical to work like that."
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.433,1154.014,"No, but he will... he wants to say one thing."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1165.824,1165.982,--Right.
1997.97-5737,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.982,1167.524,And that's the claim he's worried about losing.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1167.524,1168.085,Right.
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1179.515,1197.964,"Well, if Finkelstein is going to be followed, and it is final, then why wouldn't collateral estoppel attach, and why would anyone be able to say, look, I should have won the first time around, if, following the entry of a final judgment in that proceeding, one then goes in... through a new series of litigation, what is a new case by definition?"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1197.964,1198.645,--Right.
1997.97-5737,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.123,1210.604,"Ms. Blatt, wouldn't there be some doctrine other than collateral estoppel?"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1249.759,1254.913,"Well, courts have raised preclusion doctrines on their own, and it may be they're concerned about finality."
1997.97-5737,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.21,1295.751,"But what wouldn't... I think the way the court would get into it, willy nilly, the Government, is that I certainly would be disposed to say the issue that you're raising pertains to a prior decision of the Secretary."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1314.862,1315.132,Right.
1997.97-5737,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1315.132,1317.523,And it's not claim preclusion or issue preclusion.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1317.523,1330.323,"Right, but the second decision, the claimant in the second hearing is going to argue, I'm credible, I have too much pain, I can't work, my treating... that's all the evidence she has, is that I'm in pain and my treating physician thinks I'm in pain and I can't work."
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1352.067,1354.118,"No, but there's... she wants to raise a different issue."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1384.098,1393.896,"Well, I guess my... our position is, as to whether... in terms of whether she waits, she's not going to get interest on this money."
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1405.596,1408.29,"Yes, but let me ask the question another way."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1428.202,1431.504,"--No, it's a final judgment in the sense that it's immediately appealable."
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1448.677,1449.388,Yes.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1449.388,1454.563,The issue as to what happens on... not this case--
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1454.563,1459.746,"Well, if it's final, she can appeal, she doesn't appeal, why doesn't she waive her appeal?"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1459.746,1468.832,"--She waived her right to appeal the first action, but for purposes of whether she's entitled to disability benefits and whether the Commissioner had substantial evidence in denying--"
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1468.832,1470.171,"Oh, well then, maybe I misunderstood you."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1479.087,1480.199,"--Yes, because--"
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1480.199,1480.399,Yes.
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1480.399,1489.045,--the legal position in petitioner's brief is going to be the same whether she appeals now or appeals later.
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.045,1491.596,"Well, it may not be, because there may... Justice Breyer's example."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1507.849,1519.886,"Well, maybe this is a question of when... at what point she became disabled, but she claims her onset date was back in November of 1991 and so for purposes of whether there were jobs, I think that's what you'd be looking at."
1997.97-5737,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.461,1535.877,"Well, what you're saying is that necessarily in the second appeal everything that was subsumed in the first appeal is going to be presented."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1535.877,1537.559,As a practical matter--
1997.97-5737,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.559,1537.949,"No harm, no foul."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1564.517,1572.201,"--I'm not sure how that would work out in practicality, but what you may be describing is a situation where a claimant has an interest in taking an immediate appeal and doesn't want to wait."
1997.97-5737,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1573.991,1575.513,"I'm asking, suppose she does wait."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1583.478,1586.199,"--I think it is preserved, but it's--"
1997.97-5737,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.199,1590.813,"But why, if it's final, other than just the Government is not going to raise it?"
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1594.126,1599.619,"--It's final, and the first decision is no longer... maybe it's a question of semantics."
1997.97-5737,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1605.983,1615.339,"--So that she can lose the right to raise the specific theory, to advance this theory, because she's not appealed it."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1615.339,1625.917,"--The reason why it's difficult for me to answer that question is, I'm not sure there is such an example as a factual matter, where the evidence wouldn't be present in the second hearing."
1997.97-5737,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1625.917,1627.055,"Well, let's take this case."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1647.679,1652.785,"That is what she's arguing now, and it's what she could argue later, because--"
1997.97-5737,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1652.785,1665.073,"--The question is, if she did not take this first appeal, she goes back, she does what they allow her to do, still her expert doesn't come in and they still disbelieve her."
1997.97-5737,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1673.007,1673.468,--Yes.
1997.97-5737,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.89,1675.431,Yes.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1678.212,1683.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.245,1718.417,"How is it any different than the run-of-the-mill case where a person goes into court and he says, I want damages and an injunction?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1731.383,1741.571,"The key difference, Justice Breyer, we believe is that in the normal case that you posit there has been a final decision from which there is no further proceedings, other than in the court of appeals."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1741.571,1741.751,Right.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1764.805,1805.181,"We do not believe it is the end, Justice Breyer, because while the judgment is arguably final, and we can talk about the meaning of Finkelstein further, that accepting Finkelstein as requiring that this be viewed as a final judgment, that does not, we believe, resolve the question of whether under this statute, which opposes an additional limit on appealability... the statute says that the judgments under 405(g) are final, except that they shall be subject to review in the same manner as other judgments in other civil actions, and those standards that are applicable to other civil actions include, we submit, the appellate standing doctrine for which we've cited--"
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1805.181,1812.257,"But Mr. Snyder, why couldn't in the same manner mean in the same mode, like, I have 30 days to file a notice of appeal, or 60 days, or whatever it is?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1816.22,1826.116,"--Well, we certainly agree that it includes the examples that you gave, Justice Ginsburg, but it doesn't seem by its language to limit it to particular procedural requirements."
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1891.799,1900.725,"Mr. Snyder, suppose we had a Finkelstein-type appeal, so the Government, after the remand order the Government wants to appeal, we know it can."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1907.159,1907.74,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1907.74,1911.383,"Could she cross-appeal, then?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1911.383,1933.326,"Not under the circumstances of this case, where we think she lacks standing, and we think that that's not such an anomalous result as suggested by the Solicitor General's brief, because, for example, in cases dealing with remands to agencies in a typical APA-type case, that is normally not a final, reviewable decision."
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1966.948,1968.35,"Not a very efficient way to run a show, is it?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1972.912,1987.794,"Well, I think that the alternative, which is suggested by both the petitioner and the respondent, is extremely inefficient in the sense that there are 4,000-and-some remand decisions every year from this agency."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.567,2013.74,"Well, this isn't just limited to Social Security cases."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2043.379,2045.621,--The main difference--
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.621,2047.881,--would you expect a whole bunch of cases involving this issue.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2047.881,2054.476,"--Well, I don't believe that a decision here is likely to affect the broad array of such cases, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.476,2054.637,Why?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2054.637,2066.424,Because in the Administrative Procedure Act in the normal situation of a review of an agency decision I don't believe that you have the finality ruling that you have in this case.
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.424,2067.596,"Oh, you think that--"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2078.893,2083.397,"Absent... in most cases I think it's not if they remand, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.397,2084.96,Do you have cases to that effect?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2084.96,2105.86,"Well, the Occidental Petroleum case I mentioned cites scores of cases that say that in a typical review of an agency action the claimant, or the person challenging the agency action cannot appeal when there's been a remand, but there's an exception sometimes for the Government."
1997.97-5737,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.34,2111.185,"But you're saying that they're not aggrieved, and I'm puzzled, like Justice Scalia is."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2118.789,2121.102,--I didn't mean to suggest that they're not aggrieved.
1997.97-5737,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.535,2140.566,"Well, maybe I misunderstood you."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2144.767,2151.403,"--I am... our principal argument in today's case, with regard to this claimant, is that she's not aggrieved."
1997.97-5737,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.65,2175.769,"But sticking with the aggrieved, isn't she aggrieved because the wrong legal theory was adopted, just as in the routine case where we take cert, say, from the D.C. Circuit after it remands to an agency and it comes up here first?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2175.769,2191.29,"Well, typically the Court... this Court does not, I believe, typically take review from a circuit court if there's been a remand decision except where the Government seeks review because it otherwise would not be able to obtain review of the issue."
1997.97-5737,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2209.011,2212.922,How about if the person just wins partially and it's remanded?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2214.374,2225.211,"Well, if the remand offered them the opportunity, on remand, to win all of the relief that they were seeking, then I would argue that review would be inappropriate."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.598,2238.19,Why do you say she can still get what she sought?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2276.638,2280.912,"Well, I don't agree with the latter part of that, Justice Scalia, for this reason."
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.714,2299.866,You agree with the Government on that?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2299.866,2302.28,"Well, we agree partly with the Government."
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.091,2365.739,She would lose in the district court.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2365.739,2366.139,Yes.
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.139,2370.034,"But that doesn't mean she couldn't raise it in the Ninth Circuit, I take it."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2370.034,2371.853,That's our position that she... correct.
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.546,2400.104,"Oh, but I mean, my goodness, if you're talking about mucking... I mean, I wouldn't think there would be a deluge of litigation if we, you know, adopted the Government's theory, because most people will be satisfied with the remand and won't want to risk losing it."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2425.731,2440.24,"--No, I actually meant to say, Justice Breyer, and perhaps I misspoke, that after the second decision from the agency, that any issues from the first case that still affect the decision would be subject to review, because they would then be--"
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.24,2442.43,You mean the decision... that still affect the decision in the second case?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2442.43,2442.681,"--Yes, sir."
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2442.681,2443.001,Yes.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2443.001,2444.721,"That's... Justice Souter, that's--"
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.721,2447.684,But not issues that independent... that are independent of the second case.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2448.455,2451.407,--If the decision... yes.
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.407,2451.807,Yes.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2451.807,2461.144,"If the decision on the remand didn't deal at all with some issue that was dealt with earlier, then in reviewing the second case there would be no issue to review."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.144,2461.354,Right.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2508.888,2533.314,"Our position is that if a party asks a judge for a form of relief as an alternative, and indicating by asking it that this is something that the party is seeking, that it would be inviting the trial judge to make a supposed error if you allowed the party to turn around and appeal when the district judge did exactly what the party asked him to do."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.314,2543.68,"So in my case, if I go look up authority, which I haven't looked up, and then I find that in my arbitration case the person can appeal... he says, A, I want $100,000, but if not, send me to arbitration."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2556.378,2560.001,"Well, our... we've actually made a couple of alternative arguments."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.531,2561.731,But is my analogy good or not?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2564.563,2573.561,"--Well, I think it's a good analogy on the issue of whether the fact that you asked for a certain type of relief precludes you from then appealing when the court grants you the relief you asked for."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.218,2594.293,"Mr. Snyder, is it your position that she could not appeal... even if the Government appealed, she could not file a cross-appeal?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2598.166,2600.149,--I think it is the logic of the position.
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2616.341,2633.882,"Mr. Snyder, one of the questions that Justice Scalia asked, mustn't this come up over and over again with review of agency decisions, but we are dealing with a statute, and I'm not aware that the... it seems to me that 405(g)(4) and (8) are unusual."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2662.847,2671.892,"--Justice Ginsburg, we agree it's an unusual statute and that's what I was trying to get at when I referred to the differences between it and the typical agency decision."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.341,2715.653,"Well, how could it be appealed by the Government?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2729.023,2730.813,--That's right.
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.813,2731.094,Right?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2731.094,2732.564,The Government or the agency appeals--
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.564,2734.216,"Well, how can the agency appeal if it's not a final judgment?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2734.216,2747.945,"--Well, there have been some cases, as I referred to earlier, where the Government appeals from what is admittedly not a final judgment but because there may not be an opportunity for the Government ever to appeal the particular ruling that the lower court has made."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2747.945,2750.496,This isn't a weird little exception.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2752.528,2755.039,"Well, this case--"
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.039,2760.112,"--when it's remanded, and you're telling me it's appealing all of these nonfinal judgments in the ordinary cases?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2760.833,2764.847,"--Well, we certainly are not suggesting that the Government routinely appeals these cases."
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.53,2797.328,"Well, certainly in cases like California v. Stewart, where the evidence is thrown out in a criminal case, we have allowed not only the Federal Government but the State governments to appeal, because if... they might never have the opportunity to challenge that ruling again."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2797.328,2827.578,"And the... Mr. Chief Justice, the key distinction, we think, between that case and all these other cases and the kind of situation we have here is that in this case we believe, under the appellate standing doctrine... not finality issues, but appellate standing, the claimant is not aggrieved because at this point she has received not only the alternative relief she asked for in her complaint as a matter of pleading, but she also has received an opportunity to get every dollar of benefits she wants."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.747,2840.959,"Is that what it depends upon, the odds?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2840.959,2841.788,"No, I--"
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.788,2843.71,I'll give you an opportunity to win a million dollars.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2852.295,2854.756,"--She hasn't gotten it yet, Justice Breyer, and I agree--"
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.756,2855.167,"--Well, will she get it?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2855.167,2855.538,--Well--
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.538,2856.469,She'd love to have that assurance.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2856.469,2864.043,"--The courts will know whether she gets it, we'll all know whether she gets it after the remand, and if she gets it, there never will need to be an appeal."
1997.97-5737,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.451,2876.892,But that's not quite--
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2876.892,2877.162,--I can't quantify it.
1997.97-5737,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.954,2881.115,"--But that's not completely true, is it?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2896.426,2908.174,"Well, if the subsequent decision were based on legal rulings from this earlier case we think they could be reviewed later, but if... I understand, Justice Stevens, your question to be, if there's simply a new record--"
1997.97-5737,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.174,2908.595,Right.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2908.595,2916.628,"--and the facts are different in the new case, then I agree that the courts would review the new record based on the record as it then stands, and that's not uncommon."
1997.97-5737,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.628,2920.061,"No, but it could be more... less favorable to her, that's all I'm saying."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2920.562,2920.932,Well--
1997.97-5737,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.932,2929.207,"She might have just exactly what she wants in the record now, and she thinks as a matter of law she's entitled to prevail now, but when more evidence goes in it might not be quite as clear."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2935.042,2937.745,"--I don't really think it is what's going on here, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5737,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.922,2969.705,"That's a good point, so why wouldn't we make that same point to the Government?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2986.496,3000.945,"Well, in a case... this Court's decision in United States v. Jose that we cited, the Court allowed the Government to appeal that nonfinal decision because there were particular provisions in the Court's decree that were binding on the Government in the meantime."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.914,3059.606,"Now, do I... what you said just before this, do I understand it to be your position that in these cases... you know, I mean, she's only gotten half of what she wanted, but the Government has only gotten half of what it wanted, and the Government may win when it goes back, just as she may win when it goes back."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3070.063,3075.217,"No, Justice Scalia, because this Court's decision in Finkelstein held to the contrary."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.25,3081.49,Right.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3081.49,3082.302,--particularized need.
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.712,3085.724,"I thought so, which is... makes it sort of inconsistent with your theory."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3094.31,3095.071,--Finkelstein--
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.071,3097.512,Why should the rule be any different for the other side?
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3097.512,3102.908,"--Finkelstein only decided the issue of finality, Justice Scalia, with reference to this statute."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.736,3115.467,"Well, you can't have it both ways."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3132.16,3132.94,"--Yes, sir."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.94,3135.822,"But then you go on to say, Finkelstein only decided finality."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3136.23,3138.683,"I... let me try to be clearer, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.168,3145.668,Well--
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3145.668,3148.38,Finkelstein simply did not address appellate standing.
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.38,3149.652,"--Oh, it didn't address appellate standing."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3161.53,3162.471,"Well, we--"
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.471,3163.411,That would have to be your position.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3163.411,3167.214,"--It's not a position we've taken up to this moment, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.214,3169.517,"No, I know it isn't, because it's not a very attractive one."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3179.014,3179.244,No.
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3179.244,3183.338,--So the only people who appeal to the district court are the claimants.
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3183.338,3184.089,That's correct.
1997.97-5737,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.375,3199.15,"No, but when the Government loses, the Government can still go... I assume that when the Government loses in the district court, it can always go up, and I don't think you have to look to see, could the point be raised elsewhere."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3205.104,3216.113,"--I agree that the issue of appellate standing has never, to my knowledge, been raised with regard to a Government appeal to a circuit court in this--"
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3216.113,3237.527,"But once the decision has been held final for purposes of the Government's dissatisfaction, what other issues might come into a question of whether the Government has appellate standing that have not already been subsumed in whether the decision is final for purposes of the Government's ultimate right to appeal it?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3260.292,3276.862,"--If someone were arguing that the Government was not aggrieved by the decision, then obviously, if the Government could show that there was an issue of law that couldn't otherwise be reviewed, they would most clearly be aggrieved."
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.118,3298.967,"I guess I come back to the point that Finkelstein is terribly, terribly subtle if it was reserving the point of aggrievement."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3298.967,3300.247,I don't believe it was reserving--
1997.97-5737,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3300.247,3301.789,"It's a rather misleading case, I guess."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3301.789,3304.412,"--Justice Souter, I don't... I'm not asserting that it reserved that issue."
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3332.314,3334.064,"But wouldn't claimants' attorneys appreciate that, too?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3340.759,3342.88,"--Yes, ma'am, between 60 and 65 percent."
1997.97-5737,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.88,3352.025,"So wouldn't... whether there is that second opportunity or not, wouldn't many attorneys say, look, save the money?"
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3352.025,3353.287,I'm sure many would.
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.163,3360.433,"Thank you, Mr. Snyder."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3360.433,3360.653,Thank you.
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3360.653,3365.335,"You appeared here as an amicus by appointment to the Court, and the Court wishes to express its appreciation to you."
1997.97-5737,2,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3365.335,3365.915,Thank you.
1997.97-5737,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3365.915,3368.678,"Mr. Wilborn, you have 1 minute remaining."
1997.97-5737,3,40834,ralph_wilborn,,3368.678,3370.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-5737,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3410.702,3422.358,"Mr. Wilborn, you're an expert in this area, and I'm just... in listening to this hour's argument I'm wondering, why wasn't the Social Security benefit arrangement ever changed to conform to the railroad retirement by simply cutting out the district courts?"
1997.97-5737,3,40834,ralph_wilborn,,3428.403,3431.484,"--I'm not aware that it ever was, Justice Ginsburg, although it may be--"
1997.97-5737,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3431.484,3434.556,"Because it's what, five levels now, three inside the agency and two in the courts?"
1997.97-5737,3,40834,ralph_wilborn,,3434.556,3434.816,--Yes.
1997.97-5737,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3434.816,3435.517,Possibly six.
1997.97-5737,3,40834,ralph_wilborn,,3435.517,3440.381,"Justice Ginsburg is no longer a court of appeals judge, or she wouldn't--"
1997.97-5737,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3440.602,3443.474,"Thank you, Mr. Wilborn."
1997.97-5737,3,40834,ralph_wilborn,,3443.474,3443.712,Thank you.
1997.97-5737,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.712,3444.628,The case is submitted.
