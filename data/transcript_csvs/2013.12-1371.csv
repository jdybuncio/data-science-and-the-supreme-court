2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.035,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-1371, United States v. Castleman."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,5.904,9.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.81,76.345,I -- I'm a little bit concerned about going to that common law meaning.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,84.468,85.57,"--Oh, it certainly is."
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,91.289,91.957,Exactly.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,91.957,95.609,And it's certainly different than ‶ violent ″ when it's modifying the word ‶ felony ″.
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,99.145,101.68,Misdemeanor domestic violence.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,101.68,103.531,--Misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.06,124.028,Are threats of violence domestic violence?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,124.028,127.914,"--They are, not in this -- not with respect to this particular statute."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.914,128.464,I hope not.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,128.464,134.068,"No, in this particular statute, Congress focused on a particular form of domestic violence."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.388,142.34,Do we have to think that domestic violence is different from violence?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,152.095,166.105,"--It would, but, I mean, domestic violence -- my point here is that domestic but violence has a different connotation, even if you were to move away from the phrase ‶ domestic violence ″, Your Honor, this statute does talk about misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, and that's the term that we are defining here."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.859,175.877,"If I punch somebody in the nose, is that violence?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,175.877,178.079,"--I'm sorry, if you punch somebody in the nose?"
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.079,179.163,If I punch somebody in the nose.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,179.163,179.896,"Yes, that is violence."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.896,180.413,Okay.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,184.9,187.184,"No, and we're not arguing--"
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.184,189.251,"Any physical action that hurts somebody is violence, isn't it?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,189.251,192.838,"--It certainly is, and we are not arguing for a special rule here."
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,193.938,207.765,"How about pinching or biting, hair pulling, shoving, grabbing, hitting, slapping; would those be violence or would they be domestic violence if you are doing it against a spouse?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,210.132,213.336,"--If you are doing it against a spouse it is domestic violence, but I'm not sure it is any different."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.511,229.911,I don't understand that point.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,241.903,246.557,It -- it certainly would be the same as long as it fit within the scope of that statute.
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,246.557,249.509,Why are you talking about -- why are you talking about patterns of domestic violence?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,249.509,251.877,Only to focus on what Congress was doing here.
2013.12-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.23,291.419,"I have no problem with the description of what Congress had in mind, routine conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,317.403,327.192,"--And our view is that it cannot be caused by a means other than physical force, if you understand the definition of physical force at common law."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.827,390.867,"Maybe I am missing something here, but I thought Justice Ginsburg's question was not addressed to the Federal statute, but to the Tennessee statute."
2013.12-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.867,391.301,Yes.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.301,396.438,"And it's the Federal statute that uses physical force, right?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,398.421,400.823,The Tennessee statute talks about causing bodily injury--
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.823,402.342,Causing bodily injury.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,402.342,406.044,"--but you cannot cause a bodily injury without using physical force, and that is our point."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.061,411.115,"I'm sorry, you cannot cause bodily injury without using physical force?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,411.115,414.65,--You cannot intentionally cause bodily injury without using physical force.
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,414.65,422.821,"So if the victim is at the top of the stairwell and you go ‶ boo ″, and he or she falls down and is injured, is that physical force?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,422.821,423.689,It is physical force.
2013.12-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.073,459.529,"You take the position that the person with the camera says, ‶ Back up two steps ″, so that the other person falls over the cliff, that's physical force?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,459.529,471.586,"--Instances where it is intentional, absolutely, because it includes not only, again, direct applications by the aggressor, but when the aggressor sets something in motion and causes physical force to act against the person of another."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.586,473.438,So it's not a limiting term at all.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,477.39,479.692,If there is bodily injury.
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,485.746,492.65,"So if I did the same thing to two different people and one is injured and the other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not the other time?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,492.65,500.839,"--You are using physical force one time and not the other time because there is the actual physical force being applied against the person of another, and contrary--"
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.839,503.041,Where is the actual physical force being applied?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,503.041,506.493,"--When the person is injured, when the person hits the ground."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,506.493,506.81,Okay.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,514.08,517.115,"I take that back, I didn't realize they both hit the wall."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,521.086,522.102,But only one was injured.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,522.102,524.954,--And then they wouldn't be covered by the Tennessee statute.
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.39,553.79,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,565.448,568.4,I -- I think that's -- that may be a bit different.
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,611.077,615.381,But it might not include scaring the person and the person having a heart attack.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,615.381,617.75,I'm not sure if the common law would include that.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.842,647.935,"So your position is whenever -- whenever somebody is injured by reason of the intentional act of somebody else, that has been an application of violent force."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,647.935,650.821,That has been an application of violent force.
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,656.558,657.125,Not violent force.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,657.125,657.858,And we don't--
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.858,660.327,The statutory term is physical force.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,660.327,660.66,--Right.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.497,793.514,Wait.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,799.15,800.217,"No, that's not what I'm--"
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.217,802.852,"Whenever there's domestic strife, guns are dangerous?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,802.852,804.887,--That -- that is not what I'm saying.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.654,807.173,"Clearly, that's not what Congress had in mind."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,807.173,810.208,--Congress certainly had in mind assault and battery offenses.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.208,810.741,Okay.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,810.741,812.827,The quintessential domestic violence--
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.827,816.612,I don't know why you have to tie this to domestic -- domestic violence.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,822.033,828.42,"--In this statute, Congress was focused specifically on people who harm their family members, the very people that they're supposed to protect."
2013.12-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,852.868,862.408,And one of Respondent's arguments is that Congress may have enacted this on the assumption that we were not going to go off with this modified categorical approach that we have created.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,863.343,875.151,"I don't think it can be, because I think the Court has adopted both the categorical approach and its modified categorical variant, largely at least starting in Taylor, as a means of statutory interpretation."
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,928.935,929.902,Can I ask you about that Ms. Sherry?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,957.472,962.756,"--Well, you're going to have real difficulty prosecuting in about 28 States and the District of Columbia."
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,980.335,982.853,"Well, presumably, if they're divisible, you don't have a problem."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1011.439,1014.741,--It -- it depends on what you mean by -- by divisible.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.014,1028.151,"Well, how many -- how many include?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1031.27,1034.138,--28 States and the District of Columbia include mere touching.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.828,1072.347,--Well--
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.347,1074.247,"Of the 28 States, if I could just understand this--"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1074.247,1075.047,--Sure.
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1075.047,1078.667,"--Of the 28 States, how many separated out on the face of the statute as between--"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1078.667,1079.034,I believe--
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1079.034,1080.301,--offensive touching and bodily injury?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1080.301,1086.237,"--I think there's 14 that separated out on the face of the statute, and 14 that are -- are common law."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.574,1095.776,--What do you want us to do with those 14 that don't separate it out?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1100.097,1100.914,"Well, we -- yes."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.27,1108.87,Just touching.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1109.486,1110.586,Just touching is.
2013.12-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1138.722,1151.93,"Well, I realize that in this area we're supposed to forget anything about what we might actually know about the real world, but are there really a lot of cases in which one spouse is convicted for offensive touching of another spouse?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1154.832,1158.553,I think you will find cases in which that's what the statute says.
2013.12-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1159.786,1160.369,Where the facts--
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1160.369,1161.821,--I do not think--
2013.12-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1161.821,1163.171,--are that there is nothing more than an offensive touching?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1163.171,1169.574,"--No, I don't think you will find cases where a husband tickled his wife with a feather or tapped his wife on the shoulder for a couple--"
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1169.574,1171.193,How does marital rape figure in this?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1179.532,1185.353,--I don't know the answer -- I don't know the answer to that.
2013.12-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.782,1278.03,"It's strictly background information, but if you have a case of domestic violence of the aggravated sort, and there's a plea -- an offer to plead guilty in the State court, as you understand it, does the State court have the obligation to say that if you plead guilty to this crime, you cannot buy a weapon?"
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1280.898,1285.651,"Not as a matter of Federal law, but if I can give two qualifications on that."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1353.28,1355.063,But doesn't that assume the conclusion of the case?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1355.063,1370.741,"--I'm not suggesting that that's how -- that the Court should decide that legally, but in terms -- if there is any concerns about notice, what I'm saying is that the ATF form that individuals fill out when they go to purchase a weapon specifically refers to assault and battery, and there's a good reason for that."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.193,1379.078,--How do we get to the common law meaning of ‶ force ″?
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1389.536,1391.821,--And it -- and it defines what that means.
2013.12-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1414.151,1419.488,"Of course, that's the same language as was in Johnson, but you would be asking us to apply it differently here."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1419.488,1421.524,It is very similar language to Johnson.
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1442.754,1453.811,"Johnson relied on a number of things, but the two were the use of felony and the use of the word ‶ violent force ″, which is not what this statute does."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1461.899,1465.636,"In Johnson, ACCA does also use ‶ physical force ″."
2013.12-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1481.563,1489.734,You're asking us to use the terms in their common law sense because of the nature of this -- of this provision.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1489.734,1491.084,Because of the nature of this provision.
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.924,1500.476,"Yes, of course."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1543.219,1547.94,"--Your Honor, if I could answer quickly, and then reserve the balance of my time, I'd point out two different things."
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1562.298,1568.002,"It distinguishes Johnson, but it doesn't get rid of the word ‶ violence ″, which is -- which is what is being defined."
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1568.002,1568.687,--And I think it does--
2013.12-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.687,1571.555,You are saying violence is being defined as a mere touching.
2013.12-1371,0,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1572.955,1578.059,"--Again, I think domestic violence has a different connotation, and it's also a fundamentally different statutory scheme."
2013.12-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.942,1581.578,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1586.915,1587.865,Thank you.
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1605.86,1614.215,You're suggesting that you can commit a crime of violence because you have to use violent force.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1648.889,1652.44,"--Well, there are a couple of things there, and let me try to unpack it."
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.29,1677.44,It certainly causes injury.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1677.44,1678.875,--There's no question it causes injury.
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1679.392,1683.646,Pushing someone lightly over a cliff causes a lot of injury.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1696.286,1698.988,"--Well, again, let me focus on -- there are two separate arguments."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.002,1770.585,Excuse me.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1787.963,1788.663,"--Well, let me say--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.663,1793.2,I can't believe that Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1793.2,1794.267,"--Well, first--"
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.267,1796.235,"It wouldn't be the first mistake of course, right?"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.287,1807.893,"Some people who don't read legislative history don't know that, but if you did read the legislative history, you would see that they do want to have an effect with this statute."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1807.893,1812.495,"--Well, I -- I will agree with sort of both of those -- that Congress does make mistakes."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.732,1818.982,"Well, in your reading, what would it have accomplished?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1818.982,1823.552,"--First of all, what Congress meant to accomplish here is -- I have to take issue with my friend Ms. Sherry."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.085,1846.702,I agree with you.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1868.931,1872.033,"--Well, if I can, let me finish my answer to your -- to your prior question."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.033,1872.819,Please.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1872.819,1902.421,"It's exactly what Congress had in mind here, and I think we do agree with the government on this, that Congress perceived a loophole in the law at the time because the firearm restriction at the time applied only to felons and people who engaged in violent conduct, as Senator Lautenberg, the principal sponsor said, that because of the outdated thinking by prosecutors, people who engaged in violent conduct are to be prosecuted against as a felony, if committed against somebody else, was prosecuted as a misdemeanor because a family member was the victim."
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.377,1968.697,"Even if they wouldn't, once again, Congress may have miscalculated."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1984.908,1987.777,"--That -- that is absolutely right as an example, Your Honor."
2013.12-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2003.454,2012.743,"So in your view, and I think you said this in your brief, but what constitutes violent conduct?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2019.046,2023.467,"--Well, it -- I wouldn't categorically say that those things do not qualify."
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2038.643,2046.647,"Mr. Rothfeld, I thought that what Johnson said, it defined physical force as force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2057.438,2063.274,"--Well, I think Johnson had no occasion to -- to specify what level of force was necessary, what level of pain."
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2063.958,2064.458,No.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2073.047,2073.514,--But--
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2073.514,2075.316,That's the clear standard in the holding.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2075.316,2089.742,"--I guess I would have to respectfully suggest that the way I read Johnson is to -- is to say that it was enough for the Court to decide that case to say that defensive touching, that mere touching was not enough, that something more than that is required."
2013.12-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2128.867,2131.586,"Mr. Rothfeld, you still owe Justice Breyer an answer."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2131.586,2133.521,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.996,2191.124,"That's true, and that's what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that some of the -- quite a few, actually, of the statutes that they cite have different categories and some of the categories would escape being covered by offensive touching and others wouldn't."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2212.89,2214.94,--I can't give you a precise number to that.
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.675,2221.477,"When you say ‶ substantial ″, I mean, you've read all these and do you have he an idea of--"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2221.477,2222.595,--I--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.595,2226.03,"--You've thought about this question, so you must have some rough idea."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2227.566,2239.188,"--I think at least some dozens of States that have use of force, that have causing bodily injury, defined bodily injury to a list of things that one can do--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.188,2239.724,Yeah.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2239.724,2249.396,"--and some of those things are going to be necessarily violent things, and so in all of those cases, if the injury is inflicted in that respect and it's properly charged, it--"
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.396,2251.348,Can you give me an example of that?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2256.817,2266.357,"--Well, the Tennessee statute, which is at issue here says ‶ causing bodily injury ″ and defines separately ‶ bodily injury ″, and this appears in--"
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.357,2271.493,So he was convicted of causing violent injury?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2271.493,2277.832,"--He was convicted of causing bodily injury, but there was no specific indication."
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.832,2280.701,So we sort of have two extreme positions here.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2295.359,2298.061,We are saying it covers bodily injury which--
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.061,2299.829,Why isn't there something in the middle?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2302.115,2306.832,--That would be an approach the Court could take.
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.434,2308.751,"Yeah, but you would lose, right?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2310.051,2311.253,--We think that's inconsistent--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.253,2314.772,"Let's assume, just to help you for a change -- I mean, not for a change, you help a lot."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2344.024,2352.13,"--Several dozens of States -- well, I think -- it may well be that--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.13,2358.201,"See, what we do is where it's -- where it's inseparable, where it comes in two separate clauses, then modified categorical approach applies."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2377.946,2382.917,"--I -- I believe there are some States that use a common law standard, as -- as Ms. Sherry said, and -- but--"
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2382.917,2383.817,Ms. Sherry said 14.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2384.851,2385.635,--I -- I think that that's right.
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2414.788,2416.74,It doesn't say any level of pain.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2437.403,2440.955,"Well, the Tennessee statute -- I have to take issue with that, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.425,2447.642,Soap in the eyes.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2447.642,2449.127,--Soap in the eyes.
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.865,2457.531,You think causing the pain was intentional there?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2457.531,2460.067,"--In -- in this case, the allegation--"
2013.12-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2460.067,2466.838,"And you don't think that if -- have you ever had soap in your eye, that somebody threw the soap in to cause you pain intentionally?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2469.072,2472.826,--I think that that would be bodily injury within the meaning of the statute.
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.826,2474.076,How about soap in the mouth?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2476.961,2478.48,"I'll leave that one alone, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.48,2482.948,"Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do you think the injury has to be?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2485.3,2490.788,I -- I would -- serious injury is a -- a recognized standard in the law.
2013.12-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.34,2503.929,"When I asked you the question, you -- you were hesitant about scratching, bruising, slapping."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2503.929,2512.634,"I would -- I would -- my own view is that a slap in the face, which was something that the Court in Johnson used as an example, would be violent."
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.115,2536.083,"Well, none of those things would be done intentionally, so they -- they don't scare me."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2562.567,2566.519,There is no question that those would be covered under the terms of the text that the government is adding.
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.519,2577.41,"--Well, how -- now, just drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2627.91,2629.278,I think it is generally true.
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.496,2638.717,"Then I don't see -- I think it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2668.487,2670.054,"--Well, it's--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.054,2671.705,So what do we do?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2671.705,2674.907,--It is a consequence -- the problem you identified of the categorical--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.907,2675.907,"Yes, yes."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2680.211,2699.273,"--Our -- our view is that if the Court States as a standard what we believe the language of the statute requires, that there be violent force used, that people will charge crimes with sufficient specificity in the indictments so that it will allow for that to be picked up and qualified as a predicate offense as appropriate."
2013.12-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.054,2739.648,"But on you reading, it seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to cover, it didn't; that is, the -- the defendant has brutally beaten the mother of his child."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2751.206,2761.346,"--I would say that if someone who did that is prosecuted under a generic assault statute that does not have as an element the use of force and the relevance that is violent force, then that -- that is true."
2013.12-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.346,2768.417,"So that means that on your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we know Congress wanted to cover."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2768.417,2770.452,"Well, I -- I would take issue with that, Your Honor."
2013.12-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2833.876,2846.952,"Would it make any difference in your view if instead of domestic violence, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2846.952,2848.419,It -- it would make quite a difference.
2013.12-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2893.414,2896.283,"But Mr. Rothfeld, this might go back to our difference on what Johnson said."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2927.404,2931.273,"Well, I -- I do not suggest that you should apply a higher standard than Johnson."
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.456,2986.36,"But I -- really you have no answer to Johnson, except that -- that statement was dictum."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2994.263,3000.85,"--I -- I took that statement to say that absent some infliction of pain and injury, that's not enough."
2013.12-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.184,3235.571,"Well, if you want to send Congress back to the drawing board, what could they do?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3252.949,3257.151,Well -- they could modify the modified categorical approach.
2013.12-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3259.537,3261.639,"Other than that, what could they do?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3261.639,3269.559,I think they could identify particular types of -- of violence that would qualify.
2013.12-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3270.761,3277.998,How would you -- how would you identify those without changing the assault and battery statutes of the -- of the 50 States?
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3277.998,3287.687,"--Well, I don't think that Congress could -- could do it by simply absorbing the assault statutes as they are written, because they are overbroad."
2013.12-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3289.02,3298.06,So all the States would have to go back and change their statutes in order to -- to segregate the cases that within the parameters that you--
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3298.06,3298.51,"--Well, no, I--"
2013.12-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3298.51,3299.245,--that you think are required.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3299.245,3301.797,"--I think that is not so, Justice Alito."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3320.491,3327.829,"Can you remind me of something which I -- if you interpret this broadly, to include battery, suppose you do it."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3333.549,3334.168,--That is correct.
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.168,3340.905,"Is it also the case that there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15-year prison sentence, or not?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3340.905,3343.774,"No, it would not."
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3343.774,3344.174,No.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3346.643,3349.678,The consequence of this conviction in this--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3349.678,3357.866,"I mean, you would say yes, contrary to your argument, the same words do mean something differently in the two sentence -- in the two sections."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3362.802,3363.402,--Well--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3363.402,3379.03,"And if that happened, and you can defined the physical force in the misdemeanor section as much broader, would in fact there be a consequence for anyone, other than not being able to carry a gun?"
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3381.899,3385.784,"--Well, I think to the extent that that definition flowed back to the--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3385.784,3386.134,"No, no."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3398.508,3401.027,"--Well, and if you did carry a gun, and--"
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3401.027,3401.51,Yes.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3403.662,3406.681,--It would be a -- up to a 10-year Federal--
2013.12-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3406.681,3410.133,It wouldn't be the extra 15 years you would get for violent felonies.
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3410.133,3415.203,--That -- that is true if the Court said that the identical language meant different things.
2013.12-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3415.203,3429.98,"I -- I assume that your point is it's a trap for the unwary, that -- that someone who has not really been guilty of violent action would not expect that he's covered by the -- by the prohibition on carrying a gun."
2013.12-1371,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3431.43,3434.149,"If I may, just for very briefly."
2013.12-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3448.074,3448.841,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
2013.12-1371,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3450.21,3455.53,I have four points.
2013.12-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3698.336,3700.669,"Thank you, counsel."
