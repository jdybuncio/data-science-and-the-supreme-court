1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.496,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1488, Sue Suter v. Artist M.."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,24.198,26.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.301,189.237,What about the Sherman Act?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,206.413,213.353,"But what is missing here, Justice Scalia, is a specific designation that Congress intended to create a Federal right."
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.076,229.462,"Well, I may agree with you on that, but not because it is too vague."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,237.484,251.478,"What this Court has said in Wilder is to set out a three-part test for when under section 1983 this Court can infer a congressional intent to create a Federal right, and the third element of that test is whether the interest is too vague and amorphous."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,270.038,276.592,"Let me ask you on that point, is it so vague that the Secretary could never enforce this provision?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,276.592,288.333,"--No, what the Secretary does and the Congress has specifically delegated to the Secretary the authority to approve a plan, to make sure that it provides reasonable efforts or to withdraw funds if not."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.333,298.689,"Well, suppose it... you have a plan approved such as this one and then assume the State or whatever the agency is, did absolutely nothing to implement it, could the funds be withdrawn?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,298.689,302.307,The funds... the Secretary would have the discretion to withdraw the funds.
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.307,306.525,But would it be following a... enforcing a Federal right if he did so?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,306.525,306.809,No.
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.194,341.948,"Why can't you use the same test to ask whether a Federal right has been violated, but where nothing at all is being done?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,341.948,354.822,"What we need, Justice Stevens, is a benchmark that governs not only the easy case that you have posed, which is where there is simply no efforts at all that are being exerted by the State, but also the harder case, which I submit is this case."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.822,364.178,"But that is what Justice Scalia's question was directed to, is that reasonableness is a standard that is judicially enforceable in other contexts, but you say not in this context."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,364.178,371.498,"I say not in this case because for example, in this case, this is not the case where the State was making no reasonable efforts at all, never assigning--"
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.498,374.967,But this case will decide that case as well.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,374.967,382.121,"--I think that is true, and I think the problems in this case demonstrate the problems with having a reasonable efforts clause that is not defined by Congress."
1991.90-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.665,470.222,"Is there anything about the subject matter of the judgment which makes the Secretary more competent, or perhaps I should say a more appropriate person to make the judgment about reasonableness than a court?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,470.222,471.424,"I think so, Justice Souter."
1991.90-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.139,522.874,"I am sorry, I thought you have finished."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,522.874,536.867,"--They are not even reasonable efforts, I think, to set reasonable rates or reasonable rents, as in the Wright case, which are monetary calculations that could be measured against a marketplace, and in addition, this Court required specific lengthy factors in the statute."
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.162,564.418,"Ms. Tchen, do you acknowledge that the statute requires the State to make reasonable efforts in each case?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,564.418,564.834,We agree.
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.869,569.236,Where does it require that?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,569.236,570.169,"Well, it states--"
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.169,579.608,"As I read it, the section we are talking about, 671(a)(15) requires the State to come up with a plan that would produce reasonable efforts, but nothing is perfect."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,590.999,596.903,"--No, what we think is, it wouldn't necessarily violate (a)(15), which requires the State to have a plan that provides reasonable efforts."
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.269,598.003,What does it violate then?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,598.003,611.211,"--There is a separate section, section 672(a) that says that in individual cases, that in order to receive Federal reimbursement, there must be a State judicial determination of whether reasonable efforts were made in the best interest of the child."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.602,650.788,"Well, it speaks of a plan."
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,650.788,652.238,It speaks of a plan--
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.238,655.505,What's the difference between a system and a plan in your view?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,655.505,665.88,"--Here the plan is an actual document, as in many other Federal and State cooperative funding acts, which requires that the State put together a document, submit it to the Secretary and have it approved."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.88,669.999,And that is what has to provide that reasonable efforts will be made?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,669.999,670.415,That's right.
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.415,671.117,It's the plan.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,671.117,671.734,Is the plan.
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.621,682.156,They agree that the plan provides for reasonable efforts?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,682.156,683.24,--They simply never raised the plan.
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.24,684.192,They never raised--
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,684.192,685.775,They never raised the plan.
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.06,781.57,--What are the reasonableness requirements that the Court must determine under 672 in the event of payment to a child?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,781.57,782.67,What the reasonableness--
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.67,783.07,Where is that?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,784.286,785.403,--It's 672.
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.807,791.323,The blue brief?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,791.323,795.092,The blue brief.
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.092,795.794,I have been looking for it.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,798.594,813.505,"672(a)(1), it's not quoted in full, but on page 24, it's stated that the foster care placement must be the result of a judicial determination that continuation at home, quote,"
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,821.009,829.515,So the statute does require the courts in this instance to make a determination whether or not reasonable efforts have been made.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,834.919,836.202,"Yes, it is, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,855.965,862.069,So the reasonableness of the plan is not in question in the inquiry that is made under 672(a)(1)?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,862.069,863.152,"--No, it's not."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.96,881.197,"Ms. Tchen, will you file with the clerk, as soon as you can after the argument, a full copy of the section you were just talking about?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,881.197,883.232,"Yes, I will, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.232,886.351,If you find it's not otherwise in the briefs or in the appendix.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,886.351,886.751,Yes.
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.094,909.163,"You say it doesn't appear in the statute, but the statute does require the plan to include a systemic right, doesn't it?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,909.163,913.798,"--No, it says a plan that provides that in each case, reasonable efforts will be made."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.798,917.0,"Well, the in each case language is in... I thought it was in (a)(2)?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,917.0,917.4,No.
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.745,939.713,"Yes, but the very fact that the requirement is in a plan means it has to be part of the system, doesn't it?"
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,939.713,939.93,No.
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.145,970.066,What you are saying is the plan required by the Secretary contemplates variation for different kinds of cases.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,970.066,979.072,"The plan simply says a list of services, that the States to comply with the plan, what the regulations say, is that there is a list of services which States may choose to--"
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.072,982.774,May I ask if that regulation is in the materials before us?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,982.774,988.88,--I don't believe it's quoted in full but it is also cited both in our brief and in the brief of the United States.
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.196,990.963,I just have one question.
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,1008.257,1011.543,I don't think that is a question that has been directly addressed by this Court.
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1018.963,1021.399,But the inquiry there would be the same if such an action were brought?
1991.90-1488,0,20189,christina_m_tchen,,1021.399,1028.969,"--It's an analogous inquiry, I think, under Heckler whether there is no law to apply, and I would like to reserve the balance of my time."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.969,1030.338,"Very well, Ms. Tchen."
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1038.925,1042.396,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.396,1048.483,"Mr. Roberts, could you answer Justice Kennedy's... just the question he just put from the point of view of the Government?"
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1048.483,1048.7,--Yes.
1991.90-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.607,1063.809,Prosecutorial discretion?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1063.809,1070.129,"Well, the discretion of how to enforce the requirements of the statute against the States, yes."
1991.90-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.22,1139.809,"How do you answer Justice Scalia's question about the Sherman Act and its reasonableness standard, Mr. Roberts?"
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1139.809,1144.861,"First of all, the Sherman Act specifically directs the courts to enforce the provision."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.05,1187.204,"Does that mean, Mr. Roberts, that the secretary could never withhold funds for failure to comply with this provision?"
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.204,1187.937,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.828,1204.88,Are they entrusted pursuant to any standard specified by Congress or are they entirely made up by the secretary?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1204.88,1209.351,"Well, the secretary's determination of what's reasonable in specific cases."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.351,1212.219,"How does the secretary know what's reasonable, that is what I am asking you."
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1212.219,1222.424,"He knows by making the sorts of policy judgments on each case, as a State submits a particular plan and they say here is what we are going to do to comply with reasonable efforts, the secretary makes policy judgments--"
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.424,1225.693,Are those policy judgments guided by anything Congress says in the statute?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1225.693,1230.43,"--No, other than reasonable efforts, that is what confines the secretary's discretion."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.73,1238.018,How does it confine the secretary's discretion anymore than it would confine the judge's discretion?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1238.018,1247.624,"--It doesn't confine the secretary's more than a judge's, but the secretary, the Congress determined, had the expert experience in the field of child welfare to make the policy judgments."
1991.90-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.38,1260.114,Without any legislative guidance whatsoever?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1260.114,1266.251,--The guidance is simply reasonable efforts to keep families together and to provide for the return of the children.
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.251,1269.787,"Almost as vague as public interest, convenience, and necessity, isn't it?"
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1269.787,1275.572,"Well, except that in this case there are no objective standards to which a court can resort."
1991.90-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.614,1313.38,What are the State courts supposed to use?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1320.303,1329.176,The State courts can apply it in the context of a particular removal decision involving a particular child and a particular family history.
1991.90-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.697,1399.386,"Well, I suppose the State in submitting a plan promises to live up to it."
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.386,1399.672,Yes.
1991.90-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.992,1407.492,"Says that is a good way, that's fine."
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.107,1433.659,"Well, in the first place, that's not what is involved here."
1991.90-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.582,1442.399,What does it say?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1442.399,1449.503,"It simply lists the State services that are available, through which it intends to comply with the requirement."
1991.90-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.503,1456.425,Doesn't it mean that in each case these services will be available?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.425,1461.663,"It means that in each case reasonable efforts will be made, and here is an array of services from which they can draw."
1991.90-1488,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.33,1469.249,What if the State doesn't provide any services at all?
1991.90-1488,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1469.249,1471.268,"--Well, in some cases that may be appropriate."
1991.90-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.305,1561.488,Very well Mr. Roberts.
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1566.975,1570.261,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1591.507,1600.965,"Do you agree with the petitioner, Mr. Dsida, that your clients have not attacked the plan filed by the State at all?"
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1600.965,1604.0,"Your Honor, I don't think that is a fair characterization of our complaint."
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.904,1613.106,Why do the defendants have to make reasonable efforts?
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1618.658,1632.5,"--Your Honor, the plan also must be in effect... it's clear that the statute requires that the specific obligations under the plan must be implemented by the State and that has been this Court's position under Federal/State cooperative--"
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.5,1635.269,So what's your answer to the question I asked you?
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1640.589,1641.389,--We did attack the plan.
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.362,1651.647,But that's two different things.
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1651.647,1652.597,"Your Honor, the plan--"
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.597,1654.183,Isn't that two different things?
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1663.538,1664.754,"--That is two different things, Your Honor."
1991.90-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.674,1678.078,"And that's what the statutory language that... at least the petitioners were talking about related to, isn't it?"
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1678.078,1681.847,The statutory language requires them to submit a plan to the secretary--
1991.90-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.847,1686.501,And you don't claim the secretary made a mistake in approving the plan?
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1686.501,1687.818,--That's not our--
1991.90-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.818,1688.786,Just yes or no.
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1688.786,1689.453,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.453,1689.87,All right.
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1689.87,1694.79,The question today is whether or not the defendants have lived up to their obligations under the plan.
1991.90-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1694.79,1699.309,So we take the case on the assumption that the plan is reasonable?
1991.90-1488,1,35677,michael_g_dsida,,1699.309,1700.594,That the plan is reasonable?
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3309.746,3310.896,Three brief points.
1991.90-1488,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3348.571,3352.423,Would that reallocation involve State money as distinguished from Federal money?
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3352.423,3363.464,"--Yes, it would because the statute, although it's not in the record as a factual matter, the statute itself in sections 672 and 674 makes specific what title IV-E reimbursement is available."
1991.90-1488,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.605,3375.888,"Ms. Tchen, I really don't understand this argument."
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3386.746,3390.215,"No, I think... I am not arguing that, but I am arguing--"
1991.90-1488,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.215,3391.817,So what relevance does that have?
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3392.133,3416.015,"--What relevance it has is that in fact in the secretary's regulations, the secretary made the decision not to implement, not to promulgate a mandatory regulation that said, States, you must do this, this and this to comply with reasonable efforts, because in promulgating that regulation, the secretary said that the difficult decisions of how to allocate scarce resources and State resources in this area must be left to the States."
1991.90-1488,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.906,3427.706,--May I ask this question?
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3435.762,3448.486,"In the instance, in section 672 where there is individual determinations delegated specifically by Congress to the States, we believe it is a matter of the States looking at their individual case law, how they weigh best interests of the child--"
1991.90-1488,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3448.486,3451.688,"Your answer is, as the Chief Justice said, sometimes you can give a short answer--"
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3451.688,3454.288,--I think it's the State law--
1991.90-1488,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.288,3456.906,--so you think you it's a question of... the meaning of these words in this Federal statute is a question of State law?
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3456.906,3457.842,--Defers to the States.
1991.90-1488,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.408,3460.71,"No, not just deference, ultimately."
1991.90-1488,2,20189,christina_m_tchen,,3460.71,3467.197,"--Ultimately, section 672, we believe, gives that decision to the States."
1991.90-1488,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.647,3468.18,"Thank you, Ms. Tchen."
