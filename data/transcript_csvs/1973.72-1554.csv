1973.72-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.373,"We will hear arguments next in 72-1554, Super Tire Engineering against McCorkle."
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,57.294,60.627,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,246.518,249.81,"Mr. Cohen, suppose we agree with you and it is not moot, what do we do with it?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,249.81,252.087,"I think you should decide it, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.557,253.556,They did not decide it below.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,254.282,256.089,"Well, there are several reasons."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,266.208,267.552,That do not overstate it.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,267.552,269.574,"Well, I do not think I am overstating it."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.974,271.425,"Well, that may be the --"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,271.425,272.012,That is the first --
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.012,273.394,Best argument for remanding it.
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.394,274.47,Yes.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,274.47,280.953,"And it is also a case that, I submit, you do not have to have a record apart from what is already present to decide."
1973.72-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,304.068,310.036,Have you cited any case to us in which this case has taken that route that you are now suggesting?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,310.036,321.713,"This court has decided cases where, in the interest of economy, it felt the record was complete enough to decide it even though if the lower court has found no jurisdiction."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.137,337.835,"Can you tell me, Mr. Cohen, are the New Jersey statute or a statute, whatever it is, is that a counterpart precisely of similar statutes in other states?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,337.835,343.923,"The New Jersey state statute, the General Assistance Program, has a counterpart in every state in the United States."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.271,347.348,I am speaking of welfare payments to strikers.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,347.348,350.18,"Yes, well, there are three statutes involved in the case."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.452,365.122,"In every other state, the strikers --"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,365.122,366.218,Under every state --
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.218,366.588,Get payments under that?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,366.588,371.283,"Under that program, that is a state program, most of the states are divided."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.101,423.935,"And yet you suggest, despite these differences, that --"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,423.935,424.992,"Well, I think the principle is whether --"
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.992,428.567,"If we decide this, it is going to be of national --"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,428.567,440.595,I think what the principle that needs to be decided is whether the states can pay welfare under the -- whether it is to people engaged in any form of economic pressure which is permissible under federal law.
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.481,757.348,"Mr. Cohen, if you are challenging a New Jersey state regulation, does not the New Jersey Court system not provide some way for challenging that through a system of administrative appeal and then go to the courts?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,757.348,762.124,"Well, the challenge to New Jersey -- it is not like unemployment compensation."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.872,791.646,But a typical state administrative procedure act will provide that a regulation can be challenged just on a declaratory judgment type of basis.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,791.646,802.367,"The challenge here would have been, whether there is such a procedure I am not sure, but the challenge in this case would have resulted -- there has been a decision by the New Jersey department that administers the law."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.473,810.191,"Well, why can you not take that to the New Jersey courts?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,810.191,822.455,"I suppose we could take it to the New Jersey courts, but the New Jersey courts would not be in position to agree with us that what we are challenging here, I suppose I could, is a violation of a federal right."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.455,825.128,"They are sworn to uphold the federal constitution too, are they not?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,825.128,828.945,"That is right, but that is not our exclusive form."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.227,844.394,"Well, your mootness argument then really is that when we are talking about evading review and that sort of a thing."
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,851.7,856.601,"Well, presumably, if it is moot in the federal court, it would be moot in the state courts as well."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.601,865.88,"I would think, if you recall the Dorimas case some years ago in this court, the Supreme Court of New Jersey apparently has different rules as to mootness than we have."
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,865.88,873.47,"Well, this court has said on occasion that mootness of a preemption issue is a federal question."
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.994,1049.711,"Mr. Cohen, in Moore against Ogilvie, which you cite, had the case been deemed moot from the beginning by the lower courts or had it become moot between the time of the lower decision and in this court’s proposed decision?"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1049.711,1051.975,It was certainly moot before it reached this court.
1973.72-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.975,1073.716,"Is that not somewhat different than to say that Moore against Ogilvie, in effect, protects this court’s right to review a recurring problem when the lower courts have decided it in a concrete non-moot context as opposed to what you are asking here which is basically that you start out in the Federal District Court, your court of first jurisdiction with something that may already be moot."
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1073.716,1075.429,"No, that is not what we have here."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.349,1178.113,There is one more thing on the --
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1178.113,1178.837,Sure.
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.837,1179.876,On mootness.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1181.375,1186.197,"No, this was welfare assistance, state and joint federal-state welfare assistance."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.197,1191.176,Does the same argument about it arise out of other unemployment --
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1191.176,1193.575,The same mootness argument would arise.
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.354,1196.523,How about the same preemption case?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1196.523,1198.739,The same preemption argument was raised in Grinnell.
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.627,1213.332,This is a different mootness argument.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1213.332,1218.063,"No, I do not think it is because in each case in Grinnell -- the ITT involved welfare."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.607,1226.22,"Yes but if you can pay it, then you certainly have a stake in what your rate is going to be of continuing state --"
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1226.22,1230.393,"That is right, except in Grinnell, it was not directly charged to the employer."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.393,1231.934,This does not involve that.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1231.934,1232.833,This involves welfare.
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.739,1364.421,How generous are the state generals?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1364.421,1377.123,"Well the estimate, according to the expert testimony that is contained in the Appendix, is they run anywhere from 30-70% and maybe even higher in cases of a pre-strike take home pay for strikers."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1379.089,1380.587,How about New Jersey?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1380.587,1384.967,"In New Jersey, the record does not contain any evidence."
1973.72-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1399.114,1400.561,Pretty absolute stake.
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1400.561,1402.23,"Well, this is not uncommon."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.71,1498.962,Do you object to welfare employees who are locked out?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1498.962,1514.037,"I think that as long as the employees are engaged in a federally protected activity, it was a permissible lock up, then they ought not to get welfare assistance and ought not to get any state help."
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.713,1558.251,The AFDC is not operative in --
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1558.251,1558.963,That is correct.
1973.72-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.963,1560.314,Did New Jersey withdraw?
1973.72-1554,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1560.314,1567.978,"New Jersey withdrew it from the HEW program of the AFDC, the one that benefits were payable under here."
1973.72-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1584.348,1587.931,Very well.
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1590.384,1593.87,"Your Honors, we represent the respondent Teamsters Local Union."
1973.72-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.988,1712.96,"What do you have to say about Mr. Cohen’s argument that by definition, a striker is refusing to take available work and it is therefore, under New Jersey law, automatically ineligible for New Jersey welfare relief?"
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1712.96,1718.9,"If Your Honor please, I am going to refer to my co-counsel, the Deputy Attorney General, who will get into the merits of it."
1973.72-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.061,1835.216,Do you say all the employer has to do is to wait for a good long strike?
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1835.216,1840.075,"Well, I think the employer has got to be personally affected by what is going on."
1973.72-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.893,1935.257,"Though, while doing that you would lose your favorable decision in the District Court."
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1935.257,1935.813,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1973.72-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.03,1939.783,"Well, it was vacated."
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1939.783,1944.939,The decision below was vacated in the District Court and a new order was told to be entered by the District Court.
1973.72-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.939,1945.834,In this --
1973.72-1554,1,40135,robert_o’brien,,1945.834,1947.742,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.283,1987.959,Mr. Skillma.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,1987.959,1991.885,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.001,2012.894,What is the state’s view on the mootness issue?
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2012.894,2016.563,"Your Honor, the state is in a somewhat anomalous position on --"
1973.72-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.563,2019.774,Do you say it is moot or not?
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2019.774,2032.875,"We would say that if our analysis of the merits of the case is correct, that you look to the -- I do not mean ultimately on the merits but I mean, as to what you look to, the general legislative history."
1973.72-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.794,2045.569,"You do not represent them, do you?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2045.569,2053.713,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, the state officials, the Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies, and the Director of the Division of Public Welfare."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2082.339,2085.199,"Mr. Skillman, you may continue."
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2085.199,2087.286,May it please the Court.
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2286.393,2298.228,"Have there been any practice in New Jersey, before New Jersey withdrew from AFDC, on payments in such versions like this under AFDC?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2298.228,2312.371,"Your Honor, it is my understanding that it is difficult to piece this fact before ’57 which is the day of the regulation in question here but it is my understanding, that New Jersey under the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs has never disqualified strikers."
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2312.371,2314.108,It never goes back therefore --
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2314.108,2320.094,"Never, I assume back to 1935, but my source of knowledge is --"
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2320.094,2324.079,My recollection is not that.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2324.079,2334.774,"My source of knowledge, as I say, is internal agency memoranda from the middle 1950s which indicate that that was the case with respect to the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs."
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.774,2336.164,That is the middle 1950s?
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2336.164,2342.612,"That is the date of the memoranda which, I must say, are my only vision of what occurred prior to the middle 50's."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2381.698,2413.74,"Mr. Skillman, Mr. Cohen in his presentation suggested that, by definition, a striker was ineligible under New Jersey statutes because New Jersey limited payments to a person who was ready to accept work, if that work was available and, again by definition, a striker is rejecting work which is available, what do you have to say about that in terms of the New Jersey statute?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2413.74,2434.74,"Your Honor, first of all with respect to New Jersey’s participation in the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs which is the main part of this case we are, of course required to abide by federal requirements and not by state requirements except to the extent that the state may have the option to augment or supplement federal requirements."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.643,2464.119,"Well, who fits in this “other than”?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2470.871,2481.665,"No, all the statute says is that anyone who applies for categorical assistance or general assistance must be ready to seek and accept employment."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2481.665,2482.042,Yes.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2494.457,2499.575,"Well, he is refusing to work for one particular employer."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2506.639,2507.812,All I am trying to get at it.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2512.734,2514.735,I do not think that it is an exception.
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.953,2529.663,But what is New Jersey’s position on that?
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2529.663,2540.596,New Jersey’s position on that is that the striker may be called upon to seek and accept employment with an employer other than the employer from whom he is on strike.
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.596,2542.729,We are going around in a circle.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2550.767,2552.763,I think that all the statutes says --
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2552.763,2554.941,That he must accept work if available.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2554.941,2555.348,That is correct.
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.348,2561.407,"And he is declining to accept work which is available with his regular employer, is he not?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2561.407,2567.403,"That is correct, with his regular employer but not generally refusing to accept employment."
1973.72-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2567.403,2578.537,"Well each time you come back, and I am still unenlightened, you read an exception into the statute for the particular employer who has been struck."
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2583.294,2604.716,"Well, the position has to be that the employee is permitted not to go back to work with that particular employer and I think that the foundation for that position by the State of New Jersey, itself draws sustenance from the National Labor Relations Act."
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.716,2606.384,"Well, this has to mean, I gather it."
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2625.588,2629.673,That is correct as a matter of --
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2629.673,2640.188,I would be interested to -- is this a matter of administrative interpretation of the requirement or is there a New Jersey court decision that says this?
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2640.188,2643.886,"There is no court decision on this point, Your Honor."
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.544,2684.104,"Did I understand you, Mr. Skillman, to say that New Jersey did disqualify them, at least insofar as the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs are concerned, New Jersey would violate the provisions of the federal requirements?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2684.104,2691.985,"Well, the federal requirements are quite similar with respect to an individual being willing to accept work so I would say, no."
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.985,2700.479,"That is what I thought, so that New Jersey could disqualify him because he refused to accept work without violating any federal statute?"
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2700.479,2700.986,That is correct.
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.986,2711.124,So that there would be no conflict at all between the federal welfare laws and the labor laws if he was disqualified.
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2711.124,2718.357,"No, but that has not been the focus of --"
1973.72-1554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2718.357,2720.22,Well --
1973.72-1554,2,42073,stephen_skillman,,2720.22,2721.538,--of this case.
1973.72-1554,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3497.191,3504.338,I would like to spend those four minutes I think trying to unravel some of the confusion which Mr. Skillman perhaps left the court with.
1973.72-1554,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3518.021,3524.103,"Now, in light of Mr. Skillman, I thought he said the main part of this case was the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs?"
1973.72-1554,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3524.103,3525.217,That is where he is wrong.
1973.72-1554,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3525.217,3525.943,I see.
1973.72-1554,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3525.943,3530.626,The strikers did not receive benefits in any substantial amount.
1973.72-1554,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3606.449,3608.883,He said that HEW has agreed with that.
1973.72-1554,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3608.883,3614.243,HEW said “we will approve any state program whether it pays strikers or it does not pay strikers.”
