2019.18-1023,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.48,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1023, Maine Community Health Options versus United States, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement."
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,10.48,55.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a massive government bait-and-switch and the fundamental question of whether the government has to keep its word after its money-mandating promises have induced reliance. The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there is nothing to repeal."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,221.16,231.28,"What if they had been included in the original legislation? If the appropriations riders had been included in the original legislation, would that make a difference?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,231.28,256.32,"Well, ultimately, I don't think it would make a difference in the sense that I think it's a little hard to -- to figure out exactly what that would look like. And I think the reason you didn't have appropriation riders in the 2010 legislation is because, for this part of the policy, the policies wouldn't be offered until 2014 and you really wouldn't be in a position to know whether or not there was an obligation until 2015."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,256.32,271.08,"But what if the law said the government shall pay and the money shall come from the premiums, but it may not come from the only other identified source that could be used to pay?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,271.08,302.48,"So, Justice Alito, I think if they tried to do that ex ante in 2014, that I think people would say -- that would be sufficiently strange that I think people would say, well, what exactly do you mean by that? And I think there probably would have been a clarification before anybody relied. But, of course, back in 2010, there was none of that kind of language whatsoever, and you had what, I think, anybody would recognize as a clear money-mandating promise that the government shall pay certain obligations."
2019.18-1023,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.76,330.88,"Mr. Clement, you are relying on what you call an implied damages action based on 1342, but this Court has been reluctant to imply any right of action, has insisted on Congress providing the right of action."
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,340.56,346.92,"Well, ultimately, we think it is, Justice Ginsburg, but it has to be inferred from the money-mandating promise itself."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,417.08,417.6,"Well, what is the --"
2019.18-1023,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,417.6,417.8,Are there any --
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,417.8,438.04,"-- what is the difference between a statutory provision that says a person shall have some non-monetary right and a statutory provision that says a -- an entity, a company, shall be paid? Why should we be more willing to infer a cause of action in the latter situation than in the -- in the former?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,438.04,439.76,"Well, I -- I think --"
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,439.76,443.48,Because of special solicitude for insurance companies?
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,443.48,460.88,"Well, no, obviously not, Justice Alito, but I think, first of all, if you have the sort of ""shall do"" something other than pay money, you don't have to look for an implied cause of action because I think you would have a cause of action that would arise under the APA to enforce the particular whatever it was, ""shall"" fill in the blank."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,464.32,467.92,"No, no, a damages remedy for that."
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,467.92,476.32,"Well, I don't know that you would necessarily infer a damages remedy for that, but I think you would get very much the same thing under the APA."
2019.18-1023,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,510.24,522.64,"Are there any limits to that, Mr. Clement? Is the ""shall pay"" language sufficient in all cases no matter what the kind of program or entitlement or grant? Is -- is it just ""shall pay"" does it?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,522.64,553.56,"Well, I -- I think, Justice Kagan, if you look at the Federal Circuit's precedents on this, ""shall pay"" alone might not do it, but when you combine that with specific -- specificity about what amounts are going to be paid and to whom and under what circumstances, that's clearly sufficient for a money-mandating promise and it always has been. And, again, I think, if you think about this case in comparison to this Court's precedents involving Indian trust obligations, this is a much more specific and much more enforceable promise."
2019.18-1023,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,587.52,613.12,"You make a case at some length about the reliance of the insurance companies, they were basically seduced into this program, but they have good lawyers and the Constitution says no money shall come out of the Treasury except pursuant to an appropriations clause, and I would have thought at some point they would have sat down and said, well, why don't we insist upon an appropriations provision before we put ourselves on the hook for $12 billion?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,613.12,652.72,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think they -- they did have very good lawyers and they looked at this Court's precedents, they looked at the precedents of the Federal Circuit, and although those court cases all stand for the proposition that, obviously, Congress has the power of the purse, with all respect, they don't stand for the proposition that the only way that Congress can open the purse is by making a specific appropriation. It has long been the law recognized by this Court and by the government in its GAO red book, which is sort of the bible for these kind of things, that the government can obligate itself and Congress can obligate itself without using any magic words of appropriation."
2019.18-1023,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.56,693.8,"No, I know. But I think the reliance argument has to be taken at least subject to the qualification. Yeah, I understand your argument, but, if somebody raised their hand and said, hey, shouldn't we get an appropriations provision here, nobody would have said, well, you know, we don't need it because this is a money-mandating statute and this and this and this, and, you know, if something goes wrong, we can get Mr. Clement to go argue the case. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1023,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.8,701.28,It -- it strikes me that you do have the appropriations clause sitting out there and it's a pretty clear yellow light.
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,701.28,735.36,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's as clear as you think, because, look, the government's position is what we needed to do was include language in 2010 that said that this constitutes budget authority. But, of course, that would be subject to a subsequent Congress's amendment as well. So, for purposes of the retroactivity argument, I think what's important here is, in 2010, they made a money-mandating promise that I think anyone who looked at all the sources would say, that's good enough. Now could it be better? Could it have belt and suspenders? Sure, but it's good enough."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,785.84,789.88,Was there some other fund that could have been used?
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,789.88,802.92,I -- I -- I don't think that anybody readily identified another fund that would have been used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make the payments. But it's Black Letter Law that that doesn't make the obligation go away.
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,803.08,808.16,But wasn't this the only fund that was identified by the GAO as a potential source?
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,808.16,817.12,"Well, GAO, in its correspondence with two members of Congress, identified two sources of funds for the appropriations."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,841.32,841.6,But --
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,841.6,842.0,So --
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,842.0,845.36,-- you've now had an opportunity to study this in detail.
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,851.84,880.64,"I can't, Justice Alito. And that's a problem for why the Secretary of Health and Human Services can't voluntarily make the payments without violating the Antideficiency Act. But what happens in that situation -- and this Court made this absolutely clear in the Ramah decision -- is when there is insufficient funds for an executive branch officer to make a payment under which the United States is obligated, then they can't make the payment voluntarily."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,913.48,928.8,"But do you think it would be reasonable for the insurance companies to say: Look, we know that Congress is now refusing to appropriate any money to pay us, but don't worry, we'll sue later and we'll get the money, billions of dollars, from the Judgment Fund?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,928.8,938.8,"Justice Alito, at the time that they're first being told that the government's not going to pay in 2014, late 2014, it's already too late for 2014."
2019.18-1023,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1008.76,1009.16,The government --
2019.18-1023,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.16,1011.12,Why isn't this a contract?
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1011.12,1014.44,"I think it very much operates like a contract, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-1023,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.44,1015.8,"Yeah, but why isn't it one?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1015.8,1017.6,"Well, we -- we're saying it is."
2019.18-1023,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.28,1021.96,Is there some authority that says this isn't a contract?
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1021.96,1023.56,"No, I don't, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-1023,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.0,1055.16,Mister --
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1055.16,1056.16,-- obligation that can be enforced.
2019.18-1023,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.16,1059.32,"-- Mr. Clement, the problem was that Justice Scalia was in dissent."
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1066.44,1073.36,"Well, it's easy to, Justice Sotomayor, because the majority did not actually disagree with him on this point."
2019.18-1023,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1099.64,1105.76,So give me a one- or two-sentence distinguishing of that case from this one.
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1114.48,1114.96,Yes.
2019.18-1023,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1115.76,1117.08,"Or both statutes had the ""shall"" --"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1117.08,1117.24,Right.
2019.18-1023,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1318.32,1329.6,"Is it possible to think of those cases as -- as -- as cases we shouldn't rely on to the extent we usually do because -- because of the Judgment Fund? In other words, we live in a different world now?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1329.6,1336.88,"No, absolutely not, Justice Kagan, because what happened in those cases is even before the Judgment Fund, there were judgments."
2019.18-1023,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1460.68,1475.84,"Has there ever been a case where this Court has, in effect, required Congress to appropriate, through the Judgment Fund or in any other way, billions of dollars for private businesses?"
2019.18-1023,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1475.84,1489.2,"Well, look, I -- I don't -- I mean, if -- it's a contract case, but, if you cut right down to it and you adjust for inflation, I would think Winstar got you into the billions of dollars as well. And I think Winstar is another good example, although it was conceived of as a contracting case."
2019.18-1023,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1515.16,1521.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1521.08,1530.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Chief Justice has said, the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution is central to this case."
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.72,1661.76,You can explain it --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1661.76,1662.76,-- which is patterned after it.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.76,1667.16,-- in simple terms. Day one of contracts.
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1682.64,1683.2,It didn't --
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.2,1685.16,And if it -- if it didn't differ.
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1725.2,1727.64,The -- the answer is that this is not a contract.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.64,1729.52,Why not?
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1729.52,1730.2,This -- this Court --
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1730.2,1731.56,"Well, I mean, it's pretty close."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1732.72,1733.36,I think it's --
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.36,1739.72,"Why isn't it either a contract or close enough? It says ""shall pay."" If you climb the pole, we'll pay."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1741.32,1743.56,It's very far from a contract.
2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1777.16,1777.48,So is --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1777.48,1777.88,-- the language --
2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1777.88,1785.36,"-- is every congressional promise to pay, therefore, subject to an implicit subject to appropriations caveat?"
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1785.36,1788.48,"I -- I believe by and large that that is correct, yes."
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.48,1798.36,"How did we decide Winstar? I -- I remember staying here until July and somebody over the government had promised all those banks that if they did dah, dah, dah, they'd get paid about a billion dollars."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1798.36,1798.92,And those were --
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.92,1799.6,"And they did do dah, dah, dah."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1799.6,1802.56,And those were -- those promises were based on contracts.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.24,1823.36,All the --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1823.36,1823.8,-- economy.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.8,1829.12,"-- all the statutes that say, I don't know, but it seems to me there must be a lot and I haven't looked it up."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1850.0,1850.24,"No, it --"
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.24,1851.6,It's not a contract? I mean --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1851.6,1852.2,"No, it is --"
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.2,1853.72,-- I don't know how this works.
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1853.72,1855.0,-- it is -- it is definitely not a contract.
2019.18-1023,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.12,1900.4,But it didn't --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1900.4,1902.56,-- and tells you what money can be -- can be paid.
2019.18-1023,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1902.56,1914.88,"-- it didn't -- it didn't repeal the ""shall pay."" In fact, there were bills to repeal, and there weren't sufficient votes in Congress to repeal."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1945.8,1950.36,"No, I -- I -- I don't think there's any indication they didn't have the votes."
2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1974.52,1996.72,"I -- I -- I vaguely recall the government arguing on several occasions that unenacted bills are entitled to some weight in the interpretation process, but you don't question that these insurance companies would not have participated in the risk corridor program but for the government's promise to pay?"
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1996.72,2001.32,"I -- I don't -- well, it's not about participating in the risk corridor program."
2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.6,2014.88,Well --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2014.88,2017.28,-- whom would get -- would get tax subsidies.
2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.28,2021.0,-- customers who otherwise were largely uninsurable.
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2021.0,2021.44,Yes.
2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.6,2025.2,"Well, that's no great business opportunity for them."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2025.2,2034.04,"Oh -- oh, no, it -- it is, because Congress provided tax credits to subsidize the -- the -- the persons who -- who purchased insurance on the exchanges."
2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2034.04,2037.12,"No, it's a good business opportunity for them because the government promised to pay."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2037.12,2040.6,"Well, it's a good -- it's a good opportunity for the insurance companies."
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2046.68,2046.8,Are you saying --
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2046.8,2047.48,-- a number of things working together --
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2047.48,2052.4,-- that the insurance companies would have done the same thing with or without this promise to pay?
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2052.4,2058.12,I -- I don't think we know what they -- I think -- I -- I -- I don't think that they would have declined to participate.
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2062.0,2062.44,Okay.
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2065.56,2066.04,"Well, it --"
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2066.04,2077.24,"I mean, the government -- the Congress that passed this provision wanted to keep the premiums down, didn't it? And so it induced a certain kind of reliance --"
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2077.24,2077.48,"Well, it -- it -- it --"
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2077.48,2078.48,-- on the part of the insurers.

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2163.16,2163.64,That's correct.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.64,2164.2,All right.

But that doesn't mean Congress has made -- has created a vested right in them. Again, I want to come back to the Amtrak case and -- and -- and referring back to the Dodge case as the canonical statement, and that is that an act -- that a statute, an act of Congress, absent clear indications, is not construed to create a contract and is not construed to create vested rights."

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2380.8,2396.16,"Well, we had -- we have an example -- I mean, tellingly, in this case, we have an example in the Part D Medicare risk corridors provision in which Congress -- Congress in 1342, for this risk corridor program, said base this one upon that one."
2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2405.12,2406.0,But Mr. Clement --

2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2407.12,2415.36,"-- Mr. Clement says that there are also many provisions that say, in essence, ""shall pay"" subject to appropriations."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2415.36,2415.96,"Well, the --"
2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2415.96,2429.76,"In other words, Congress knows how to prevent the obligation from being -- from taking effect before the future appropriation and, in fact, does so often and did so in the Affordable Care Act."
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2429.76,2464.88,"Well, in the Affordable Care Act, I -- I think it's -- I just want to point out to the Court, they -- they cite a handful of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, and they're -- they're almost all in specialized grant programs, but it's telling, if you look at them, the ones that are immediately adjacent to them which have parallel grant provisions and don't have this language. 42 U.S.C. 480(k) has this language that 2 -- immediately preceding it, 280(j)(3) and 280(k)(1) also grant programs and don't have it."
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2489.0,2492.68,"Well, I would think it's pretty clear what the ""subject to appropriations"" language does."

2019.18-1023,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2568.56,2577.04,"Okay, so the Secretary of the Treasury is going to be prosecuted criminally because of his interpretation of whether or not the funds were authorized?"
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2577.04,2586.4,"Well, I mean, it's a reasonable interpretation he's probably not going to be prosecuted, but -- but that is the way in which Congress has kept the power of the purse. One -- one other piece of --"
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2586.4,2592.4,But what does the Antideficiency Act have to do with Congress's own ability to commit itself?
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2592.4,2608.56,"The Antideficiency -- this is a statute that speaks -- 1342, as most ""shall pay"" statutes would, speaks to an agency. But that -- but when a -- when 1342 says pay -- first of all, it says the Secretary should set up a program under which the Secretary would pay."

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2725.28,2726.92,I think fundamental policies.
2019.18-1023,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2726.92,2727.16,What?
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2727.16,2729.16,First on the -- first on the contract side.
2019.18-1023,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2796.4,2796.76,If we --

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2826.68,2830.04,"Well, one of the problems is we don't know what -- what may be out there."

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2854.84,2855.4,-- that is the way Congress --

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2915.6,2923.28,"I -- I think that would be the general rule, but let me point out here, there -- there's no language of promise in this -- in this statute."

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2928.36,2935.4,"Well, it's an instruction to an agency to pay, but when you have an instruction to an agency to do anything, it is always conditioned --"

2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3048.84,3063.76,The -- and -- and that's why the compliance with the Constitution and compliance with a statutory framework is not a violation of law that gives rise to an implied damage remedy in the -- in the Court of Claims. And one other piece of the --
2019.18-1023,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3063.76,3073.88,"But you can't -- you can't say to me that Congress is not empowered to empower the Secretary to act. Congress can tell the Secretary to enter a contract, can't he?"
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3073.88,3102.24,"Yes, but if -- on that score, if I could just point out, 31 U.S.C. 1302(d), Congress, in implementing its control over appropriations, has itself adopted a rule of construction.

2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3104.92,3109.08,-- are -- are insurers obligated to pay in if they have excess profits?
2019.18-1023,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3109.08,3110.52,"Yes, it is a user fee."
2019.18-1023,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3110.52,3119.76,"So this is one where the ""shall pay in"" is obligatory but the ""shall pay out"" on the part of the government is not obligatory?"

That includes a subsidy program."

And I assure you, if one of my clients when presented with a bill said, well, we have a bunch of internal rules at our company and I actually can't disburse the funds until I get approval from the treasury division at our company, I don't think the government would be impressed by that and they certainly wouldn't say that the mandatory obligation just somehow disappeared because the rule said we didn't have the funds to pay it at that particular moment. I'd also like to talk about the ""subject to appropriations"" language because that's not just a feature of many other provisions of the Affordable Care Act."
