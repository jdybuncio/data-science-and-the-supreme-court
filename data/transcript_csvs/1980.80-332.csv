1980.80-332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.686,We'll hear arguments next in Rhodes v. Chapman.
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,74.595,79.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.632,111.049,I thought that the District Court at one point in its opinion says it was not holding that double-celling per se was unconstitutional?
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,111.049,111.612,That's true.
1980.80-332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.275,142.458,You say in effect that since he found nothing but double-celling as a disadvantage to the prisoners he must have held double-celling was unconstitutional?
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,142.458,149.081,"Well, he found a few other unrelated things not to be to his liking."
1980.80-332,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,160.967,171.712,"Mr. Adler, would you say that there are some inconsistencies in the district judge's discernment here?"
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,171.712,172.994,I definitely would.
1980.80-332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.887,282.683,"General Adler, can I ask you just a question about the facts for a moment, and the relief?"
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,299.833,300.348,That's correct.
1980.80-332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.22,313.17,"So we're kind of arguing... I understand the State still has an interest and it's not moot but it's kind of a theoretical problem now, I gather."
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,313.17,325.4,"Well, the inmate population of the State of Ohio since this case has been decided had gone up and not down, so we have more of a problem now on a statewide basis than we did at the time."
1980.80-332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.4,327.961,But not actually... but not in this particular institution?
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,332.788,333.225,That's correct.
1980.80-332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.106,366.586,"General Adler, actually, of course, it's the Court of Appeals' decision which we're reviewing, which is somewhat perfunctory."
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,403.243,408.85,I would much prefer if they would say either it's right or its wrong.
1980.80-332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.441,418.832,"Well, take this or any opinion you lose."
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,418.832,431.731,"--Well, in contrast with the recent opinion that came out of the State of Colorado, an opinion of the 10th Circuit that ran on for, I think, 80-some pages, this case was dealt with in less than a page and a half."
1980.80-332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.731,443.664,"Well, on that basis you might say that the 10th Circuit was 50 times as wrong?"
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,443.664,445.258,Possibly.
1980.80-332,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,445.258,451.021,"Mr. Adler, now that we have you interrupted, may I ask something?"
1980.80-332,0,15406,allen_p_adler,,494.644,498.549,"If my memory serves me, I don't believe--"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1616.035,1622.767,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.464,1646.303,"Now, do you think the Court of Appeals acted on the constitutional issue?"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1646.303,1651.364,"Yes, Your Honor, I think the Court of Appeals looked at the findings of fact, as was quoted earlier."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.364,1660.157,"Well, then why did the Court of Appeals say that they did not read the District Court as deciding the case on the constitutional basis?"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1660.157,1680.323,"I read the Court of Appeals to be saying that the District Court did not hold that double-celling per se was unconstitutional, but rather that under the specific factual findings made about conditions existing at that institution, the double-celling was unconstitutional and that the remedy of reducing population was therefore proper."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.323,1697.096,"In the language of its opinion in its penultimate paragraph, is the usual finding that we associate with Court of Appeals' opinions, finding no clear error."
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1703.172,1707.498,"No, Your Honor, totality of conditions test is a test--"
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.498,1708.733,"Well, is it constitutional or not?"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1717.807,1719.712,"--I think it did, Your Honor."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1733.955,1740.61,They said double-celling... the prohibition of double-celling was a reasonable response.
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1742.218,1768.427,"Your Honor, if all of the conditions at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility violate the Eight Amendment and a method of ending the constitutional violation is to reduce the population, then, yes, I would submit that this is exactly like Hutto v. Finney; that you're taking a series of unconstitutional conditions which together make an unconstitutional whole, taking the least possible intrusive remedies to make again a constitutional institution."
1980.80-332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.252,1799.211,"Mrs. Kamp, do you get the feeling from the penultimate sentence of the Court of Appeals' opinion saying that the findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are permissible, that, say, if this case had come up before Judge Rubin in Dayton and he had found exactly the same findings of fact but held there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Court of Appeals would have affirmed him?"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1799.211,1809.691,"I think, reading the 6th Circuit decision, they might well have."
1980.80-332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.818,1858.406,But then the penal systems of 50 different states are going to be subject to the views of 93 different district federal judges in 93 different districts.
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1858.406,1873.853,"No, Your Honor, because all of them have to reach the question of whether the Eight Amendment has been violated, which means a finding whether, under the totality of conditions, the plaintiffs have been able to show an unnecessary infliction of suffering or--"
1980.80-332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.853,1884.552,But you say it's an intensely fact-specific thing that one judge could come out one way and one on the other on precisely the same facts.
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1884.552,1887.879,"--Well, Your Honor, there could never be precisely the same facts."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1912.947,1925.238,"Well, Mrs. Kamp, if the trier, the original trier is looking at the totality or one specific conduct like, let us say, the hanging by the thumbs."
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1936.843,1938.577,"Yes, Your Honor, it's so."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.577,1946.418,"Well, what difference does it make whether he did it on totality or on a specific finding of one cruel punishment?"
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1946.418,1957.429,"Well, there are some punishments, we would submit, that are so cruel as to by themselves violate the Constitution, such as hanging by the thumbs, such as housing people in 14 square feet, as was mentioned earlier."
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1969.142,1972.938,"I hate to repeat it, but the Court of Appeals said that that's what he didn't find."
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,1987.307,1994.522,"Well, perhaps it would be helpful if I could talk about what the circumstances were that I think the trial judge relied on--"
1980.80-332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.522,1999.443,"Well, it's very important to us, what each of these courts held so we know what it is we're reviewing."
1980.80-332,1,31306,jean_p_kamp,,2015.843,2019.217,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3006.084,3007.661,"Just a few things, Your Honor."
1980.80-332,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.498,3028.902,Why would he have done that?
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3031.371,3033.134,If it's cruel and unusual punishment?
1980.80-332,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.134,3034.009,No.
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3034.009,3034.962,I think someone's got--
1980.80-332,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.962,3039.038,"Talking of conscience, is that the test under the cruel and unusual punishment?"
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3039.038,3039.757,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.80-332,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.958,3060.999,"Your understanding of the court of Appeals, then, was quite different from yours, because the Court of Appeals begins its short per curiam opinion with a statement that the trial court did find certain conditions at a state prison that violate the Eight Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment."
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3066.731,3076.336,"That is what the Court of Appeals stated, but again, nowhere in Judge Hogan's opinion does he find anything that shocks his conscience or that he considers barbarous treatment."
1980.80-332,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3078.819,3098.155,"The Court of Appeals order... or per curiam, however it's characterized... doubles back on itself about fifteen lines later, and that is at least a partial contradiction of its earlier hints about the Eight Amendment."
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3098.155,3101.497,That's true; very true.
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.255,3164.628,"Mr. Adler, let me ask you a question about, supposing you win this case and we say, on the record before us none of these things have been shown."
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3178.81,3183.168,"--I would hope so, as long as they could prove no harm has resulted."
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.744,3188.4,Now say they do it in six months.
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3200.959,3202.646,--I assume that it would be a whole new case.
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.646,3209.627,"And I suppose it is possible that the longer these conditions persist, the greater risk you have that that might actually happen?"
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3209.627,3211.33,Yes.
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.454,3217.577,"It's two years, I know, but they're talking about... these are people who may be in for a good deal longer."
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3217.577,3224.058,"Coming at this question from the other end, that institution, as I stated before, since August of 1979 we've been down to that 1,645."
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.354,3230.727,In other words--
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3230.727,3231.946,And there's a slight increase in one area.
1980.80-332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.946,3233.961,--There's an irony in litigation of this kind.
1980.80-332,2,15406,allen_p_adler,,3240.474,3246.378,"I've talked to prison administrators in other states and they feel the same way you do, although I can't say that of ours."
1980.80-332,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.205,3327.594,"Thank you, counsel."
