1986.85-1129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,73.429,"You may proceed whenever you're ready, Ms. Brooks."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,73.429,76.564,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,170.843,191.756,"Well, if a statistical imbalance in the work force is evident and the adopt an affirmative action plan, isn't it apparent on its face that its remedial in the sense they're trying to remedy the imbalance?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,191.756,197.76,"Your Honor, they can only remedy that imbalance if in fact it is the result of discrimination."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,198.729,207.718,So you say just statistical imbalance will never justify by itself an affirmative action?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,207.718,212.539,"--I don't believe that it should, and let me explain why."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.25,234.285,What else was there in Weber?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,234.285,237.154,I beg your pardon?
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.804,239.939,Beyond an imbalance?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,239.939,253.413,"This Court took judicial notice that you had had other findings of discrimination against the same employer and the same union, and again it found that the plan itself was sufficiently narrow to justify it."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.996,262.518,You think in Weber the plan adopted was to remedy past discrimination?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,262.518,265.97,"--This Court... yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.196,305.428,"Do you agree that if the employer has a firm basis for believing remedial action is necessary, because otherwise the employer is likely to be subject to some action against the employer under Title 7, that that justifies or can justify taking affirmative action?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,305.428,306.88,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.556,324.74,All right.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,329.227,329.96,Yes.
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.96,333.162,"Totaling what, 278 or so?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,333.162,333.629,238.
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.629,334.781,238.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,334.781,335.381,Yes.
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.381,337.316,None of which were occupied by women.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,337.316,338.233,Yes.
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.233,347.171,And you think that is not enough for the employer to think that there might be a firm basis here?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,347.171,360.848,"In this case no, because, first of all, on the face of the plan and the testimony in the trial, it was conceded that the reason you had zero there was societal and attitudinal, and net necessarily discrimination."
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.368,400.74,What evidence... or what is the evidence in the record as to the percentage of qualified women in the labor pool for these positions?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,400.74,408.412,"Your Honor, when the agency developed its program and when this case was tried there was no evidence of what the relevant labor pool was."
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.505,429.057,And the goal that the employer set was only five percent?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,429.057,429.74,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.601,451.072,That's the goal on which we have to test this case?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,454.857,459.143,"Certainly with respect to what happened to the Petitioner, there's no question they didn't have any short term goals."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.612,697.646,Let me just ask you another question here.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,729.051,737.073,"Your Honor, on these facts I'd have to say yes, because already we have women actively in the work force."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.291,742.575,"You're saying promotions always have to be made on merit, then?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,742.575,753.249,"I think that once you've opened the doors and provided for equal opportunity, it's appropriate to have these employees moving up through the work force based on the merit system."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.249,753.832,I agree it's appropriate.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,757.284,760.034,In the absence of--
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.034,762.252,In the absence of any proof of Past discrimination.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,762.252,764.854,"--Convincing evidence, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.854,769.425,And why would the past discrimination change the picture?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,777.579,803.229,"Your Honor, I think that the reason that it would make a different to have past discrimination is because we're trying to achieve a reconciliation between the protection that Title 7 provides for individual rights and the recognized need to promote voluntary compliance and to achieve the purposes of Title 7, which is equal opportunity, and to make people whole if they have suffered discrimination."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.848,808.817,"You think Weber, the Weber case, requires proof of past discrimination?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,808.817,814.887,"--The Weber case... yes, the Weber case had evidence of past discrimination."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.53,935.648,May I just ask again.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,949.006,955.876,"Well, Your Honor, this is just in case you were to find that there was an adequate remedial purpose based solely on these statistics."
1986.85-1129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.876,957.245,"Based on statistics, I see."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,957.245,962.466,"And again, we think that that should not be enough, and especially upon the facts of this case."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.38,1013.732,A promotion is involved in this case.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1013.732,1014.532,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.532,1015.601,How about a hire?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1028.741,1030.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.124,1032.276,--just because he wants to?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1032.276,1033.126,No.
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.732,1045.203,So you would make the same argument with respect to a hiring goal?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1045.203,1049.238,"--Yes, but I think that the latter aspect goes to the tailoring aspect."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.678,1064.748,"Yes, but you nevertheless would say that just because the employer wants to isn't enough."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1064.748,1066.533,--That's absolutely correct.
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.533,1068.166,And just because there's a racial imbalance isn't enough.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1068.166,1069.651,"No, it shouldn't be."
1986.85-1129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1078.257,1080.976,"Ms. Brooks, I want to be very sure."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1088.363,1092.434,The first answer... there are a number of answers.
1986.85-1129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1103.123,1103.806,You meant private?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1103.806,1104.373,--Pardon?
1986.85-1129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1104.373,1105.473,You said public.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1105.473,1106.658,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1986.85-1129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1111.21,1113.478,But you say that isn't really a very good distinction?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1113.478,1118.966,"Well, I think it begs your question because you can always extend Weber to a public employer."
1986.85-1129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.456,1195.097,"Ms. Brooks, you're at pains not to require the employer to come in and confess that he's been discriminating in the past, but I just wonder how secure your assurance is."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1219.129,1222.664,I think there are a number of answers to that.
1986.85-1129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.551,1257.951,"No, just that he may have been discriminating."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1257.951,1258.42,Exactly.
1986.85-1129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.42,1259.003,Right.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1259.003,1260.403,But I think that that's necessary.
1986.85-1129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.403,1260.92,But no employer's going to like to do that.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1266.074,1272.728,"Well, Your Honor, no person may not be able to do it, but Title 7 says that you cannot discriminate against your employees."
1986.85-1129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.346,1282.434,It does seem to me to put the employer between a rock and a hard place.
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1293.641,1302.83,"The kind of evidence that we're talking about... and again, this is only some ideas... would be to look at the statistics and give a careful scrutiny to the statistics."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.066,1403.66,What would you say the prevailing law is or was in the lower courts with respect to whether racial imbalance alone would make out a prima facie case under Title 7?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1403.66,1413.432,"I think if you're a Title 7 case... Title 7 plaintiff, excuse me, I don't think there's any question that that is a prima facie case."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.848,1419.668,"Well, how about if you're just a court?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1419.668,1420.951,--Okay.
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.951,1424.37,Not the plaintiff but what about--
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1424.37,1426.322,The prevailing law is--
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.322,1436.595,"--The plaintiff gets through with his case or her case and the only proof is racial imbalance, and there's a motion to dismiss."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1436.595,1446.236,"--Then that would be denied, Your Honor, because statistical imbalances, if there's no explanation, do establish a case."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.78,1473.886,"Well, if that makes out a prima facie case in a Title 7 case, just racial imbalance, what's the employer then... how can he win the case?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1479.957,1494.384,"The employer can come forward with a number of explanations, and particularly I believe this Court held in the Cooper case that you can explain the statistical imbalance my reasons other than no discrimination."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.97,1519.499,"Well, what if the employer who has a racially imbalanced work force asks his attorney, if I am sued... he says there's a racially imbalanced work force and it would survive a motion to dismiss in a Title 7 suit."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1521.717,1522.3,"Yes, and that's precisely--"
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.3,1522.717,"--No, wait a minute."
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1522.717,1523.367,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.367,1533.941,Should I also ask you what are the chances of the plaintiff winning?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1539.762,1550.117,And that's exactly why having the employer consider statistical imbalances and look for explanations and then take a remedy before he gets sued would solve the problem.
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.986,1556.454,Did you just give away your case or not?
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1556.454,1562.758,"No, I don't think we gave away our case at all, because here the agency never did that kind of a process."
1986.85-1129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.698,1574.935,"You mean it never asked, might I lose a Title 7 case?"
1986.85-1129,0,18444,constance_e_brooks,,1574.935,1579.387,--The agency has claimed that they would.
1986.85-1129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.992,1590.027,"Thank you, Ms. Brooks."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1592.563,1595.765,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.679,1621.297,Now you're putting some other facts in the question.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1624.13,1626.332,"--Very well, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.639,1642.46,And you think that just regularly in the district courts that evidence would survive?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1642.46,1644.743,A motion to dismiss?
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.578,1648.53,But it would not mean that the employer would necessarily lose the case?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1648.53,1650.68,It would not mean that the employer would necessarily lose.
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.79,1677.863,"Well, so but you think the employer should not only... shouldn't adopt a policy just based on racial imbalance, but that he should say, have I got a good chance of actually losing the case?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1677.863,1687.405,"No, I believe that if there is evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination, that that's enough for an employer to consider."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.405,1689.038,"Well, that means just racial imbalance."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1689.038,1690.857,"That means racial imbalance, that's right."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.857,1697.927,"He needn't go on and say, well, I think I can still win because I have a neutral explanation?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1697.927,1701.546,"Well, as I tried to make clear with the facts of this case--"
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.546,1703.531,"Well, I know, but forget these facts."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1703.531,1703.981,--Right.
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.981,1715.322,Do you think the employer need not go on and say that I do or I don't have a neutral explanation?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1715.322,1716.674,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1726.363,1737.671,"What if the employer knows that no woman has ever applied for any of these jobs, that it's just the kind of job that for some reason women in that area have not applied for?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1737.671,1738.704,I think that would be a--
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.704,1742.156,Is that something the employer must weigh in addition to statistics?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1742.156,1745.524,--I don't think it's required that the employer must weigh that.
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1754.546,1756.463,"Well, who's going to know if the employer doesn't?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1760.367,1761.15,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.591,1777.393,"Well, then it really boils down to the burden of proof in a sense, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1785.063,1790.365,"--I think that's correct, given those limited facts and the limited hypothetical that Justice O'Connor has--"
1986.85-1129,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1790.365,1790.967,Mr. Woodside--
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1790.967,1791.651,--Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1791.651,1799.987,--I was under the impression that the district court found that there had never been any discrimination against women by the agency and that none was occurring at the time of trial.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1799.987,1803.356,"That, Your Honor, was not a litigated issue in the case."
1986.85-1129,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1803.356,1804.574,It did make that finding?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1804.574,1806.743,The district court judge did make that finding.
1986.85-1129,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1806.743,1809.862,Did the Court of Appeals hold it clearly erroneous?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1809.862,1812.48,"No, the Court of Appeals did not hold that clearly erroneous."
1986.85-1129,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1812.48,1814.23,So you rely solely on the statistics?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1814.23,1818.016,"I rely on the statistics, as well as evidence of other practices."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.345,1841.297,But don't we have to accept the findings as they come to us?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1841.297,1842.499,"Yes, Your Honor, you do."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.513,1871.436,Would you clarify for me what the affirmative action plan consisted of?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1893.949,1895.884,"It actually has elements of both, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.631,1928.939,"So you concede, then, that this employer affirmative action plan was not geared to the number of qualified women in the pool of labor?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1928.939,1947.584,"No, Your Honor, I don't concede that, because the next step and probably the most important step in our plan, is that after those overall goals were set the plan further requires that specific goals be thereafter set for individual jobs, such as skilled crafts."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.273,1959.073,Where do we find that?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1973.782,1978.686,The agency's goal is contained in the 1982 plan.
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1978.686,1983.888,Is that in the appendix someplace?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1983.888,1984.856,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1984.856,1985.706,Where would I find it?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1986.44,1986.99,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.99,1988.975,Don't take your argument time.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,1990.494,1992.027,It is in the joint appendix and it is cited.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.015,2007.003,Was that the goal that was applied when Mr. Johnson was denied his promotion?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2007.003,2009.805,There was at that time no specific goal for skilled crafts.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.805,2012.49,So at that time they were using the countywide pool?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2012.49,2015.24,They were using the countywide pool as a reference--
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.24,2017.058,"But that's the case we're trying, right?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2025.795,2028.614,--The long term goal was 36.4 percent.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.614,2031.818,So it seems to me your response to Justice O'Connor is utterly irrelevant to this case.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2031.818,2033.951,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, because I--"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.951,2038.305,"Well, this is Mr. Johnson's case, I thought, and he's complaining about being denied a promotion."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2038.305,2039.022,"--He is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.222,2065.972,I don't understand.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2069.357,2070.639,"I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.994,2083.148,"When Mr. Johnson's case came up for promotion, was the agency applying a 30 percent goal or not?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2083.148,2084.016,Quota?
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.833,2088.284,Goal.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2088.284,2090.152,"Long term goal, yes."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.623,2144.204,"Well, Mr. Brooks, is it your position that the county as an employer can set an affirmative action plan goal that is geared to the number of women in the labor force in the county generally, as opposed to the number of qualified women in the available pool?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2144.204,2145.154,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.154,2151.392,That an affirmative action plan geared to the larger percentage is valid?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2151.392,2152.042,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.454,2175.175,Is that right?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2175.175,2176.075,Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.075,2194.403,"You mean it is statistically reasonable to expect as many women to be working on road crews and to believe that if there aren't that proportion there must be discrimination, as there are to think that there are women working in--"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2194.403,2198.54,I think that there would be an inference of discrimination drawn from that factor alone.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.54,2199.04,--What is that based on?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2202.909,2207.979,I think it is based on both human experience and governmental policy.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.979,2208.913,On human experience?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2208.913,2209.863,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.931,2212.415,In this country?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2212.415,2213.217,--Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.929,2276.873,"Without even considering at all whether you can bring forward any patently valid justification for the statistical discrepancy, for instance the relevant pool is not all women working in the county, but rather women working in this particular craft or this particular area?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2286.729,2289.847,I don't think I would say you can immediately begin to discriminate.
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.844,2322.902,"Well, he not only considered it; he did promote a less qualified woman over a better qualified man."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2322.902,2326.854,"Well, the district court did make that finding with respect to qualification."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.854,2331.841,"Well, that's the case we're... that's the case that's now here."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2331.841,2332.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.947,2348.719,"Well, could I ask you what you think that our cases last term held with respect to what circumstances justify giving relief to a non-victim?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2348.719,2369.264,"I think that your cases held that in the context of the problem that we have here is that where there is a firm basis upon which an employer can infer that its own practices may have been discriminatory, then the employer can voluntarily take affirmative action which is not victim-specific."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.697,2381.655,Do you think our cases said that the circumstances must evidence particularly egregious instances of discrimination?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2381.655,2385.19,I don't think the case law says it has to be particularly egregious.
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.164,2401.199,"But you wouldn't suggest that there was any evidence here of egregious discrimination, would you?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2401.199,2402.485,"There was no such finding, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.757,2415.959,"But the lady who, the woman who was promoted, was not a victim of discrimination?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2415.959,2419.161,"Well, the district court made one finding that's interesting."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.09,2445.894,"Of course, if that were the case none of you would really be here."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2445.894,2451.632,"--If the district judge had made the finding that she had in fact been discriminated against, yes, I think you're correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.632,2455.417,"Let me make sure I understand the sweep of your argument, Mr. Woodside."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2486.069,2487.555,I think that--
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.555,2497.177,"That that alone is enough to show, that statistical disparity is enough to justify an affirmative action plan, that is to say discrimination by the government on the basis of race?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2497.177,2504.065,"--If those differences that you describe are statistically significant, in other words if the difference between--"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.065,2504.85,Now you're hedging it.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2528.132,2535.119,--I think that raises the question as to whether or not the practices in the agency itself have been fair toward women.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.569,2537.738,"Well, now you sound like the other side."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2546.427,2556.783,"--I understood your earlier question to mean that any time there is a disparity between the work force and the labor market generally, would that constitute a prima facie case of discrimination?"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.484,2561.869,And justify immediate implementation of an affirmative action action plan?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2561.869,2570.292,"That's right, and it would be up to the Petitioner to prove that there is an alternative explanation for those statistical imbalances."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.292,2573.91,"Well, but they're trying to prove that here and you're saying it's irrelevant."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2573.91,2574.81,"No, they--"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.81,2581.58,You're saying that your client was authorized to institute the affirmative action plan because of the statistical imbalance.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2581.58,2591.788,"--But against the challenge, it would be up to the Petitioner to prove that it would be reasonable to have no women in the skilled craft category."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.521,2598.692,"No, not no women, just not necessarily to impose 30 percent women."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2602.061,2604.429,--The plan set a long term goal.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.696,2654.812,She didn't get it because she was better qualified.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2654.812,2659.1,"--She was certainly well qualified and, as the district court judge found--"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.1,2666.686,"What percentage did women then make up of the particular category of jobs, after her promotion?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2666.686,2668.555,--After her promotion?
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.244,2731.962,"Mr. Woodside, I'm puzzled when you say that this was not a case of an automatic preference for a woman."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2734.164,2735.6,"Oh, it's not the only reason, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.5,2739.385,"I mean it's the only reason he didn't get it, the other way around."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2739.385,2741.586,--That became the decisive factor.
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.537,2770.571,But that's not what happened.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2770.571,2775.808,"--Well, he did state that that became a factor in the decisionmaking process."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.808,2783.263,"Yes, but until she registered a complaint with the affirmative action section she was out, isn't that correct?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2783.263,2787.215,"Apparently she was out even before the second round of interviews, according to her testimony."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.798,2789.998,"Well, I don't know."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2793.785,2799.539,"Well, what I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that there is no automatic preference to be accorded women."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.239,2815.882,"Do you think it would be a violation of the statute if the county said, in departments where there are 238 men and you get a qualified woman that comes in, let's automatically give her some favored, better consideration than we would give a man?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2815.882,2818.234,"--On these facts, I do not think that would be a violation."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.45,2820.519,But you're just saying that's not this case?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2820.519,2824.404,"--That's correct, and I think this case is more subtle."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.744,2851.038,"Mr. Johnson, who had had his eye on this job for some time, apparently, and had taken a demotion and worked in a lower paying job for several years in order to obtain better qualification in order to get this promotion, he competed head to head with the woman who ultimately got the job."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2865.998,2868.433,"I think you could summarize it that way, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.408,2909.824,He had served in the job?
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2909.824,2910.608,Pardon?
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.608,2912.693,"He had served in the job previously, hadn't he?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2912.693,2914.478,Without competing with anyone else.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.478,2918.614,"That's right, serving above his grade, but on an acting basis."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2918.614,2921.716,"On an acting basis, without competing with anyone for that job."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.362,2953.103,"That sounds like you're saying that any time an employer wants to adopt a race conscious hiring or promotion policy, that should be permitted?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2953.103,2954.937,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.937,2956.822,"Well, he thinks it's fair; that's what you said."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2956.822,2957.339,No.
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.339,2959.924,He thinks it would be in his best interest; that's what you said.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2959.924,2978.218,"I think because of the statistics that were in this case and because of the evidence of practices that women had been excluded from training opportunities in the past, that the agency had refused to hire pregnant women and the like, given those facts, that it's permissible to engage in--"
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.218,2982.289,"Well, you're adding something in the balance besides a racial imbalance."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,2982.289,2991.062,"--Yes, but I believe those are the facts here, and I tried... I endeavored to answer your question if we were only dealing with racial... or sex imbalance."
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.895,3000.465,"My concern, Mr. Woodside, is not about preventing employers from doing what they think is best for the work force."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3012.94,3013.64,Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.64,3019.36,And one way to avoid being between the rock and the hard place is to put Mr. Johnson between you and the rock.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3047.446,3049.863,"Well, I think it was done for the good of the work force."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.809,3100.33,"Could I ask, did you say that some goals have been refined to say five or six percent?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3100.33,3100.847,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.847,3103.532,"In what, these skilled category jobs?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3103.532,3103.816,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.816,3126.213,"Well, suppose that prior to the adoption of your plan you had looked around and you had said, well, there's 30 percent of women in the work force in the county, but we only have six percent in these jobs."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3148.478,3152.263,"I understand, and that would be a harder, much closer case, Your Honor."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.959,3197.276,Let me just ask one more question.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3203.898,3204.615,Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.615,3206.031,He has no women in the work force at all.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3206.031,3206.684,Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.684,3208.434,He knows that no woman has ever applied.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3226.078,3240.404,"Well, it seems to me that in the question that you have asked, the absence of any women and the absence of women applicants may not answer the question whether or not there has been discrimination."
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.189,3251.129,"Well, my hypothesis is, whatever facts are relevant, he knows there just has never been any discrimination here, whatever the reasons might be."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3255.181,3260.651,"--Well, if it were shown that he knew there was absolutely no discrimination, that he the employer knew that--"
1986.85-1129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.651,3264.87,He did all the hiring himself and he knows he never had any applications.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3264.87,3266.222,--I don't think he could--
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.222,3272.708,"Well, even though that would make out a prima facie case of employment discrimination?"
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3272.708,3273.708,"--Well, that's the difficulty."
1986.85-1129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.831,3282.214,"Well, no."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3296.824,3303.228,--Then he's suggesting further that the explanation for that imbalance is no women have ever applied.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.43,3305.68,That's a defense to the prima facie case.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3305.68,3306.78,--Yes.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.78,3312.334,"He has a prima facie case, and I thought you had been saying that so long as there is a prima facie case he can institute an affirmative action plan."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3312.334,3314.051,"Yes, and I tried to--"
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.051,3316.237,So maybe you should have given a different answer to Justice Stevens.
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3316.237,3316.787,--I'm sorry.
1986.85-1129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.807,3325.759,"Me, too."
1986.85-1129,1,42229,steven_woodside,,3330.245,3332.997,--I have nothing further to add.
1986.85-1129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3333.563,3335.699,"Thank you, Mr. Woodside."
1986.85-1129,2,18444,constance_e_brooks,,3339.484,3341.936,I just have a few points to respond to.
1986.85-1129,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.18,3386.132,"Ms. Brooks, can you explain one thing to me?"
1986.85-1129,2,18444,constance_e_brooks,,3413.449,3427.023,"We don't agree that the employer would have been justified in preferring the woman, because if you look at the road dispatcher job you had 20 percent of the employees, 3 out of 18, were already women at the time."
1986.85-1129,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.096,3463.965,You don't believe there's a harmless error rule?
1986.85-1129,2,18444,constance_e_brooks,,3473.921,3478.308,"Not in this case, because there are other explanations for the statistical disparity."
1986.85-1129,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3563.727,3566.012,"Your time has expired, Ms. Brooks."
1986.85-1129,2,18444,constance_e_brooks,,3566.012,3566.429,--Thank you very much.
1986.85-1129,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3566.429,3567.929,The case is submitted.
