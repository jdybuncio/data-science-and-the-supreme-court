1984.84-76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Hunter against Underwood, et al.--"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,15.76,19.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-76,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,139.157,152.548,"Mr. Ward, do you know, does any other state than Alabama disinfranchise any category of non-felons?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,152.548,155.433,Presently?
1984.84-76,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,155.433,156.0,Yes.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,156.0,158.452,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1984.84-76,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.536,339.353,Mr. Ward--
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,339.353,340.472,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-76,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.472,346.708,--do you concede that the statute presently has a discriminatory effect?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,346.708,351.593,"No, ma'am."
1984.84-76,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,543.266,547.653,"--Mr. Ward, I suppose your opposition could make this same argument."
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,556.759,558.775,"Your Honor, they do not make it."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.605,633.24,"Before you get too deeply into your argument, what is a crime of moral turpitude?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,635.092,638.811,"In our state, Your Honor, you look at several places."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.452,685.254,--There is no one statutory frame of reference such as a list that is--
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,685.254,690.141,"No, sir, there is not, although there are cases which put out a list, but there is no list within the statute itself."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.141,696.045,--Nobody denies that this particular... that check offense was a moral turpitude crime?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,696.045,697.847,"No, sir, that is agreed upon by everyone."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.847,699.78,What about drunken driving just out of curiosity?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,699.78,700.198,"No, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.198,700.531,It is not?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,700.531,706.102,Would not nor can you lose your right to vote for drunken driving.
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.935,873.843,"Mr. Ward, doesn't that argument assume... this is sort of the same thought Justice Blackmun was asking you about... that there are other states which would pass a statute like this for a non-racial purpose and I don't know if there are any such states."
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,873.843,880.599,"Your Honor, I don't either but that is assuming that the state would not have that right."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.679,906.647,Do you think they could do it if they defined moral turpitude to include all traffic offenses?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,906.647,906.999,"No, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.766,908.366,Why not?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,914.42,916.105,"--Well, they are--"
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.105,917.555,A lot of people are killed on the highways.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,917.555,921.676,"--Well, perhaps if that specific finding was made."
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.911,1288.846,Why isn't it that you haven't mentioned the Fifteenth Amendment?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1288.846,1292.315,"Why, Your Honor?"
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1292.315,1293.083,Yes.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1293.083,1294.7,Well--
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1294.7,1296.619,It is alleged.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1297.469,1297.885,"--Yes, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.885,1299.469,It is in the case.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1302.204,1317.532,"Well, the argument, Your Honor, would be the same if now the effect of what is happening with Section 182 is on a basis other than race, is on a basis of any other bad attention."
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.567,1327.054,The Fifteenth Amendment says no discrimination of any kind by anybody.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1330.756,1333.125,"I believe it says based on race, does it not, Your Honor?"
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.125,1333.208,That is what I mean.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1333.208,1333.791,Okay.
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.125,1365.06,I haven't taken any position on that.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1370.381,1372.083,--Do I agree that the Fifteenth Amendment--
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1372.083,1372.849,Yes.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1372.849,1374.535,"--I didn't hear the last part of your question, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.535,1377.57,Do you agree that the Fifteenth Amendment controls this case?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1377.57,1378.737,"No, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.737,1380.689,"Well, why don't you argue it?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1380.689,1397.448,"Well, I argued it, I thought, in that the arguments I do make... that is if there is a permissible reason for what is happening now with the section that would pass constitutional muster under the Fourteenth or the Fifteenth."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.628,1440.16,May I ask you one other question about your approach... looking at just today's... what if the evidence showed for the first 30 years or whatever period it might be that the statute or the constitutional provision did abridge the right to vote on account of race and flatly violated the Fifteenth Amendment for the first 20 or 30 years of this effect.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1450.165,1456.153,"Your Honor, both the passage of time and changes in the Amendment itself."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.114,1484.804,Does your analysis in effect acknowledge that it was invalid for a short... during its original effective period or you say we just don't even have to consider that at all?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1484.804,1491.742,"Well, my analysis is I cannot get up here and say race did not play a part in it."
1984.84-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.742,1492.009,I understand that.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1521.595,1529.082,"I would still have to argue that, but I would have to say that again, because of the passage of time, that argument loses some of its strength."
1984.84-76,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.604,1538.688,"Mr. Ward, I did have one more question."
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1560.887,1563.422,"No, ma'am, it is not accurate for two reasons, Your Honor."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.371,1666.906,Could I ask you one other question.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1683.333,1694.056,"Well, sir, that was based on a finding which was challenged at trial."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.592,1700.377,"Well, what if I accept it though?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1700.377,1701.46,--Sir?
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.46,1706.198,What if that observation of the Court of Appeals is to be accepted?
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1706.198,1708.964,That--
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.964,1710.983,Yes.
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1723.841,1741.954,"--Well, if you accept that, if it still does have that effect, then I would suggest that there could be shown that there are reasons other than the selection of the crime that causes the effect."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.954,1742.987,"Well, that is a different argument."
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1758.631,1761.083,Purpose.
1984.84-76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.083,1773.473,"You said if North Dakota or Wyoming or some states who were not involved in those days passed this same statute now, you think it would be sustained."
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1773.473,1774.175,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.175,1784.048,"Well, you think Alabama may continue it if it has a discriminatory impact today?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1784.048,1807.414,"Your Honor, if it was passed again in the same manner, if this Court strikes it down and it is passed again in the same manner and it shows it still impacts against blacks, then proof would have to be adduced as to why and I think some things could be shown as to perhaps why."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.598,1815.15,"Well, should we judge the case on the basis that this observation of the Court of Appeals is correct?"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1818.454,1820.587,"--I don't believe it is, no, sir."
1984.84-76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.587,1822.006,"You don't believe it is, but--"
1984.84-76,0,33578,james_s_ward,,1822.006,1835.814,"If the state would have the right to disfranchise those who commit crimes involving moral turpitude and that is the reason why there is an impact, then, yes, you could."
1984.84-76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.749,1849.057,Mr. Still?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,1849.057,1852.592,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-76,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1941.7,1956.826,"Mr. Still, do you think that the state is forever bound by that original discriminatory purpose or can the passage of time and circumstances ultimately change that?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,1956.826,1958.092,--I believe they are bound.
1984.84-76,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1992.416,1999.419,"Well, in your view then is the felony disinfrancishement provision equally invalid?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,1999.419,2008.711,"That whole provision, Section 182, would probably have to be rewritten, but I think we would have to--"
1984.84-76,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.711,2009.644,Your answer is yes--
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2009.644,2010.394,--No.
1984.84-76,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.394,2011.477,--that it is also invalid?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2011.477,2025.237,"No, because the 1875 Constitution disfranchised the felons, so we would have to compare it against what they had before and go back to the provision that they had previously which would disfranchise felons only and not misdemeanors."
1984.84-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.237,2042.865,"Suppose, Mr. Still, that the 1901 attitudes were a continuation of the Jefferson point of view that only the property class should vote."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2045.817,2048.602,I believe that was Jefferson's view.
1984.84-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2072.984,2084.458,The provision with respect to whites in the 1901 Constitution would violate... Do you think it would violate the Fourteenth Amendment even if it didn't violate the Fifteenth?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2084.458,2091.696,Some of the provisions of the 1901 Constitution as applied to whites have been struck and as applied to all people.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2118.179,2128.221,"Mr. Still, what worries me is suppose the legislature of Alabama tomorrow adopts this same law."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2128.221,2135.641,"Well, first of all, I do not believe that the legislature of Alabama would adopt this law."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2140.112,2142.545,Would you mind assuming that hypothetical.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2142.545,2143.064,All right.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.967,2150.867,That is what worries me in this case.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2150.867,2169.245,"--Well, the Plaintiffs would still have to show in that kind of situation that the... whether or not the provision had been adopted for a racially discriminatory purpose and then also they would still be allowed to show whether or not it had a racially discriminatory effect."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.245,2170.928,I said enact.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2170.928,2176.999,"Well, my answer would be same whether they enact it for the first time or they re-enact it."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.999,2182.053,You would say that tomorrow Alabama would do it on racial grounds?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2182.053,2185.255,I am saying the Plantiffs would have to prove that.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.255,2185.488,I am talking about tomorrow.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2185.488,2188.04,I am saying the Plantiffs would have to prove that.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.707,2197.313,What evidence do you have to Alabama doing it today?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2197.313,2201.265,I am not suggesting that Alabama would adopt this provision today.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.303,2216.457,"All I asked is if Alabama does it tomorrow it still will be unconstitutional, is that your answer?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2216.457,2219.742,"No, sir, no Your Honor."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.13,2256.182,So it would be valid?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2256.182,2258.034,"--No, this--"
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2258.034,2261.402,"If it was adopted tomorrow, it would be... You said they couldn't show it was invalid."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2261.402,2261.786,"--No, sir."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.786,2263.086,"So, wouldn't that be--"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2263.086,2265.354,"Your Honor, I have not said that they could not show it was invalid."
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2269.842,2272.208,"--Well, they can't prove it is invalid or can they?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2272.208,2277.178,--I believe they can prove that it is invalid because of its present continuing effect.
1984.84-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.005,2327.511,"Mr. Still, just how much evidence do you think a Plaintiff has to have to make the sort of showing that the Court of Appeals found you have made here?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2344.473,2358.665,I think in any type of test that you apply that this situation in Alabama is going to be held to be discriminatory because the racial--
1984.84-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.665,2361.517,I think that is probably true but that wasn't the question I asked you.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2361.517,2365.235,"--Well, I do not know how much is necessary."
1984.84-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.465,2393.052,"But, you wouldn't offer any more general test than just whatever the test is of this passage which is certainly a permissible point of view."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2393.052,2394.321,I would suggest that.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.464,2464.316,Still I say that there is nothing wrong with the ordinance in Yick Wo.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2464.316,2465.667,--Well--
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2465.667,2471.571,Yick Wo said it was enforced with a discriminatory purpose.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2471.571,2472.954,--It was--
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2472.954,2476.523,"And it didn't knock the statute out, it knocked its enforcement out."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2476.523,2476.975,--That is right.
1984.84-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.879,2483.246,Right.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2483.246,2487.748,"And, Gomillion is another example of a pretty transparent law."
1984.84-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2510.78,2519.318,"I know, but can you be sure without the sort of evidence of actual discriminatory intent that you adduce on the part of the sponsor that it is necessarily a pretext?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2536.68,2554.225,"If you had that kind of evidence in this case, that would be a contraindication to the evidence that we have, but as one of the expert witnesses said, while the evidence may be circumstantial it all points in the same direction and that is the kind of situation we have here."
1984.84-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.745,2694.815,May I ask one other question about the moral turpitude and the particular offense here which I guess was passing a worthless check.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2699.684,2725.918,"If you overdraw your bank account, if you have a non-sufficient funds check and the merchant sends you the check or sends you a certified letter that says I have got your check for $25, come in here within ten days and clear this up, and you don't respond to the letter, that is considered to be prima facie evidence that you intended to defraud the person, that you intended to give him a worthless check."
1984.84-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.669,2754.954,--Is it the opinion of the Attorney General?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2757.14,2763.226,I believe there is an opinion of the Alabama Supreme Court in this particular case.
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.503,2865.944,"I take it the import of your argument, present argument is that without any consideration of race this statute is invalid."
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2865.944,2867.844,--Yes.
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.979,2874.8,Because it picks and chooses among almost identical kind.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2874.8,2881.454,That is correct and that particular argument that we made has not yet been ruled upon by the Court of Appeals.
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.656,2885.722,Are you relying upon it here?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2885.722,2893.428,I rely upon it to the extent that I believe that it may assist the Court in making--
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.428,2894.362,As another ground for affirmance?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,2894.362,2895.796,"--Yes, as another ground for affirmance."
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.662,3028.198,Was it credible?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3028.198,3030.35,Pardon?
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.35,3033.435,Did they say not legally valid?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3033.435,3035.12,I believe they--
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.12,3038.506,On the grounds of discrimination on the equal protection--
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3038.506,3054.266,"--They rejected it as being an insufficient grounds because they said... You say you want to disfranchise people who have been convicted of violating your laws, but you leave out a lot of serious offenses and reach down and get people--"
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.266,3057.201,--So they just said their explanation was not credible?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3057.201,3059.085,--They said the explanation was not credible.
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.858,3154.797,"What was the effect of the Court of Appeals' judgment, that this particular provision is just invalid on its face?"
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3154.797,3158.666,They declared it to be invalid as applied to misdemeanors.
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.666,3161.185,Both blacks and whites?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3161.185,3162.735,"Yes, as to both blacks and whites."
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.735,3164.486,Why do the whites get the benefit of it?
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3164.486,3166.271,"Well, because the provision is--"
1984.84-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.271,3172.658,You say what you are relying on is that the purpose of it was to discriminate against blacks.
1984.84-76,1,46126,wilson_edward_still_jr,,3172.658,3188.852,--In all other cases that I know of where a court has invalidated a law on the basis that it was infected with a racially discriminatory purpose and it also had some effect on whites as well as on blacks.
1984.84-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3212.083,3214.419,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Ward?"
1984.84-76,2,33578,james_s_ward,,3216.937,3229.262,"Justice Stevens, I have the citation to that case if you would like it, sir, to the state decision that defines this offense as one involving moral turpitude."
1984.84-76,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.262,3229.595,Yes.
1984.84-76,2,33578,james_s_ward,,3229.595,3230.562,"If you would like it, I have it."
1984.84-76,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.201,3241.403,Thank you.
1984.84-76,2,33578,james_s_ward,,3241.403,3241.853,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.205,3247.988,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
