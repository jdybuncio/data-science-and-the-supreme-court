1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.004,The case is submitted.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,68.208,73.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.382,144.081,And whose date of birth was that?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,144.081,147.355,"No one that we know of, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,206.784,209.244,Did (Inaudible) save him?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,209.244,209.881,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,376.517,386.669,"And with this duplicate driver's license, at what stage did that get into the hands of the person to whom it was not lawfully issued?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,386.669,389.484,This was earlier in 1972.
1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,396.748,400.194,Well then and by what?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,405.622,413.929,Mr. McCollan said in the trial that he didn't know how his older brother came by the information.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.699,451.329,"Another point, was he fingerprinted?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,451.329,452.083,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,453.004,455.97,Did they agree with the other thing?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,455.97,461.359,"No, sir, Your Honor, and this is the point that it's being raised by respondents in this case."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.306,539.862,"But if they sent that to Dallas, that's all that have been avoided."
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,539.862,541.792,This is the assumption that it's made.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.183,571.478,Assuming the police officer sent fingerprints over the wire?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,573.139,574.561,I assume that is Your Honor.
1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.495,591.616,"Well, does this particular sheriff's office have the facilities for transmitting fingerprints by mail?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,591.616,597.099,"Well, by mail I don't know if they do any telegraphic method."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.432,611.026,This particular place had the fingerprints of both of them?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,611.026,615.323,"The place where he was ultimately held and released, yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.323,618.282,And couldn't they have get into the officers when they went to Dallas?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,618.282,619.903,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,619.903,621.796,There were none to stop them from doing that one?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,621.796,625.991,"No, sir and we're not -- we're certainly not contending there was."
1978.78-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.189,949.178,"When you talk about respondeat superior, Mr. SoRelle, aren't you ordinarily talking about the liability of the supervisor for the negligence of his employees and here as I understand it the deputies were simply carrying out the instructions of the sheriff, that wouldn't be respondeat superior to say that the sheriff is liable if he directs one of his deputies to go and arrest somebody, would it?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,949.178,950.006,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1016.78,1019.39,That's the point I'm worrying about.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1028.869,1029.256,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.967,1097.034,"Suppose -- I think it's your position here is though that even no matter how negligent the sheriff might have been and then you say he wasn't negligent at all, no matter how negligent he might've been 1983 just doesn't reach that kind of conduct."
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1097.034,1099.853,"Well, not any level of negligence."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.663,1102.969,"Well, it may not, not this maybe, but --"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1102.969,1106.027,We are talking here about simple negligence because there was --
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.027,1114.064,"Well, suppose there was a failure to exercise a reasonable care here to ascertain whether they have the right man."
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1114.064,1114.221,Yes sir.
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.986,1148.019,"Well, a known duty is the -- the duty not to hold somebody without probable cause to believe he has committed a crime?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1148.019,1148.398,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.13,1155.508,And would you say you should take reasonable care and to validate that duty?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1155.508,1155.867,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.973,1171.108,"Well, suppose there wasn't those reasonable steps taken in this case?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1171.108,1174.836,"Well, there is no evidence concerning the reasonableness of the steps taken."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.836,1182.047,"Don't say, just suppose there weren't -- I suppose that was conceded but there were not reasonable steps taken to identify the person."
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1182.047,1185.319,And if there was known duty to take the steps then I think we may have that --
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.319,1191.392,"Well, I don't know and that's part of the question but you know you're not supposed to arrest the wrong man."
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1191.392,1192.624,Certainly.
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.624,1199.691,"And so, suppose there's an unreasonable -- there is a failure to take reasonable steps to identify the person you're arresting?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1204.074,1204.696,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.696,1207.127,Would you think that when 1983 would reach it or not?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1207.127,1208.86,I think this start is getting closer.
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1243.952,1244.785,"Mr. SoRelle, can I --"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1244.785,1245.43,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1245.43,1247.464,-- test what you're saying for minute?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1271.048,1271.366,"Yes, --"
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1271.366,1274.729,-- we'll have to find out whether it's negligence or deliberate indifference or what?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1274.729,1287.358,"Well, I believe that we first look to the statute in 1983 to determine since that statute under which we were recovering to try to determine whether this requires intentional conduct."
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1287.358,1290.078,"Well, but is there anything in 1983 on this subject at all?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1294.513,1299.941,It says that one who subjects or causes one to be subjected.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1364.293,1380.211,"Isn't true that the “Sheriff's Office” was the cause of this man being arrested, the cause of him being transported back to Potter and it cause from being held until the sheriff appear in the middle?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1380.211,1381.691,"Well, --"
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1381.691,1383.62,The “Sheriff's Office”.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1383.62,1385.901,"No, the sheriff's office -- the sheriff had nothing to do with issuing the warrant."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.901,1388.203,I said the “Sheriff's Office”.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1388.203,1388.544,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1396.664,1399.019,"Well, who told to Dallas to hold him?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1399.019,1402.271,"Well, they -- when a warrant is issued apparently they -- this is communicated."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.271,1405.657,"Well, who told to Dallas to hold him?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1405.657,1406.052,"Well, --"
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.052,1408.035,"Well, next, who went to get it?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1408.035,1409.315,Potter County Sheriff's Office went to get it.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.315,1409.909,Alright.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1409.909,1413.637,And certainly unquestionably they intentionally confined him.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1413.637,1414.343,Right.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1414.343,1419.179,But they did not intentionally confine him without a warrant or without process in any fashion.
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1419.179,1423.777,But they are the ones that did deny him his right to freedom.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1423.777,1431.414,"If you have a right to freedom, that's unfettered without any ability to rely upon process."
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1448.096,1451.872,"That was on January 2nd, he got back to Potter County on December 30th?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1451.872,1453.434,December 30th in the evening and --
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1453.434,1458.276,And then didn't he then protest that he was the wrong man and didn't they then have fingerprints available right there?
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1458.276,1462.765,"Yes, sir, and they did not -- the officers that were there did not compare it."
1978.78-752,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1465.446,1469.296,And at that point it was under the jurisdiction the Sheriff's Office at least.
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1469.296,1472.046,"It was in the Sheriff's Office unquestionably, yes, sir."
1978.78-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.046,1481.106,"In Texas, is it true as in most place I've observed that public offices aren't really beehives of activity over New Year's weekend?"
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1481.106,1506.808,"Yes, sir and unfortunately this was the case in this office at that time and it is certainly that should not necessarily be a reason but the evidence indicated that the normal of the people weren't there and it takes certain people to compare fingerprints and photographs and there were -- the Sheriff was not notified of the man's contentions and because immediately upon being so notified, they didn't act to release him."
1978.78-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.808,1509.094,(Inaudible)
1978.78-752,0,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,1509.094,1516.997,"Your Honor, if I might I would reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
1978.78-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.997,1519.812,Mr. Larson.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1519.812,1522.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1522.506,1537.59,"I'm not clear on the facts here yet either from the reading of the appendix and records or the argument, how did this unauthorized license get in the hands of driver's license get in the hands of unauthorized person?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1537.59,1542.158,"Your Honor, I don't know and I don't believe my client knows."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1624.927,1627.286,Is his name Linnie?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1627.286,1628.447,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1628.447,1629.72,And his brother's name was Leonard?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1629.72,1633.756,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1633.756,1636.663,And how was Linnie misspelled as Leonard or what?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1636.663,1643.487,"Well, he says that his birth certificate has L-I-N-N-E-Y on it not L-I-N-N-I-E."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1643.487,1644.477,I see.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1644.477,1650.678,That's what his contention is.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.927,1667.803,"That's long time ago, isn't it?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1667.803,1668.536,"Yes, it was."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.536,1671.195,I think they have this kind of suit in mind at the time?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1671.195,1679.682,"Well, I believe that there were some questions before Congress whether or not Negroes were being properly treated by the law enforcement."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.682,1683.663,"Well, wouldn't you be here whether or not your client was a Negro?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1683.663,1686.625,Yes.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.228,1699.219,Do you have a cause of action in the state courts of Texas?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1699.219,1699.492,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.425,1701.719,Why didn't you go there?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1701.719,1707.209,"Well, because I don't like to try this kind of case is in the state courts of Texas, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.832,1727.249,This (Inaudible) of Potter County?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1727.249,1732.956,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.526,1781.953,Are you talking about an ordinary tort law?
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.953,1783.218,You're talking about tort law?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1783.218,1784.152,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.152,1785.03,Aren't you?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1785.03,1785.887,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1785.887,1790.835,I thought your theory was that this man had been deprived of his liberty without due process of law in violation of Fourteenth Amendment?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1790.835,1804.807,"That's correct and I also believe that the Constitution requires that the sheriff in this case arrest only the persons that are actually warranted pursuant to the warrant just because he has a warrant it says, “Arrest Linnie McCollan.”"
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1814.611,1819.177,But those -- that material didn't do him any good when he sent his deputy over to Dallas to pick the man up.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1819.177,1820.223,That's right.
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.477,1838.34,"Mr. Larson, are you saying that every case of false imprisonment or false arrest a common law tort is necessarily a constitutional violation?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1838.34,1839.977,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.977,1842.606,"Well, what's the line?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1842.606,1848.318,"Well, there's a lot of false arrest case that occurred between private parties and --"
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.318,1854.742,"Well, supposing a false arrest or false imprisonment by a state or a person acting under Colorado state law."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1854.742,1861.85,"Well, if there's a -- there's an underlying constitutional requirement to effectuate liberty, yes."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.85,1863.39,But that's what I'm trying to ask you.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1874.574,1879.77,Yes.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.952,1976.007,"Well, don't you have to have in the record?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1985.151,1986.571,"Yes, but he did have it yes sir."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.571,1987.456,Is that in the record?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1987.456,1989.939,Yes but he had the fingerprints.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.939,1990.793,That's in the record?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1990.793,1991.332,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.812,1993.528,In the record?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1993.528,1994.747,"That's right, it's in the record."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.86,1996.178,And of brother Leonard?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,1996.178,1997.479,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2010.777,2017.924,"In fact, may be so in fact but you have difficult time persuading me that that's true on the basis of this appendix."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2017.924,2019.555,"Well, I understand that but --"
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.555,2024.26,But that it's clearly different that these two are so clearly different.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2030.274,2038.654,"Well, the Fifth Circuit concluded in its opinion that there were no -- that they weren't alike, that you could easily tell it."
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.818,2059.649,"Now, you've described this in your brief and I'm still not clear on the relevance of it but you described it as a forged fictitious driver's license since you've gone to that trouble to describe it that way."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2062.489,2071.232,"Well, the Sheriff Baker's predecessor in office took the driver's license away from Leonard when he arrested."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.652,2100.398,"But that wasn't Sheriff Baker, it was his predecessor?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2100.398,2102.116,"Yes, sir but I'm not --"
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.116,2105.649,"And Sheriff Baker did not respond before his predecessor did, is it?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2105.649,2109.17,"No, and I'm not and I haven't maintained that in the trial of this case, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.969,2156.534,Do you really think that's where the burden is?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2156.534,2156.806,Yes.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2156.806,2162.035,In every time a person is in a jail or prison?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2162.035,2170.34,"If the person who is imprisoning, the plaintiff has the fingerprints and the mug shots, he has an obligation to check."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2170.34,2171.247,"(Voice Overlap) -- well, I misunderstood you."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2180.433,2180.924,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2184.388,2187.075,I think this is true of every warden in a penitentiary.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2187.075,2189.163,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.163,2192.253,That the presumptions against the custody of the people in this charge?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2192.253,2196.441,The presumption is on him because the Constitution said he can't deprive somebody without --
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.441,2214.281,"Well, let's assume that most people in the prisons of our country are there because of not everybody is there because they've been convicted in criminal courts on criminal charges and sentence to prison and yet you say the presumption is against the validity of their imprisonment?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2214.281,2221.525,"No, sir, I'm not saying the presumption is against the validity of their imprisonment but I'm saying that the duty is upon the jailer --"
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.525,2223.174,To justify the imprisonment always?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2224.335,2229.274,That's right because the person incarcerated doesn't have anyway to get access to the records.
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.041,2249.541,"Well, what if the warden about prison having 5,000 inmates takes a stroll through the athletic field and a prisoner yells at me, I'm wrongfully confined, I don't belong here."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2259.773,2266.494,Not immediately because he has the leisure by which he can go back and check on a daily basis.
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.74,2272.29,But the same day he would have to check?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2272.29,2276.438,"Well, quite frankly, on our suspect that almost everybody in jails thinks they ought not to be there."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.438,2277.702,I think so too.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2277.702,2292.009,"But yes, I think the Constitution requires a jailer to know the authority for a -- whom we hopes and to be constantly checking and verifying it so that he can determine when his person is suppose to be released."
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2302.316,2302.609,Alright.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2312.527,2313.006,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.006,2316.897,"Well, I thought the applicant of the plaintiff had the burden of proof?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2316.897,2318.496,"Yes, he does but all he has to show is --"
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.496,2320.813,Because you he doesn't you say.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2320.813,2321.586,Yes.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2332.973,2335.895,"Mr. Larson, he doesn't even have the burden to show he was unjust."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2342.049,2353.01,"No, the client in this case established that it wasn't justified to hold him because the sheriff failed in his duty to determine they only have the right people."
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2353.01,2362.417,"I understand but the word, I mean the sheriff who have meant his burden initially by saying, well I arrest him pursuant to a warrant but that's all and then the burden shifted back to you and say, well, yes but you got the wrong man."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2362.417,2362.628,Right.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.708,2379.132,"Well, I don't --"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2379.132,2379.147,-- and --
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.147,2382.266,--arrest my Chief Judge.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2382.266,2383.055,"No, offense intended."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.055,2389.409,(Voice Overlap) the losing argue.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2389.409,2391.693,"Alright, I will change example to John Smith."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2446.084,2461.963,"What I don't understand is that you filed habeas corpus and you say, I am not the right man and warden files a capias and said, well, here is the instructions I got to put this man in jail."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2466.767,2467.493,Yes but the claim is --
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.493,2469.215,"So, there is some burden on you?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2469.215,2470.223,That's right the plaintiff did in this case.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.223,2472.824,That's all because the particular time to say (Voice Overlap).
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2472.824,2476.305,"I understand, but plaintiff did in this case."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.933,2484.587,(Voice Overlap) would he show that.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2486.902,2487.351,That's right.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.351,2490.017,"Well, he didn't show that while he was being held, did he?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2490.017,2492.329,"No, he couldn't -- he didn't have access to the records."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.329,2493.806,What did he say?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2493.806,2496.844,"He says, I'm not the one, there's a mistake."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.844,2498.215,And that's all he says?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2498.215,2502.085,"Well, it's inadmissible because of the -- because the --"
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2502.085,2504.427,He doesn't admit it?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2511.5,2518.61,I would suspect that's true but that doesn't relieve a person who places him in jail the burden of determining that he has the right person.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2518.61,2527.749,"Well, Mr. Larson, is it now your claim or was it in your complaint that this arrest was not made on probable cause?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2527.749,2529.278,I'm not complaining about the arrest.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2530.339,2537.511,"Well, the arrest was what led to the custody and it was the arrest made on probable cause or not in your submission?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2537.511,2540.283,The arrest was made pursuant to a warrant.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.728,2554.08,"No, I think my answer -- my question could be answered yes or no and then so what you wish but I -- is it part of your case that the arrest was not made on probable cause?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2554.08,2556.077,No.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.077,2557.72,Do you concede that it was --
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2557.72,2558.046,Yes.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.046,2560.456,-- made on probable cause?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2560.456,2579.124,"If the Court would look at the record, you would say that when I asked the jury when I submitted my interest to the jury my question for the jury was, did the sheriff make a reasonable ask, did he reasonably make a determination as to whether or not he had a lawful authority to hold the plaintiff?"
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2600.225,2616.462,"All we know in this talk is there being two people, both named Linnie McCollan one guilty of an offense and the other not all that talk is really -- there's nothing to do with probable cause, does it?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2616.462,2618.969,No.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.561,2624.523,You're not saying this was an invalid arrest?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2624.523,2625.216,No.
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2625.216,2630.829,Nor that the -- therefore that the ensuing custody at least for a short time was not valid?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2630.829,2632.043,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.043,2636.654,At what point after the arrest to this become unlawful?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2636.654,2640.881,"Well, the sheriff testified that the standard is --"
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.881,2642.489,Never mind what the sheriff said.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2658.025,2661.56,"Well, that was a jury question and we never got in answered, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2694.627,2696.989,"Mr. Larson, is there also the third alternative?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2705.601,2705.748,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2705.748,2706.826,-- to compare.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2710.215,2713.174,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.174,2719.805,But you're saying at least you're saying at some point in time after repeated the assertions that on -- that you got the wrong man.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2723.824,2731.594,"Well, I think the fact that the plaintiff makes an assertion that he want anyone's help but I don't think that's determinable of the case."
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.945,2740.658,And at some point he determined that he did not have the right?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2740.658,2750.272,"That's right, it's probably because a (Inaudible) the plaintiff in jail and said that's not the man and went down told the sheriff, however the records are not clear on that."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.272,2755.459,Does the record show exactly what was said by respondent when he arrived at the jail?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2755.459,2756.016,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.016,2756.76,What did he say?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2756.76,2758.674,"He said, I'm not the one, there's a mistake."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.217,2761.963,Did he offer any explanation?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2761.963,2764.823,"He didn't have any, he didn't know."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.823,2768.459,At that stage he didn't know it was his brother that they want?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2768.459,2770.254,He didn't know whether it was his brother or not.
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2826.034,2827.885,Is that an issue here Mr. Larson?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2837.016,2837.969,That's true.
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2837.969,2841.623,"Well, then why sexy, is it maybe is it here?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2841.623,2850.481,"Well, I think the issues that this petitioner find here covered that issue."
1978.78-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.481,2853.711,"Well, you're not obliged to follow if he's in error?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2853.711,2856.282,I agree.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2887.045,2894.676,"Mr. Larson, would it be correct if the issue really is whether the constitutional violation deprivation of liberty without due process of law."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2910.033,2910.886,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2910.886,2919.627,So it simply it proceed the constitutional violation was the failure to accord due process which means a failure to check this man's identity when it was appropriate to do so.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2919.627,2920.212,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2920.212,2923.428,"So, if you don't look at negligence or good faith or any of the stuff, do we?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2923.428,2924.749,That's my position.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.749,2935.214,And what do you do with the bench warrant that's authorized either pick up John C. Doe immediately?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2937.719,2939.804,All warrant's command I believe that's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2939.804,2944.324,"Well, what discretion did the sheriff have then?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2944.324,2949.674,"Well, I trust that he would do something to try to narrow down which John Doe --"
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.674,2957.734,"John Doe who lives at 2268 Appleway Drive, Amarillo, Texas."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2957.734,2960.079,"Well, --"
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2960.079,2963.188,Zip code 17822.
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2963.188,2969.675,I would assume then that the sheriff is under the duty to arrest the John Doe that they find in that address.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.675,2972.976,"Well, could he get the same trouble he has here?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2972.976,2973.972,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2973.972,2974.737,Why not?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2974.737,2976.514,Unless there were some other information --
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.514,2980.912,"Well, I mean couldn't they issue bench warrant in this case and then jump in?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2985.145,2985.835,"Yes, sir but --"
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.835,2987.215,In most states?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,2987.215,2989.988,"I'm not complaining about the arrest, Justice Marshall."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.159,3005.771,"And all the man says, I'm not the man then he has to go to work."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3005.771,3008.487,"I don't think you even matters whether or not he says, I'm not the man or not."
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.774,3011.979,To make sure that he is --
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3011.979,3013.375,To make sure he is the right one.
1978.78-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.375,3014.271,That's your position?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3014.271,3015.472,"That's my position, yes, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3015.472,3019.488,Even if he had -- he signs a statement admitting that he is the man described on the warrant?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3019.488,3036.99,"Well, the common law saw that problem because that's one of the exceptions to the rule that if the person who's about to be arrested says that well, then he has a -- then the person who effectuates the false imprisonment is let off the hook."
1978.78-752,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.99,3038.926,"Well, because that way he's made sure he's the man."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3038.926,3044.083,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.083,3052.459,Do you think sheriff had a qualified privilege under the facts of circumstances of this case?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3052.459,3053.492,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.492,3054.584,Not at all?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3054.584,3055.655,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.655,3057.627,Why?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3057.627,3069.036,Because the duty is on him to verify that he has the right person and he didn't do that duty nor did he issue any regulations in his department.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.935,3085.379,"Not with the Governor of the state had any privilege if he acted as you suggest by doing nothing, fail to act?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3088.082,3089.575,"Well, that's a different case."
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.575,3091.249,"Governor different from a sheriff, is he?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3091.249,3091.97,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.208,3098.933,Do sheriffs have a qualified privilege?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3098.933,3102.378,A jailer or a sheriff has a certain duty.
1978.78-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.378,3102.839,My question was that --
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3102.839,3106.985,"It involves knowing -- it involves no discretion, the duty is clear."
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.742,3138.68,"Well, the sheriff could arrest the wrong man on a warrant and where there's probable cause like you say there is here."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3145.784,3146.845,"No, sir."
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.189,3162.074,"Well, then his duty isn't to have only the right man, is it not?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3162.074,3163.65,It's after a reasonable time it is.
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.65,3169.672,"Well, alright, I'll say set off to pick fingerprints and the answer came back yes, this is the right man."
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3171.975,3173.203,"Well, --"
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.203,3174.37,Then what about the sheriff?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3174.37,3176.527,Well that would be on his rim or responsibility (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.527,3182.536,"Well, alright, but he still got the wrong man so his duty isn't just to have the wrong man, is it or to have the right man?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3182.536,3185.551,The duty is to use as much information he has at hand.
1978.78-752,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.551,3186.082,That's different.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3186.082,3193.02,"Isn't even that, is it Mr. Larson, his duty to follow a procedure which will reasonably identify the man as being the right man, isn't it?"
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3193.02,3193.766,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3193.766,3195.483,And you say didn't follow the right procedure?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3197.807,3200.367,That's correct.
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.367,3209.947,At any time did he indicate that there might be some problem about his brother having created this identification problem?
1978.78-752,1,21132,douglas_r_larson,,3209.947,3213.978,"There's nothing in the record to indicate that, Your Honor."
1978.78-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3217.448,3223.76,Mr. SoRelle.
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3223.76,3225.961,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-752,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3249.747,3251.93,I didn't understand that Mr. Larson to be saying that.
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3253.997,3268.349,(Voice Overlap) but he suggest that as a matter of due process that reasonableness of identity must include using fingerprints and photographs under these circumstances.
1978.78-752,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3268.349,3270.459,Not for the original arrest as I understood Mr. Larson.
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3270.459,3300.02,"Well, Your Honor may I submit that due process then should not require that at any stage in this proceedings during this period of time simply because if plaintiff respondent in this case is going to demonstrate a -- an unreasonable method of identification then he should've approach it by showing that the method used was unreasonable."
1978.78-752,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3306.418,3314.459,"Mr. SoRelle, isn't one of the complaints that the sheriff have been out celebrating New Year's Eve, he may have been turn loose right away?"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3314.459,3315.593,"No sir, I don't think that was suggested --"
1978.78-752,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3315.593,3322.139,"Well, and the record show that as soon as the sheriff was made aware of the facts he turned the man loose."
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3322.139,3332.097,"Absolutely, and it is our position that this is one of the reasons why the sheriff in this case should not have been held liable under state --"
1978.78-752,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3332.097,3335.989,He could've come in during the holiday and take a look at his job.
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3335.989,3341.106,"Yes sir, and he did -- he had telephone contact one of his deputies obviously failed to --"
1978.78-752,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3341.106,3341.919,"Well, I would say to you --"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3341.919,3342.826,-- advise him.
1978.78-752,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3342.826,3346.481,-- the more contact you get in with the jail the more trouble you get in.
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3346.481,3358.182,Certainly but he had no notice that this man was arrested and we're talking here of according to respondent about an intentional tort that he intended to arrest to this man and --
1978.78-752,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3358.182,3378.907,"Your brother Mr. Larson, we're not really talking about the arrest anymore and it seems to me that the complaint is rather the procedure is eradicate and you change the procedure but if your man is set up being over the weekend had been in Mexico for two weeks presumably the man would stay in jail for two weeks until the sheriff get back and you made precisely the same argument as long as he found out he let him out."
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3378.907,3379.812,No sir.
1978.78-752,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3381.107,3383.487,What's the difference between three days and 13 days?
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3383.487,3389.519,"Well, the point is that some place in here, this is a personal action against Sheriff Baker."
1978.78-752,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3392.835,3396.071,"Well, he didn't make adequate procedures for identifying people who have been arrested."
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3396.071,3397.861,"Acted erroneously yes, sir."
1978.78-752,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3407.159,3414.593,"Well, that's right and those procedures if the sheriff had been gone for three weeks under those procedures, this man ought to stay in jail for three weeks."
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3414.593,3415.355,I don't believe so.
1978.78-752,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3424.662,3428.595,"Well, if you say this why didn't they do as soon as they picked him up and brought to move to --"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3428.595,3434.464,"Well, I think the only testimony was that the ID man was not on duty during that period himself."
1978.78-752,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3451.634,3456.491,"The Court of Appeals simply said the case have to go back for a jury verdict, didn't it?"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3456.491,3468.226,"The Court of Appeals, yes sir, they finally determined that it should go back to determine whether the sheriff was unreasonable in failing to have previously instituted this policy."
1978.78-752,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.226,3472.891,"So, and that was to be determined by the jury or judge as my question of fact?"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3472.891,3487.084,That would be a question fact and it was our position of course that this is a pure negligence issue and that if this Court affirms that holding that it would be extending 1983 to Simple Negligence Act.
1978.78-752,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3487.084,3497.734,"So, under the Court of Appeals' holding the procedures used by the sheriff would be a question of facts for the jury in every case as to whether they confer to the Constitution?"
1978.78-752,2,17072,a_w_sorelle_iii,,3497.734,3498.324,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-752,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3579.551,3580.78,Thank you gentlemen.
