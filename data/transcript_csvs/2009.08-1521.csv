2009.08-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.59,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1521, McDonald v. The City of Chicago."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,7.432,26.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although Chicago's ordinances cannot survive the faithful application of due process doctrines, there is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing the lower court's judgment."
2009.08-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,72.078,76.828,"Of course, this argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which have been the law for 140 years."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,83.699,91.288,"--Your Honor, the Slaughter-House Cases should not have any stare decisis effect before the Court."
2009.08-1521,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.364,108.173,What injustice has -- has been caused by it that we have to remedy?
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,131.149,132.553,State--
2009.08-1521,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.553,136.928,What -- in which ways has ordered liberty been badly affected?
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,136.928,147.939,"--Justice Sotomayor, States may have grown accustomed to violating the rights of American citizens, but that does not bootstrap those violations into something that is constitutional."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.939,156.655,Are you saying that the rights -- if you could clarify your conception of privileges and immunities.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,167.679,170.819,"Justice Ginsburg, that is correct."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.476,179.128,But -- just tell us the dimensions of what it is.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,201.947,218.128,"--Although it's impossible to give a full list of all the unenumerated rights that might be protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, just as it's impossible to do so under the Due Process Clause, at least with respect to the Privileges and Immunities Clause we have wonderful historical guideposts."
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.565,233.545,"Mr. Gura, do you think it's at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it under our established law of substantive due process?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,233.545,235.651,--It's--
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.651,240.931,Is it easier to do it under privileges and immunities than it is under substantive due process?
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,240.931,247.194,"--It's easier in terms, perhaps, of -- of the text and history, the original public understanding of--"
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.194,247.662,"No, no."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,263.061,266.217,"--Justice Scalia, I suppose the answer to that would be no, because--"
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.217,285.534,"And if the answer is no, why are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of prior law, when -- when you can reach your result under substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you're bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty--"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,286.099,286.614,--No.
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.172,303.137,"Well, I mean, what you argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure, but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,313.29,323.114,"Justice Scalia, we would be extremely happy if the Court reverses the lower court based on the substantive due process theory that we argued in the Seventh Circuit."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,333.483,344.964,"But that -- that court does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,365.739,368.563,"Of the unenumerated rights, Justice Ginsburg?"
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.563,368.941,Yes.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,368.941,376.873,"Well, the framers clearly used language that to them meant rights beyond those guaranteed in the first eight amendments."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.009,427.508,Even though -- even though a large portion of the population at that time didn't have those rights?
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,427.508,437.287,"--The large -- the population at the time that did not have those rights needed their protection, primarily in the South, which is why the Civil Rights Act--"
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.287,439.989,"No, throughout -- throughout the nation at the time."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,439.989,442.376,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.376,452.702,"Did married women at that time across the nation have the right to contract, to hold property, to sue and be sued?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,452.702,461.62,"Married women were considered citizens of the United States, just like children were considered citizens."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.937,485.251,Does it work just one way?
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,500.23,516.252,"--As we mentioned -- as we mentioned in our brief, this Court in Benton v. Maryland decided that henceforth American history and tradition are important to consider what rights are protected in this country."
2009.08-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.498,546.255,"But this -- then it's not one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights, or the rights that any free society -- basic to a free society."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,551.691,556.55,As understood by the people who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.198,578.071,"Well, what about rights rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,580.415,583.694,--Yes.
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.694,586.848,That happens to be the test we have used under substantive due process.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,586.848,589.348,"That's correct and, as Judge O'Scannlain--"
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.348,589.754,Yes.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,589.754,599.109,"--in the Ninth Circuit observed in the Nordyke decision, the Slaughter-House dissenters seemed to arrive at the same point, perhaps, that this Court did in the Glucksberg case."
2009.08-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.109,605.964,"Mr. Gura, can I ask you the same question Justice Ginsburg asked about: What if there were no Second Amendment?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,616.493,618.197,"It would be, Your Honor."
2009.08-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.726,637.905,"Because of the -- the importance of the right to protection -- and would that apply to the entire scope of the Second Amendment or just the right to keep the gun, a homeowner's right to keep a gun for self-protection against intruders into the home, under the -- without the Second Amendment, just the Liberty Clause?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,637.905,645.591,"--The Second Amendment is not so limited and neither is the right to arms, even outside the Second--"
2009.08-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.591,650.041,I'm assuming we don't have a Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due process analysis.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,663.053,676.389,"--An unenumerated right to arms in the absence of the Second Amendment would be, perhaps -- probably identical to that secured by the Second Amendment, because the Second Amendment codified the understanding of that right that people have historically had in the country."
2009.08-1521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,681.326,682.169,"Well, I thought your--"
2009.08-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,682.169,693.883,"In -- in that context, is your position that the rights that are incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,704.252,708.046,--With respect to the substantive due process argument that we're making?
2009.08-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,708.046,708.249,Yes.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,708.249,717.842,We are not challenging -- we are not the party that's before the Court that is challenging anything that has gone on before in terms of substantive due process.
2009.08-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,725.055,745.438,"No, I understood the Chief Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my understanding of the question as important is this: Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and sophistication with which we interpret them for the Federal Government."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,764.869,766.897,"--Yes, Your Honor, because--"
2009.08-1521,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.897,767.225,Okay.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,775.847,777.005,--Well--
2009.08-1521,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.005,777.956,There are two ways.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,852.811,860.263,--Federal judges should carry this out in the same way that was announced in this Court's decision in Heller.
2009.08-1521,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.934,864.682,"Heller, I didn't think, explained that with great -- I was dissenting, though."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,868.76,884.315,"--Heller stood for the proposition that some activities are within the core boundaries of a right, and so long as people wish to do something that is literally understood to be a part of the boundaries of the right, it is to be protected, and--"
2009.08-1521,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.315,897.714,"Let me be specific, suppose Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human lives every year."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,905.275,915.426,"--We decide that by looking, not to which side has the better statistics, but rather to what the framers said in the Constitution, because that policy choice was made for us in the Constitution."
2009.08-1521,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.147,922.987,"You're saying they can have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have guns even if they're saving hundreds of lives -- they can't ban them."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,922.987,927.764,--The City cannot ban guns that are within the common use as protected by the right to arms.
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.764,946.431,"There's a lot of statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but the confession can't be used."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,951.929,953.879,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and as your opinion--"
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.879,957.315,"Well, why would this one be resolved on the basis of statistics?"
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,965.668,966.42,--That--
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.42,973.073,"If they want to have, you know -- I think we mentioned in Heller concealed carry laws."
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,986.003,992.297,"--Well, Your Honor, we do agree that statistics are not important to determine whether or not a right--"
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.297,994.059,For the judges.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,994.059,995.062,--That's right.
2009.08-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.062,996.95,But they would be for the legislatures.
2009.08-1521,0,16041,alan_gura,,996.95,1012.88,"A legislature should respect the fact that there is a constitutional right at issue, and this Court in footnote 27 in Heller explained that under the Carolene Products paradigm, footnote 4, rights enumerated in the Constitution are entitled to a greater measure of respect."
2009.08-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1016.034,1016.752,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1025.514,1036.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this court's existing jurisprudence, the case for incorporating the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.305,1057.659,"Mr. Clement, would you comment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that necessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the Federal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that with regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there's a difference."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1065.843,1069.449,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think in that respect the Sixth Amendment is a bit of an outlier."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.008,1084.225,"Well, what is the last case in which we incorporated a substantive provision?"
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1084.225,1088.725,"Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp, is one way of thinking about it."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.084,1090.503,Mapp was a procedural case.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1090.503,1090.784,--I could quibble about that--
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.784,1092.519,Mapp was a Fourth Amendment case.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1097.675,1098.174,--Well--
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.174,1106.795,"The procedural cases come in under the due process language, but the substantive cases comes under the word ""liberty"", and ""liberty"" picks up the First Amendment and so forth."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1115.276,1115.9,"--Well, sure."
2009.08-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.027,1164.535,I guess we -- I guess we have applied substantive due process with regard to the necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on demand.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1173.298,1191.259,"--That's also right, Your Honor, though I guess I would stress that I think that, whatever the debate's about substantive due process when it comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of this Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual provisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored position with respect to incorporation."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.205,1212.625,"They stand in a favored position, but we've never said had to be literally all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1212.625,1223.776,"--Again, though, it's interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where the Court has not effectively translated all the case law is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment criminal jury right."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.29,1381.147,"That's true of the criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things?"
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1398.499,1409.464,"Well -- and, again, Justice Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text of the Due Process Clause--"
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1409.464,1413.571,Incorporation jurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case for 30 years or more.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1413.571,1415.228,--That's right.
2009.08-1521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1434.109,1442.7,"That still allows scope, once you determine that the right is incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't have."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1450.744,1456.992,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be said for any other one of the other incorporated amendments."
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.537,1501.786,You're -- you're dead right--
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1501.786,1502.769,--let's bring the jurisprudence with--
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.769,1513.747,"--about the majority of the Court, but it's interesting that during this whole period, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on whether it should be just the substance of the right or the -- every detail."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1521.339,1522.493,--Well--
2009.08-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.493,1527.46,"He is very much against you, and he's a very important member of our -- of our history."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1527.46,1530.21,--Justice Harlan was a terrific justice.
2009.08-1521,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1532.538,1533.084,Maybe we should go back--
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1533.084,1534.316,--in his total incorporation--
2009.08-1521,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1534.316,1541.191,"--Well, Mr. Clement, why shouldn't we go back completely to Justice Harlan's view about the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the States?"
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1541.191,1549.278,"--Well, I think if we are going to go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice Harlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think, that would be much more similar to the approach--"
2009.08-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.278,1550.172,But there is a difference.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1550.172,1551.903,--that we take in this case and that Mr. Gura takes in this case.
2009.08-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1551.903,1553.076,There is a difference here with the other amendments.
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1595.339,1610.536,"Well, I mean, I guess what I -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that this Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to basically apply the operative clause in light of the prefatory clause, why one would want to come to a different conclusion--"
2009.08-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1610.536,1611.815,Because the -- one of the reasons--
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1611.815,1612.646,--with respect to the States.
2009.08-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.646,1631.168,"--at least, is that -- you've read, I'm sure, that all the law professors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament to -- well, I can't go on here."
2009.08-1521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.902,1638.336,"You can respond if you want, briefly."
2009.08-1521,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1638.336,1639.759,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1666.794,1668.077,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1673.073,1683.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Amendment should not be incorporated and applied to the States because the right it protects is not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.278,1712.119,"When is the last time an opinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1717.477,1719.789,"--I don't believe it was, Your Honor."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.101,1723.397,Has it been the basis of our decision in any case since Palko?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1723.397,1726.707,--I think the -- the Court has -- the Court has used the term in a number of cases.
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.748,1740.34,"And it was also the Harlan view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case and in Poe v. Ullman."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1746.384,1747.745,"--Yes, I do."
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1747.745,1752.585,I was going to ask Mr. Clement what test he thought the Court used.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1756.052,1757.865,"Yes, I do, and here's the reason why."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.348,1806.924,Is the right to trial by jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1806.924,1807.704,--I--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.704,1808.125,My goodness--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1808.125,1809.298,--I think that it--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.298,1814.937,"--there are a lot of countries that don't give the right to trial by jury, even England does not give it in all criminal cases."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1814.937,1827.01,"--I think it is in the following sense: When you're talking about a procedural right that's embedded in a particular procedural system, you have to look at how that system operates and how the -- the right works within that particular system."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.01,1830.43,"Well, I think that's exactly -- that's exactly right."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1854.701,1857.481,I -- I agree -- I -- I think that's right.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.729,1868.633,"Well, if you think that's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the reasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right is essential to our system, whatever it may be with respect to France or England or anywhere else?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1868.633,1884.564,"--The question that the Court was addressing in Heller was not -- again, was not how important the Second Amendment right was, or how implicit it is in our system; it was what did it say and what did the -- what restrictions did the framers of the Second Amendment impose on the Federal Government."
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1884.564,1900.633,"But I thought its rationale was that because of its fundamental character, the right to bear arms must be understood as separate from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all people, most people in the United States."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1912.301,1913.568,"No, I -- I -- I don't think that that's right."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.469,1928.436,I don't see how you can read--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1928.436,1928.577,--under the Seventh Amendment.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.577,1938.244,"--I don't see how you can read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the Second Amendment, whether you'd want to label it fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers in their view of what liberty meant."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1938.244,1950.066,"I -- it was important, but actually what Heller says is this: The Second Amendment preexisted the -- its inclusion -- or the right that's in the Second Amendment preexisted its inclusion in the Bill of Rights."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.292,1972.119,That may be--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1972.119,1973.102,--with its inclusion in the Constitution.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.102,1974.712,--That may be the reason it was put there.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1976.397,1977.352,That's--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.352,1979.302,And that's the crucial fact.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1992.47,1995.453,--That -- I agree as far as the Federal Government goes.
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.162,2023.207,"So do we read the -- the clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we're supposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2025.391,2025.516,Yes.
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.516,2026.031,--the answer to that's yes.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.252,2026.58,Yes.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2026.58,2026.861,Yes.
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.861,2027.532,Thank you.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2035.234,2036.357,"Well, that -- that--"
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.357,2038.763,--And does that not give us a clue as to what they thought that--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2038.763,2039.34,--That's what--
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.34,2040.541,--the ordered liberty was?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2041.809,2043.556,--That's what -- and that's what Heller said.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.484,2070.672,"Well, sure, and it's still going to be subject to the political process if the Court determines that it's incorporated in the Due Process Clause."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2083.853,2085.163,--That's -- that's--
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.163,2090.972,"And so the argument you make is, well, given this context, you should not be able to have concealed carry."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2098.612,2100.191,"--No, I don't think so."
2009.08-1521,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2135.723,2142.454,And your position is that a -- a State or local government could completely ban all firearms?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2142.454,2147.983,"If the State and local government did that, I think would it raise two questions."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.331,2171.084,I -- I don't understand.
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2171.084,2172.769,What is the due process liberty--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.769,2174.176,What basis would there be to -- to deny that?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2174.176,2175.315,"--Well, there's always--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.315,2179.094,"Firearms kill people is what the States say, and -- and we ban it."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2179.094,2180.19,"--Right, and that has--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.19,2181.079,Other countries have done that.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2181.079,2185.029,--It has not led to States doing it in -- in this country.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.046,2188.718,"But if they did do it, I think you'd have to say it's perfectly okay."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2188.718,2191.011,"--No, the second -- there would be two questions actually."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.73,2195.979,Yes.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2196.822,2210.614,"The second argument would be, the Court at that point, if in the very unlikely event a that a State or local government tried to do that, then the Court might have to wrestle at that point with the question of the relationship between self-defense and the right to keep and bear arms."
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2212.77,2216.61,--But would self-defense be part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of the Due Process Clause?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2216.61,2227.03,"--I mean, if by that is, do you have a substantive right to self-defense, the Court actually has never answered that question, but I'm willing to accept that there is such a right for--"
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2227.03,2228.933,And you've given -- you said there were two reasons.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2231.511,2249.128,"--Yes, and -- and what I'd say about the right to self-defense is, if -- if the challenge -- if a State or local government banned all firearms it might raise the question of, given that there -- if there is a constitutional right to self-defense, has the State prohibited you from reasonable means of exercising that right?"
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.362,2262.372,"Without repeating that and just so I understand your position, how could some member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was correct?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2262.372,2277.432,"--I -- the Court would just say that what Heller held was if you look at the meanings that the words in the Second Amendment had, the common meaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion -- the common meanings that the word had in 1791, it imposed limitation on the state."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2290.144,2294.847,That sounds an awful lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the losing side.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2294.847,2297.249,"Well, it's actually what the Court said in its opinion."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.182,2315.76,They said that is the reason it was codified.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2326.816,2328.754,And that -- that--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.754,2334.186,And to say that that wasn't the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about what it consists of.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2334.186,2348.306,"--That -- that's correct, and I'm not arguing today about what it consists of, but the point being that this was a right that had been -- that the framers as far as we know would have been satisfied to leave to the political process if it was just a question of the feature of it."
2009.08-1521,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2348.914,2349.885,Let me see if I understand your argument.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2368.626,2369.204,--That's correct.
2009.08-1521,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2369.204,2375.231,And -- but I thought you began by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2375.231,2380.309,The right to keep and bear arms that was recognized -- I don't think actually the right to keep and bear arms itself is.
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.363,2403.878,But--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.878,2407.204,"Mr. Feldman, let me take your argument at -- at its face value."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2426.978,2428.257,"Yes, but I -- that--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.257,2428.694,Then so--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2428.694,2430.523,--But that--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.523,2439.956,"--even if you assume that the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to the State's depriving the people of arms."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2439.956,2449.907,"--Yes, but I don't think the argument -- the primary argument that's being made today, that this is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or sufficiently fundamental or whichever other formulas--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.907,2450.719,You're switching horses now.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2450.719,2451.436,"--No, I'm not."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.686,2456.575,Let's just focus on your argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2467.744,2482.332,--I -- I think that few people today would say -- and in fact few people in 1868 would say that the concern to protect the State militias is something that's so fundamental or essential to a concept of ordered liberty or central to our system that it has to be--
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.332,2482.988,"--Well, suppose it is."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2482.988,2483.128,--protected--
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2483.128,2483.939,--Suppose it is.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2544.412,2558.969,"--It -- that would be -- that would be possible, but another -- another way to look at it is that the question that the Court had -- the Court has never answered the question, is this implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or should this be incorporated under any other test?"
2009.08-1521,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2558.969,2560.205,But if we took the approach that--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2560.205,2560.564,By just--
2009.08-1521,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2560.564,2575.324,"--If we took the approach that Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do the same thing with respect to all the applications of all of the amendments that up to this point have been regarded as being completely incorporated, along with all of our decisions?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2586.866,2589.533,--I -- I don't think -- I don't think the Court would.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2606.169,2614.666,"Well, to get back to Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered, is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of is it in or is it out?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2617.197,2618.445,"--No, I -- actually my -- excuse me."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.971,2626.05,"So you think it's in or out, right?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2626.05,2630.627,"--I think that -- I think the best argument is that it's out, for this reason: When the framers--"
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2630.627,2631.735,"No, I -- I know your reasons."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2631.735,2632.016,--Okay.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.016,2648.588,"I'm trying to get you to take a position on whether or not you want us to not only pick and choose among which amendments are part of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you want us also to take amendments that might be in and refine them and shave them off a little bit and say, well, this part of the amendment is in, and this part isn't."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2648.588,2650.226,"No, that's not the argument that we're making."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.226,2650.725,Okay.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2652.351,2654.414,The argument that we're making -- yes.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.414,2654.882,Okay.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2654.882,2655.552,The argument that we're--
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2655.552,2657.07,Step one -- step one is make my chart.

2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2671.046,2672.528,That's how you think Madison went about his job?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2672.653,2673.277,--No.
2009.08-1521,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.607,2675.262,"He did, actually."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.479,2677.324,I'm asking counsel.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2679.383,2683.728,--I think the framers had reasons to put everything in the Constitution that they put in it.
2009.08-1521,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2707.371,2722.213,"Mr. Feldman, our selective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process Clause does suggest that there are some rights that were fundamental enough to be incorporated and some that are fundamental, but not fundamental enough to be incorporated."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2736.079,2744.763,"I think that's the underlying standard, but the Court has certainly looked at our history and our traditions in answering this question, and I think they are relevant in this area, as they were--"
2009.08-1521,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2744.763,2755.12,"The Chief says: Yes, if we look at it, we have to look at it in the context of our history, our structure."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2759.336,2759.82,--I would say that--
2009.08-1521,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2759.82,2764.491,"--in our structure or our history, it's not fundamental enough--"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2764.491,2765.177,--Yes.
2009.08-1521,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2765.177,2766.456,--to incorporate.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2766.456,2768.581,"Yes, and I think it's -- I think it's not."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.999,2793.337,"Eleven of the colonies had a guarantee at the time the Constitution was adopted, and I believe something like 44 States currently have in their constitutions protection of the right to bear arms."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2793.337,2794.167,--I -- I--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.167,2799.27,Does that suggest anything about -- about how fundamental it is generally?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2799.27,2808.926,"--I -- what the Court actually said in Heller was that there were two States at the time, in 1791, that had a firearms right, and with -- there were possibly two more where the evidence was a little bit more ambiguous."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.512,2868.854,"""Subject to such regulation"" certainly excludes banning them entirely, which is what you assert can be done."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2868.854,2870.933,"--No, I think that--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.933,2874.414,What's the purpose of a State constitutional guarantee which has at the end of it
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2882.034,2882.206,--With that--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.206,2884.877,--would make a nullity of the constitutional requirement.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2884.877,2902.538,"--The overwhelming consensus among the State courts in interpreting the wide variety of different types of provisions that they have is that it imposes a reasonable regulation standard that is not violated by banning a particular weapon or a particular class of weapons, as long as you are allowing some kind of firearm, and that is not the right that this Court--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.538,2903.399,And is that what you're asserting here--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2903.399,2904.054,--recognized in Heller.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.054,2906.148,--that the States have to allow firearms?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2906.148,2907.989,No.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.989,2908.394,Is that--
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2908.394,2910.583,I -- I didn't think I was.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.583,2911.787,"--I didn't think so, either, so--"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2911.787,2912.645,No.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.191,2914.833,--why does your last argument make any sense?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2914.833,2915.925,"--No, what I'm saying -- I'm sorry."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.124,2932.857,That's fine.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2932.857,2936.246,And that is -- and the kinds of firearms that have traditionally been banned--
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.246,2936.885,We said as much in Heller.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2936.885,2937.743,--Right.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.687,2965.671,"Well, all those may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court incorporates the Second Amendment."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2976.321,2981.804,I think the Court in Heller did hold that a ban on -- a ban on handguns is invalid.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.098,2994.909,Handguns in the home?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2994.909,2995.814,--They--

2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2998.766,3003.984,"--They banned -- I -- well, not -- I can't say that they banned handguns in the home per--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.984,3005.622,"No, you can't, because they didn't."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3005.622,3022.538,"--But if you look at the decision -- no, if you look at -- actually, if you look at the decisions, some of them banned the sale; they banned carrying them anywhere in the jurisdiction, and in such a way that -- and some of the judicial decisions even say: This was intended to eliminate these weapons from our jurisdiction."
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3105.02,3124.014,"But there -- but there are provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, that have been incorporated against the States, where the States have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting -- rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3130.199,3133.931,"--Well, it's just that the end -- I have really two points I'd like to make about that."
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3190.017,3204.153,Do you think there is existing authority with reference to other provisions of the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate just the core of Heller with respect to the States?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3210.665,3211.882,"Well, I think that there would be--"
2009.08-1521,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3211.882,3216.102,"And if so, what's -- what case do we look to for that proposition?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3216.102,3222.629,--I think really this -- I cannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to that -- would lead to that.
2009.08-1521,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.629,3242.746,"If you look to Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of Rights, and there's no reason in the world why this Court could not adopt the same position here and say: Insofar it's incorporated, it applies only within the home."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3246.369,3260.833,"And actually the other point I make is if you approach it from the other point of view, the case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been brought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people the -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the right to have any kind of reasonable means of self-defense."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3260.833,3261.067,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3265.345,3266.316,No.
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3266.316,3270.873,"Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens is no, you're not going to follow that approach, right?"
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3270.873,3289.712,"No, what I would say is that -- what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was saying is that if the Court approaches it from the standpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court chooses in an appropriate case to recognize a fundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise those kinds of questions."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.707,3307.237,"See, the right to keep and bear arms is right there."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3311.748,3312.559,"--Well, I--"
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.559,3319.185,You -- you want us to impose that one on the States but not -- not the explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3320.183,3323.088,"--No, actually I -- I don't want to impose that on the States."
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.484,3347.048,The District of Columbia did.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3349.328,3355.294,"Well, the District of Columbia in any event is controlled by Second Amendment as it -- as it's written."
2009.08-1521,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3356.994,3365.413,Would you be happy if we incorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part of the incorporation?
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3366.727,3370.085,"Well, there is the reasonable regulation standard."
2009.08-1521,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3384.658,3387.875,I thought that Heller -- Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3387.875,3389.185,--Excuse me.
2009.08-1521,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3389.185,3398.165,"I thought that the Heller decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned."
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3398.165,3398.649,Right.
2009.08-1521,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.324,3439.009,What you're urging is really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates.
2009.08-1521,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3481.4,3494.066,"--I -- I think that, if I may -- that the restriction that the Second Amendment imposes on the Federal Government should be and is controlled by what the meaning of that Second Amendment was in 1791."
2009.08-1521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.375,3500.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3502.139,3502.563,Sure.
2009.08-1521,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3502.563,3524.099,"Counsel, at the -- at the very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the question which, as I understood it, essentially said what are examples of privileges and immunities that are being denied by the States that -- which denial would be remedied by following your proposal to overrule the Slaughter-House case?"
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3546.215,3563.265,"Well, apart from the Second Amendment right, which is being denied to people in the United States by Chicago at least, there are other rights -- other rights enumerated in the first eight amendments that were thought to be the personal guarantees as well as certain unenumerated rights which were understood to be part of--"
2009.08-1521,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3563.265,3564.903,What are examples of those?
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3566.213,3567.668,--The jury trial--
2009.08-1521,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3567.668,3569.01,And grand jury.
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3569.747,3571.338,"--There's not much left, Your Honor."
2009.08-1521,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3585.815,3594.718,"So you are saying that under -- under your view, every State would have to use a grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information."
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3607.732,3612.15,"--Yes -- well, it's not just what we're saying; it's what the framers of the Constitution said."
2009.08-1521,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3618.677,3621.38,--That's a criminal case; that's quite different.
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3621.38,3621.645,That's right.
2009.08-1521,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3633.203,3634.185,"Well, I'm -- we're using up your time."
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3634.423,3634.922,Sure.
2009.08-1521,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3634.922,3639.762,--do you want me to leave the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial and jury case -- that's it.

2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3656.756,3659.006,--The right to contract--
2009.08-1521,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3659.006,3660.504,Isn't that an unenumerated right?
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3660.504,3665.361,--That is literally understood by the framers to be an unenumerated right under the privileged immunities.
2009.08-1521,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.655,3688.697,Your approach -- your original approach would give judges a lot more power and flexibility in determining what rights they think are a good idea than they have now with the constraints of the Due Process Clause.
2009.08-1521,3,16041,alan_gura,,3688.697,3697.771,"No, Your Honor; our approach might actually provide judges with perhaps no more than what they have now, perhaps even less, because our approach is rooted in text and history."
