1982.81-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.277,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 81-1304, on the consolidated case, National Association of Greeting Card Publishers against the United States Postal Service."
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,16.01,49.216,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the rate-making provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, which eliminated the Post Office Department and transferred its functions to the United States Postal Service."
1982.81-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,306.19,310.094,"What would be an example, Mr. Segal, of one in that category?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,310.094,321.964,"Well, for example, they have a contingency grant, one which provides for contingencies that might arise in the coming year."
1982.81-1304,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.351,344.629,"Mr. Segal, are there other causal costs that don't vary either directly or indirectly with the amount or weight or volume of the mail?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,344.629,359.858,"Yes, there are, and in our judgment, for example, they will amount to about $6 billion, or 25 percent of all costs which will be apportionable to the other eight factors in 3622."
1982.81-1304,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.858,364.903,"Well, generally speaking, what do those consist of, the causal costs that don't vary?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,364.903,366.495,The causal costs that don't--
1982.81-1304,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.495,372.149,With the volume or weight or number of pieces.
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,372.149,376.804,"--Well, you might have a building which is up for 30 years without change, is a good example."
1982.81-1304,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.96,382.787,"How about transportation costs, in your view?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,382.787,396.875,"--Well, the transportation cost is really an abomination as it is presently being... if it is hired, if they hire the equipment, then they attribute."
1982.81-1304,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.175,431.611,Does United Parcel Service run its business quite differently than that?
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,431.611,436.75,United Parcel Service does run its business quite differently.
1982.81-1304,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.276,565.884,"Well, you don't really care about what happens to first class mail, do you?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,569.024,574.772,"We are worried that the more they are subsidized, Justice Rehnquist, the less they will ask for money for Parcel Post."
1982.81-1304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.506,809.238,"--Mr. Segal, may I ask you just one question?"
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,809.238,809.895,--Yes.
1982.81-1304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.895,820.704,Do you have... Can you give me an idea of what your view of the percentage of total costs that should be allocated under a proper reading of the statute?
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,820.704,821.735,That should be allocated?
1982.81-1304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.735,826.904,"In other words, if you just take short-run variable costs, you allocate maybe 50 percent of that total cost."
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,826.904,827.217,That's right.
1982.81-1304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.217,828.451,What is your view of the--
1982.81-1304,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,828.451,840.633,"We would believe 75 percent, and that 25 percent ought to be for the other eight factors distributed at the discretion of the agency."
1982.81-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.986,872.62,Mr. Perlman.
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,872.62,883.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. Segal has spoken to you from the point of view of the Postal Service's competitors."
1982.81-1304,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.5,904.155,"What do you mean by unilaterally increasing, Mr. Perlman?"
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,904.155,914.479,"--Well, in the Rate Commission decision, the Rate Commission established a rate of 18 cents, and other rates for other classes."
1982.81-1304,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.268,941.752,"You mean unilaterally, then, the board of governors acting without consent or approval of the Rate Commission?"
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,941.752,942.375,"That is correct, sir."
1982.81-1304,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.718,1030.653,"Well, are you suggesting that there is only one way to handle these nine factors?"
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1037.993,1043.226,"Well, I believe that there is a great deal of discretion on how the other factors are applied."
1982.81-1304,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.192,1050.426,I see.
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1050.426,1065.591,"But we are just reporting it as a fact, but the result is that you have a very, very high percentage of costs far out of proportion to weight, volume, or number of pieces that is placed on first class mail."
1982.81-1304,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1065.591,1079.415,"Mr. Perlman, there is... at least I understand there is a widespread and long-standing popular belief that junk mail has been carried on the shoulders of all the other mail, if you know what I mean by the junk mail."
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1095.222,1097.439,"Your Honor, that is why we are here in this court."
1982.81-1304,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.937,1106.747,"Well, your attack seemed to be, or your point seemed to be focused more on first class."
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1106.747,1118.993,"--Well, we believe, as Mr. Segal stated, that second, third, and fourth class mail are undercharged, and that the difference is made up from first class."
1982.81-1304,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.693,1135.614,Does your client for first class mail have a first class mail rate.
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1135.614,1136.535,That is correct.
1982.81-1304,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.392,1145.594,"Mister Segan's are competitors with second third and fourth class, i take it."
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1145.594,1147.514,"Well, they're competitors with fourth class."
1982.81-1304,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.514,1149.717,They want high parcel post rates.
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1149.717,1150.546,That's correct.
1982.81-1304,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1150.546,1174.161,"Mister Perlman, I was a little confused as to whether you were concerned with the degree of proof required presently by the commission or with the underlying concepts employed."
1982.81-1304,1,36492,matthew_s_perlman,,1194.199,1197.072,"Justice O Connor, the two really merge."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,1712.894,1722.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by allaying Justice White's concern about the government's concession in this case."
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.27,1830.035,Is your position in your brief here perfectly consistent with what the Second Circuit held?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,1830.035,1831.253,I believe it is.
1982.81-1304,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.312,1895.649,"What do you have to say, Mr. Garvey, about that general proposition, whether myth or reality, that upper class mails have been carrying the junk mail to people's doors at the expense of the upper class mails?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,1895.649,1909.94,"The Postal Reorganization Act was designed to eliminate or to preclude in the future if it had not happened in the past that sort of discrimination against not only third... not only first class mail, but other classes of mail as well."
1982.81-1304,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.264,2121.917,"Mr. Garvey, I think you said the statute says that the Commission shall make the rates fair and equitable."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2127.602,2128.133,--Yes.
1982.81-1304,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.133,2131.336,Do you think that refers to schedule of rates?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2131.336,2132.617,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.502,2153.014,"Mr. Garvey, do you disagree with what I thought both courts accepted as a premise, that the cost factor, whatever it may be, has to be given priority?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2153.014,2154.232,"No, we do not."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.232,2155.545,You don't disagree with that?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2155.545,2156.216,"No, we do not."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.542,2161.105,Of requirement.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2161.105,2162.167,--that it is a requirement that--
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.167,2168.618,Does that then... does that not necessarily mean that we must know the scope of (b)(3) before we reach the other factors?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2168.618,2169.351,"--Yes, it does."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.258,2174.646,And what is your view... let me just get it... as to what is the scope?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2180.674,2194.216,"--Well, no, what I said was that in this general rate proceeding before the Postal Rate Commission of the costs which were attributed in the Postal Service's proposal, 13 percent were what are called long-run variable costs."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.852,2210.912,What is the total... What is the percentage of total costs that short-run variable costs reflect?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2214.615,2227.109,--What the Postal Service... the amount of attribution that the Postal Service proposed before the Commission in this proceeding was 59.3 percent of the total costs of the Postal Service.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.109,2228.749,Which included the 13 percent long-run.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2228.749,2230.124,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.124,2233.279,"So you subtract 13 from 59, and you get the... answered my question."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2233.84,2237.589,"I suspect, although I am always nervous about doing subtraction with those rates."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.652,2250.617,What else is there in the variable cost factor that you think is correctly there other than the 46 percent and the 13 percent that should properly be there?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2250.617,2251.539,I'm sorry.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.695,2255.381,"What do you think the term ""costs"" includes?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2258.848,2279.589,"I think it is perfectly clear from the report of the Kaple Commission, from the House conferees' statement, and from the indications in the Senate report that what Congress had in mind attributing by way of costs were, first of all, those costs that are specific to a particular class of mail."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.708,2300.754,Then that is an example of something that is neither a short-run nor a long-run variable cost.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2301.299,2306.858,"Strictly speaking, I think it would be a variable cost over the long run."
1982.81-1304,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2334.224,2339.159,Is that kind of equipment within your definition of volume variable cost?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2339.159,2353.059,"No, that sort of equipment, again, it depends on the length of the time period that you are going to look at in defining variations, but that sort of--"
1982.81-1304,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2353.059,2366.35,"Well, I thought your brief took the position that the subsection we are talking about only required as a rate floor the volume variable costs attributable to a class."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2366.35,2381.359,"--I hope not, because we also believe, as the Kaple Commission stated and as the House conferees' report said, that the kinds of costs which the Postal Service is required to attribute are costs which... let me quote to you from the House conferees' report."
1982.81-1304,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2416.722,2419.47,You think they were wrong in saying short-term.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2420.736,2423.874,I'm not sure that it's fair to say that they were wrong in speaking of short-term.
1982.81-1304,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.798,2504.419,"Mr. Garvey, you have answered several questions about short-term costs and volume-variable costs."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2522.272,2549.01,"The question in this case is really how far the Postal Service and the Commission are required to go in discovering what kinds of costs are caused by particular classes of mail, and the Postal Service does not take the position that it has to be proven by empirical studies to vary with volume to a specific percentage."
1982.81-1304,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.394,2655.391,"Well, what if in the example you just gave of the postman going around the letter route and the Post Office saying it shouldn't be attributed--"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2655.391,2655.905,--Yes.
1982.81-1304,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.905,2667.697,"--because it is a fixed cost, as you call it, supposing there was... someone else comes in and says, well, under my theory of accounting, that is not a fixed cost, and the court were to conclude, well, you could go either way on this thing."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2677.787,2678.568,Absolutely.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.882,2717.147,"Mr. Garvey, unfortunately, we tend to jump around a little bit in an argument like this."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2737.717,2747.477,"I think it is difficult to... I can give you examples, and I can give you the general definition of what they treat as properly attributable."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.477,2753.131,"I would like examples, if you could, because it seems to me that the Commission does have a duty to obey the statute."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2753.131,2753.756,Yes.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.74,2761.16,"And so, of course, we have to know what the statute means and know what components the Commission thinks belong in the various categories."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2761.16,2780.948,"What the Postal Service contends are the costs that are attributable under the first part of Subsection (b)(3), as I mentioned before, are the costs that vary with the volume, number of pieces, weight, cubic dimensions of the mail, or costs that are specific to a particular class of mail, like the parcel sorter in the example that I gave."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.803,2832.926,But am I correct that the cost of using their own vehicles is not attributed?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2832.926,2843.923,"--That's correct, although it's misleading to suppose that the sort of use of the Postal Service's own vehicles is the same as the use of vehicles for purchased transportation."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.486,2881.314,"Let me just interrupt you, if I may, on the vehicle cost again."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2890.967,2901.352,--It is the Postal Service's position that the phrase 3622(b)(3) does not mean what Petitioner UPS contends.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.352,2902.181,"Well, what does it mean?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2902.181,2908.178,That is a reference to the remainder of the provisions in 3622(b).
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.983,2933.667,"By reasonably assignable, you mean with respect to all other costs other than direct and indirect."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2936.901,2937.244,--That's right.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.819,2958.469,"Well, you would agree, I assume, that there are cost accountants who could assign vehicle costs and also route time costs other than on a strictly volume basis."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2958.469,2959.36,--Yes.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.794,2967.794,It may even be good accounting practice.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2967.794,2971.997,What I do... It is not the consistent practice of all accountants.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.715,2974.964,"No, but it may be good accounting practice for many accountants."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2974.964,2982.414,"--I am not even sure that it is good accounting practice, because it tells you very little about what you want to know for purposes of ratemaking."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.267,3052.854,"Just to clarify, your view is that reasonably assignable means reasonably assignable in accordance with factors 4 through 9 of the statute?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3052.854,3056.368,"Factors 1, 2, and 4 through 9."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.368,3056.821,Right.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3056.821,3057.54,That's correct.
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.54,3066.239,At least you say that it is not unreasonable in assigning those costs to refer to those particular factors.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3066.239,3073.08,"I believe it would not be, and I don't understand the Second Circuit's opinion to forbid that sort of technique in future rate proceedings."
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.08,3086.215,"It may be that there is another way of assigning costs, but it is not unreasonable within the meaning of the statute to use these other factors to assign."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3086.215,3089.917,The factors for which Petitioners are plumping in this case?
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.917,3095.915,"Well, no, the factors which you say the Postal Service uses in assigning costs."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3095.915,3099.429,Absolutely not.
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.784,3111.83,You don't even need to win on that.
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3127.605,3129.447,"Absolutely, although--"
1982.81-1304,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.447,3134.086,"And... At least that is a fallback position, isn't it?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3134.086,3172.883,"--I am not concerned about falling back in this case, because I believe that anyone who reads the report of the Senate, the report of the House conferees, and the Kaple Commission report, will find that it is perfectly clear what Congress intended to do, that Congress did not mean to limit... to distribute costs according to the three tiers for which UPS contends in this case, that Congress in fact explicitly rejected the system of fully distributed costs for which Petitioners are contending, that Congress meant to require only as a minimum that incremental or long-run variable costs be attributed to each class of mail."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.773,3176.709,May I interrupt?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3182.785,3203.526,"--The reason I keep slipping with respect to that sort of example is that at least in this rate proceeding, and in the ones which have preceded it, as a matter of fact, the kinds of costs which are specific to only one class of mail have been relatively minor."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.945,3215.334,"No, but we are talking about concepts now."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3232.562,3234.406,"It is a slip of the tongue when I do that, because--"
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.406,3235.717,"Well, but which is your view?"
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3235.717,3237.373,--The government's view--
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.373,3240.81,Is the fixed cost required to be allocated in the example you gave?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3240.81,3244.244,"--Fixed costs, if they are specific to a particular class of mail."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.244,3248.243,"All right, so it is a broader category than the way you have defined it."
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3248.243,3249.009,Yes.
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.895,3382.064,What is your view of the proper percentage that should be allocated?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3382.064,3390.217,"It is difficult to say what the proper percentage is, because it depends on studies which the Postal Service is continually making to identify costs."
1982.81-1304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.374,3502.952,May I ask one more question before you sit down?
1982.81-1304,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3507.231,3518.976,"The service believes that the allocation of service-related costs is not proper, although the service believes that it is not forbidden by the Act."
1982.81-1304,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3598.538,3602.474,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Segal?"
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3604.691,3616.874,"May it please the Court, obviously, I cannot in four minutes answer, and you will have to rely on our briefs."
1982.81-1304,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3860.229,3870.288,"Well, there is no reason why the Postal Service should feel obliged to follow the decision of one of eleven courts of appeals, when its actions can be reviewed in all eleven?"
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3870.288,3872.896,That court has said we will never fix a rate.
1982.81-1304,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3890.514,3892.621,"I read them, and I didn't find any reluctance."
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3894.23,3939.65,"--Well, I must say to Your Honor that in my judgment, and there is... which I have here... there is a specific statement, we have no power to send this back with any decision as to any rate, and what they are trying to do is to get the Postal Service to do its job, to exercise its discretion within the rules, and I suggest to this Court that it is not following the rules, and if Judge Meskel's opinion can prevail whereby only 50 percent is required, but you can go to 100 percent if you want, 120 percent, that kind of discretion certainly--"
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3939.65,3948.49,"Mr. Segal, you seem to be... you and the government read the court of appeals opinion for the Second Circuit considerably differently."
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3955.55,3963.483,"--Well, Mr. Garvey says that it doesn't apply, the short-term."
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3965.998,3969.575,"Well, but let's assume that we read it the way he reads it."
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3969.575,3970.575,You can't read it that way.
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3970.575,3971.028,"Well, I know, but--"
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3971.028,3971.278,But let's assume that.
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3971.981,3972.044,--Yes.
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3979.651,3981.384,But I have got a sentence to the contrary.
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3981.384,3981.868,"Well, that may be."
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3981.868,3982.118,All right.
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3982.118,3985.898,But assume that is the correct reading of it.
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3993.333,3997.176,Mr. Garvey--
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3997.176,3998.769,--Then you are just disagreeing with what his--
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,3998.769,3999.502,--Mr. Garvey hasn't said a word--
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3999.502,4005.421,--Then you would just be disagreeing with what the long-term variable costs are.
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,4005.421,4008.42,"--Long-term variable isn't enough, Your Honor."
1982.81-1304,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4040.939,4051.778,"Well, if we read the Second Circuit's opinion the way you do, then what we have is that one of the litigants before them now in effect confesses error."
1982.81-1304,3,18058,bernard_g_segal,,4056.011,4074.284,"Justice White, there is a footnote to the brief, very remarkable, I think, of the Solicitor General, which says that the Commission now agrees with the opinion of the Second Circuit."
1982.81-1304,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4091.855,4095.276,Very well.
