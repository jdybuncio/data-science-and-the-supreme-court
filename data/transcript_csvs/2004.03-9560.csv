2004.03-9560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.194,We'll hear argument in Howell against Mississippi.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,55.068,58.7,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.706,94.615,Where--
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,94.615,95.358,--where they're labeled as such--
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.358,97.01,--where was that... where was that maintained?
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,112.076,139.819,"--Justice Ginsburg, we believe that the rule in Beck establishes that State law must be viewed and State law is the determiner of whether an offense is a lesser-included offense, but Federal law, the Federal Constitution determines whether, as a matter of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Eighth Amendment concerns, whether an instruction must be given as a Federal constitutional matter."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,139.819,171.481,"And... and the standards under Beck are different from the standards under the roughly comparable State rule, as I understand it, because under the State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a... a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the Federal standard, simply raising the State standard wouldn't do it."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,171.481,182.96,"Respectfully, Justice Souter, we would submit that Mississippi's own law says that it embraces the Beck standard and that Mississippi's own law--"
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,182.96,196.744,"Sure, it embraces it because it's broader, which means that if you raise... if you... if you make a claim under the State standard, you are not necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more restrictive Federal standard."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,196.744,222.274,"--We would respectfully submit that... that in Mississippi, for example, as contrasted with the statutory scheme that was present in Hopkins, the Nebraska scheme, in the Mississippi scheme, Mississippi has held that simple murder is a lesser-included offense, and therefore, by definition that offense at least mirrors what is required under Beck."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.487,237.794,"What about... what about the... the Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction, there must be a choice between... the jury must be confined to a choice between death and acquittal?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,237.794,238.992,--In--
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.992,241.388,"That's... that's not the same in the State's scheme, is it?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,241.388,243.617,"--Well, we believe that... that it is the same."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.741,281.262,"Is... is Goodin the case that... that stands for the proposition that under... under State law, the... the jury has an... an option to sentence for life, as... as well as... as to impose the death sentence?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,281.262,294.431,"Goodin is the case that the State cited for that purpose, but an analysis of what the Mississippi Supreme Court actually said at page 656 of the Southern Reporter, 787, is this."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,325.351,328.323,So... so I just want to make sure I know where we stand.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,350.076,351.44,"No, I do not believe that is incorrect."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.54,383.141,"But it takes you out of Beck, at least arguably, doesn't it?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,396.516,410.512,"--Your Honor, we would respectfully disagree with that position because of the analysis that the Court has undertaken, for example, in Hopkins and because of the analysis in Spaziano v. Florida."
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.144,427.025,But the consequence of the jury verdict was... was the death penalty.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,427.025,430.286,"--Well, the consequence of the jury verdict may have been the death penalty."
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.35,476.642,"Mr. Mitchell, my... my problem is even more fundamental than Justice Souter's."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,521.019,531.589,"I do not believe that I would have unless in that particular State, if its highest court had said, we embrace the same standard and we apply the same--"
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.589,541.287,"That's all it takes for the New York State Supreme Court, for example, to have said, well, you know, our... our wire-tap statute does the same thing as the Fourth Amendment does anyway?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,541.908,542.773,--I believe--
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.773,546.738,"And thereafter, all you have to do is cite the New York State statute, and you've raised a Federal question."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,546.738,548.157,"--No, respectfully, Your Honor."
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.448,585.005,"Well, I mean, if... but the State standard always has to... has to comply with the Federal requirement, doesn't it?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,585.005,599.698,"It always has to comply with the... with the Federal requirement, but as Justice Souter pointed out, it may be broader, for example, in situations where there might be a right to a... a jury instruction on a lesser-related offense."
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.864,612.141,"So all it takes is a... is a single decision by the State supreme court which says that our rule is no broader than the Federal constitutional requirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal to State law."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,612.141,624.59,"--Well, while we believe that is minimally sufficient, we believe that thereafter it is important certainly to raise a claim which puts the court on notice of a--"
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.59,624.84,Of course--
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,624.84,625.062,--claim.
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.062,625.45,--it does.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,643.349,655.981,"Where... where it is generally understood, as in this case, that the two claims are interwoven, we believe the jurisdiction of this Court, as the Court has said, is plain."
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.981,659.779,So we have to figure out in every case whether the two claims are interwoven.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,663.866,668.408,"I think counsel for the defense would, indeed, contend that they were interwoven."
2004.03-9560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.408,672.699,"I don't think it's too much to ask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a Federal question."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,674.64,693.688,"The... the difficulty in saying that we... that we raise a Federal question is that suppose, in this instance, the trial counsel and appellate counsel, Mr. Lott, had said, the jury in this case is presented with an untenable position, convicting of a capital offense or acquitting."
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.812,739.201,"I mean, my goodness, all it requires... look, the problem is not a technical problem."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,790.554,800.298,"And... and we would concede that but for the fact that in this particular instance, this particular rule is so clearly identifiable."
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.298,817.88,"But it isn't even because, after all, Beck talked about an instruction where the choice was either convict the person of murder, death penalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve an instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give him a life sentence or acquit him."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,823.415,837.094,"Well, Your Honor, we would respectfully submit suppose that the... that Howell's counsel here had called this a Schad issue, for example, where a sentencing scheme somewhat similar to the present--"
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,837.094,842.772,I don't even know... I am so ignorant I don't even know if Schad is a Federal case or a State case.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,842.772,843.515,--And... and--
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.515,849.997,"So I guess if he had, he should have said Fed. or U.S. or whatever it is so that I'll know."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,849.997,851.317,--Or... or suppose--
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.317,852.432,That doesn't seem like such a burden.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,852.432,853.053,--Or... or--
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.053,853.712,I... I wrote it.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,854.168,859.202,--But Justice Souter--
2004.03-9560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.202,862.174,Justice Souter was... was a State court judge as well.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,863.0,870.348,"--Suppose, though, that this were not... were not a... a lesser-included instruction case."
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,891.031,891.607,Supreme Court?
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,893.67,894.042,--Well--
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.042,895.694,Maybe he meant the State supreme court.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,895.694,896.52,--Maybe he meant the State supreme court.
2004.03-9560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.52,896.753,All right.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,917.78,932.641,"No, but we would say... we would say this, Your Honor, that the effort to federalize the claim as was done in the Mississippi Supreme Court was done in an effort to address the instructions as a whole, and--"
2004.03-9560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.641,936.356,"Well, it isn't even clear here that Beck would have been violated."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,945.605,946.925,--We would concede that.
2004.03-9560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.238,949.897,Yes.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,954.81,994.563,"It would be our contention, Your Honor, that... that Spaziano v. Florida, that Schad, and the cases following Beck, Hopkins v. Nebraska even would, of necessity... or Hopkins v. Reeves... I'm sorry... the Nebraska scheme... would, of necessity, report to the court the continuing vitality of Beck even under these circumstances, but it... it is a matter that we believe was at least made fairly and reasonably presented to the court."
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,994.563,1008.059,"Mr. Mitchell, what gives me pause is that there are Mississippi cases... you no doubt know them... where the court has seemed to think that the Federal issue under Beck was discrete from the State issue."
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1039.637,1046.696,"Justice Ginsburg, we would respectfully submit that... that the State's recitation of Goodin is not a faithful representation of what happened in Goodin."
2004.03-9560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.375,1291.74,"May I ask you this question, Mr. Mitchell?"
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1333.683,1343.714,--We would respectfully submit that... that even the Mississippi court has addressed that situation in... in a case cited in... in the briefs in Mease.
2004.03-9560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1374.8,1376.658,Is... is that the case here too?
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1420.946,1423.614,We... we believe that it does raise it adequately.
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1425.271,1427.617,But then what would be a lesser-included offense?
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1438.974,1440.089,"--We do contend that it was right, Your Honor."
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.089,1440.915,--and the judge was obliged to give it.
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1450.657,1463.494,"We believe that... that there are, in effect, two forms of simple murder because of the structure of... and in fact, the Mississippi Supreme Court has said this... because of the structure of the Mississippi murder definitions."
2004.03-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1489.501,1491.442,But what would be if it were not?
2004.03-9560,0,40054,ronnie_m_mitchell,,1495.24,1497.014,Arguably it would be manslaughter.
2004.03-9560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.141,1568.884,You may.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1575.655,1578.627,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.554,1694.297,I don't get your point.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1696.982,1698.551,"--Yes, yes, sir--"
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.551,1699.09,--so long as it's a lesser offense?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1699.09,1699.749,--Justice Scalia.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.155,1734.013,"May I interrupt with a question there, General Cox?"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1734.013,1734.55,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.55,1745.901,"In this case, if the man approached the victim in the car and shot him and killed him, as I understand it, and the theory was an attempted robbery and therefore the... the capital offense."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1751.557,1753.415,"No, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1758.04,1761.755,But why wasn't he entitled to an instruction on whatever offense it was?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1761.755,1769.307,Because the... the facts in this case show that there was no other reason for him to approach that vehicle than to rob that individual.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.876,1777.109,"But his theory was if there was a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that all was left was a... a killing for some other reason."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1788.337,1789.906,"Yes, sir, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.906,1791.642,So what your theory is then--
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1791.642,1791.864,It depends on--
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.864,1798.329,"--if I understand it correctly, is the proof that there was an attempted robbery is so convincing that no other theory was available."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1798.329,1801.135,"--Well, that's the facts that we had in this case."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.36,1820.249,But I still don't understand your answer to Justice Stevens' question.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1849.106,1852.283,"--Yes, sir, it is."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.881,1867.932,"But... but would the State of Mississippi take the position that if there was no robbery, there was no crime in this case--"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1867.932,1868.508,"--No, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1868.508,1869.54,--when a man is shot and killed?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1869.54,1876.31,"On the facts that we had, if... if you analyze it under the Federal standard... and I would submit to the Court that we should apply--"
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.31,1876.782,No.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1888.487,1891.338,--We don't know... he didn't know this defendant.
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.338,1896.455,"No, no, but the question is suppose we have a different case, not this case."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1908.921,1911.233,"Well, first--"
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.233,1912.902,I've told you everything about the case.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1920.854,1921.009,--Which crime.
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.009,1922.002,Okay?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1922.002,1922.207,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.724,1925.633,So which crime is it?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1925.633,1930.669,--Based upon the facts that we had... and he didn't know this individual.
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.527,1932.899,Right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1932.899,1933.642,It would not be murder.
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.642,1933.975,No.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1935.256,1941.079,"It could arguably be a felony murder, which is a separate statute in Mississippi."
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1941.079,1941.283,All right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1942.109,1943.018,He meant to commit another--
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.018,1943.474,--Is anything else possible?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1943.474,1944.338,--another crime.
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.338,1946.074,Manslaughter?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1946.074,1947.643,Well--
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.643,1953.876,"I mean, it's odd that in Mississippi people just go around shooting each other all the time and there's no statute that seems to cover it."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1953.876,1955.917,"And if you don't know someone, then it's not murder?"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1956.643,1957.386,"--Oh, yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.584,1959.077,All right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,1960.646,1961.927,"But, of course, it's premeditation."
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.33,1963.952,"--No, no, no."
2004.03-9560,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.584,1982.9,"Let's make it... if we make it concrete, let's take all that we have in this case is the testimony that Rice gave."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2022.902,2032.478,"--Justice Ginsburg, to... to... first of all, we wouldn't have indicted for capital murder if we didn't have that evidence."
2004.03-9560,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2049.213,2051.032,"Yes, but I'm giving you a hypothetical where--"
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.032,2052.063,"General Scott, I suggest you try to answer her question."
2004.03-9560,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2052.063,2052.436,--Yes.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.179,2054.915,The question is that's... one witness is all you had.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2058.463,2062.094,"--It would be manslaughter, I suppose, Your Honor."
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.318,2065.811,--Okay.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2100.528,2102.114,--There--
2004.03-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.114,2104.821,And don't take the one I just suggested because I'm not sure that's right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2107.15,2112.212,"--There are 12 separate manslaughter sections in the Mississippi code, not in one section."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2136.444,2137.763,"Well, is that fatal to him?"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2142.427,2144.079,--His failure to request--
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.079,2150.972,"Under Mississippi law, would he be entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he asked for the wrong lesser offense?"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2161.374,2171.034,"--Perhaps the judge should correct within a particular statute, but not go look at all 12 statutes that he's under... which... which would classify as murder."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.034,2173.346,So you say he's not entitled then.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2173.346,2174.172,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.172,2182.445,"The... the only thing he would be entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesser instruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct, there's no error."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2182.445,2183.915,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.716,2191.882,No.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.938,2199.889,"And under your view of the facts, as I understand it, he would have been entitled to a manslaughter instruction."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2199.889,2204.68,--I don't... that's only a stretch to answer... answer Justice Breyer's question.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.68,2210.086,"Well, surely... surely, if one walks up to a car and shoots the driver dead, that's must be a crime."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2210.086,2210.746,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.315,2220.406,"And the question is we don't know exactly which of your several statutory provisions it violated, but if it violated one of them, I don't understand."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2238.693,2250.294,"--I... I believe what he was addressing was language within a particular statute, meaning a lesser-included offense of... of murder or how you styled it, whether it be depraved heart murder or... or felony murder, first degree murder."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.294,2253.349,So it's... it's your view he must ask for the correct lesser-included offense instruction.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2253.349,2254.297,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.33,2326.167,But is sudden provocation or heat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part of his... one of the... is it a matter of defense?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2326.167,2330.292,--It would be a matter of the defense raising sudden provocation.
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2365.837,2368.725,--May I go back to the heat of passion point?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2403.193,2406.703,"He could have asked for a heat of passion instruction, but--"
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2406.703,2407.651,"Okay, but he did not do so."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2407.651,2408.273,--but he did not do so.
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.099,2409.265,Wait.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2417.151,2419.956,"--It's sudden provocation, yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.956,2423.3,Suppose you walk up and... and you blow somebody away.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2439.236,2439.896,"No, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.889,2442.413,Why isn't it enough that you killed somebody?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2442.413,2443.899,--If... if--
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.899,2444.725,You killed somebody.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2453.187,2454.18,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.552,2455.128,What is it?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2455.128,2457.069,--charge murder and... and the prosecution--
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.069,2457.357,No.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2464.954,2476.926,"--Likely, the State would... would have... have... if those were the facts and that's all the facts that we had, then the State would likely have charged murder and asked for a lesser-included offense instruction for manslaughter."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2476.926,2480.391,Manslaughter being defined as killing without deliberation?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2480.391,2481.217,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2481.217,2481.756,Okay.
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.786,2486.213,There... there is a... you say there... there are what?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2487.699,2488.813,Twelve different manslaughter--
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.813,2495.501,"Twelve different, and one of them is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any provocation."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2496.244,2497.154,"--Yes, sir, without."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.282,2525.305,"Well, let... let me ask... ask you this."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2539.257,2545.367,--There are two possibilities that were not requested.
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.027,2579.714,"May I ask this question just to help me sort of... what are the... as a matter of State law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was convicted?"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2579.714,2593.543,"Elements of the offense are that he... that he... a killing occurred with or without intent and that it was in the commission of... of a crime, robbery."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.543,2593.726,Those are the two elements.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2601.428,2606.795,With or without under Mississippi law--
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.795,2610.882,"In other words, you say... you say the offenses are killing somebody with or without the intent to do so--"
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2610.882,2611.254,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.254,2613.195,--and in the course of an attempted felony.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2621.369,2624.879,It... if you... if you prove the intent--
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.879,2626.448,"--And if he is, why isn't it a lesser-included offense is my next question."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2626.448,2626.737,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.277,2646.239,"It seems to me that then there are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would have... he should have gotten an instruction on both."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2646.239,2646.982,I... I--
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.982,2648.368,And I don't understand why not.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2648.368,2649.649,"--Yes, sir, I understand."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2763.084,2763.639,--May... may I ask you?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2769.483,2769.733,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2769.733,2771.424,And tell me if I'm right or wrong at each step.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2785.42,2785.913,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2785.913,2786.451,All right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2835.658,2838.054,"There again, Your Honor--"
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2838.054,2853.119,"Because what he's saying is, I'm asking for an instruction on an offense which is lesser... it does not... it's an offense that doesn't include the course of the crime, but it does include the other elements."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2861.869,2863.893,"--No, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2869.466,2869.716,Yes.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2890.643,2893.205,"--No, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2896.01,2896.67,All right.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2898.073,2899.354,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2899.354,2913.305,"Under... under... as I understood... as I understood you to define the capital offense, the State could prove the capital offense by saying he did have intent when he killed and he also happened to be committing a crime."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2916.899,2919.044,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2920.819,2926.846,"I thought you said that on the capital offense, the killing could be with or without intent."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2926.846,2927.135,Right.
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2927.135,2927.773,I... I--
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2927.773,2928.871,I think you confuse us by saying that.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2938.243,2938.736,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.736,2942.617,"So if you want to get plain murder, you're adding an element."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2942.617,2943.006,Right.
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.006,2953.968,"It has to be murder with intent, and that's why you say it's not a lesser-included offense because for plain murder, you need intent, and for felony murder, you don't need intent."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2953.968,2955.166,"Thank you, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.166,2956.159,Isn't that... isn't that your case?
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2956.159,2956.409,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2956.409,2968.026,"--So that the Mississippi law for felony murder is killing, pure and simple, plus crime, and simple murder is killing plus intent."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2971.779,2973.06,"Yes, sir, on a felony--"
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.06,2973.348,Okay.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,2997.664,3000.569,"--Yes, sir, and that's why I would submit to the Court it distinguishes--"
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3000.569,3001.379,Okay.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3004.973,3005.649,"--Yes, sir."
2004.03-9560,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.649,3006.003,Okay.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3006.003,3031.721,"I'd like to also point out factually that in the... in the... initially in the petition, the... and actually at trial and at the Mississippi Supreme Court, they talked about that the defendant may have been able... may have been out there selling drugs to the defendant."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.455,3129.347,"Well, but... but it is true that... that there's a difference between becoming eligible for the death penalty, on the one hand, and not being eligible on the other."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3140.659,3146.149,"--Justice Stevens, I... I would respectfully disagree."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.575,3169.859,--an offense for which the death penalty is the punishment.
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3169.859,3182.436,"Yes, sir, but it doesn't impact the guilt phase, and that was what the problem was, I believe, in Beck, was that... that a jury might not... they don't want to turn him loose because... and they give him a conviction, which automatically carries the death penalty."
2004.03-9560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.443,3213.022,"No, but if the jurors' concern is that you either have to acquit them or... we want to make sure he never walks out of prison again, and the only way to do that is to convict him of a capital offense so the judge can impose the death penalty."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3217.109,3220.37,"Well, maybe I don't understand the question correctly."
2004.03-9560,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3244.23,3253.685,"Well, it seems to me that works against you because it takes away from the jury the option of saying, well, we'll convict him of a serious offense, but we'll be sure not to give him a capital offense."
2004.03-9560,1,30721,james_m_hood_iii,,3256.862,3261.941,"Well, Justice Kennedy, in Mississippi, we have, there again, that open standard, not the Federal standard."
