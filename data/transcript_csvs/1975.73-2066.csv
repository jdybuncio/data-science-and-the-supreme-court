1975.73-2066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.029,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 73-2066, the National Independent Coal Operators’ Association against the Secretary of the Interior and the consolidated case, the Secretary of Interior against Delta Mining Company."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,25.187,55.643,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, these consolidated cases present a single legal issue as to whether the Bureau of Mines of the Department of Interior in assessing civil penalties for alleged violations of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act followed strictly the procedural requirements spelled out by Congress in the Act."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.075,368.372,"Mr. Kilcullen, isn’t your version of what Congress provided here rather elaborate by the standards of normal administrative law?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,379.898,381.952,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.513,407.625,"Well, he has an opportunity for an adjudication if he wants one."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,407.625,432.402,"But the statute says that the Secretary must apply these criteria in making a determination and unless he has done so, the operator’s failure to request a hearing does not validate or does not cure a Secretary’s failure to comply with the statute."
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,464.6,469.7,"But if he requests a hearing without law, the procedure goes in, right?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,469.7,472.701,"Yes, sir, that initiates the hearing procedure and then the --"
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,472.701,477.08,"Well, why did he not do that?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,477.08,480.272,Your question is why did not the operators request a hearing?
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,480.272,481.442,"Yes, sir."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,481.442,494.413,"I cannot answer that question other than to say that the operators undoubtedly felt that these orders were not in accordance with the statutory procedure, that the orders were not valid orders."
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.413,498.051,"It would not cost him anything to send a note, would it?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,498.051,501.283,"Well, in every one of these cases -- Your Honor, in every one of these cases --"
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.283,505.618,All he had to do was to send a note and say “we want a hearing.”
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,505.618,527.02,"In every one of these cases, the operator protested, filed a protest with the Assessment Officer and sent in material to establish that the circumstances of the violation were set to the penalty -- it sets should not be --"
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.02,530.68,"Just like a lawyer’s fight, he just wants to try this out."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,530.68,531.482,Sorry.
1975.73-2066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.482,540.003,"It is a lawyer’s fight; he just wants to try the statute out, when all you have to do was send in one little piece of paper saying “I request a hearing.”"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,540.003,543.768,"Well, I do not know whether you are correct in saying it is a lawyer’s fight."
1975.73-2066,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,588.544,600.448,"Mr. Kilcullen, are the operators really claiming that they do not know what these alleged violations consist of or are they really arguing mitigation here?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,600.448,602.566,"Mitigation, Your Honor?"
1975.73-2066,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,629.975,633.964,Is that not the reason for requesting a hearing then?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,633.964,662.268,"Well, the Secretary originally set up a procedure whereby, in each case, the matter would be sent to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, and then the Bureau of Mines had to file a petition for an assessment within which they would spell out the circumstances, all of the factual background, and so on."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.471,732.769,"But the Mine Inspector did make an effort to find out whether a violation had occurred, did he not?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,732.769,742.065,"Well, he found a situation which he considered to be a violation but that does not prove the existence of a violation."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.596,765.946,And that sort of a hearing was opened to any of your clients on request.
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,765.946,768.666,"They could go to a hearing, right."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.495,791.371,"Well, you say it was not based upon a determination of the existence of a violation."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,800.059,805.091,"There is not Adjudicative Officer in this procedure, Your Honor."
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.076,819.606,Call it then that why is the Assessment Officer then entitled to take their finding of the Mine Safety Inspector?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,819.606,821.723,Why is he not entitled to take it?
1975.73-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.285,839.926,"Would you say it has to be proved twice then in a course of an administrative hearing, first, at the preliminary stage and then, if a hearing is requested, again?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,839.926,841.653,"No, sir, I do not understand."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.394,907.491,"You mean even if the mine operator had, in writing, expressly purported to dispense with a need for a hearing or with findings?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,907.491,922.316,"He could pay the penalty and settle the case and not at that level if he wished, but if he did not wish to pay this penalty he filed, in these cases, as we have indicated, he filed a protest."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.273,942.427,Did you rest on any constitutional argument below?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,944.606,946.548,"We did, in fact, make the constitutional argument, there was --"
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.548,948.973,"That was rejected too, I take it."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,948.973,956.711,"No, the District Court held in our favor in each case and the Third Circuit held in our favor in the one case."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.52,962.424,Now did they reject the constitutional argument?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,962.424,964.76,They did not consider the constitutional argument.
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.88,979.104,"Well, are you pressing a constitutional claim here?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,979.104,986.515,"Well, it is the question of due process of law I think is a proper question here."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.515,988.198,So your answer is yes?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,988.198,991.672,"Yes, sir."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.672,996.067,"You did not ask for a post-assessment hearing either, I take it."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,999.655,1000.804,"Well, that is a question."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.522,1009.429,Let us assume you could have.
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1016.066,1031.025,"This would come up in a situation where the Secretary goes into the District Court for enforcement as he did in the Delta Mining cases, and the operator then says “I think this order of the Secretary is invalid."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.06,1040.303,"It was available to you, was it not?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1040.303,1061.279,"No, the Government said in the Delta Mining case, in the pre-trial conference, the Government contended that this de novo trial provision of the statute does not give the operator the right to adjudicate the fact of the violation."
1975.73-2066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.909,1066.336,Because its failure to exhaust?
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1066.336,1068.655,"Well, they did not spell it out in those forms."
1975.73-2066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.056,1093.894,"Mr. Kilcullen, if you are reading from the record, where we will find it.?"
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1093.894,1096.323,"I have it right here, I believe."
1975.73-2066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1149.631,1152.81,"Mr. Kilcullen, I think you are getting into Mr. Blackwell’s time now."
1975.73-2066,0,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1152.81,1153.419,"Yes, sir."
1975.73-2066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.907,1184.711,Very well.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1187.378,1193.162,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.73-2066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1387.204,1397.827,But was that not in part because it is the Government’s position that there was no occasion absent a request for hearing?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1397.827,1416.919,"That is the Government -- the Government’s position is that there is a distinction in the penalty assessment procedure in a hearing and a non-hearing situation, that the statute simply does not contain such a distinction."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1474.175,1478.518,"Mr. Blackwell, If you would have had the hearing, how long would have it taken?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1478.518,1486.114,"The hearing in these cases could have taken, well, the estimate -- pardon?"
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.114,1487.497,About a year?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1487.497,1488.746,"No, not a year, sir."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1488.746,1490.462,But pretty close.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1490.462,1490.682,Pardon?
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.682,1491.643,Pretty close to a year.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1491.643,1493.154,To a year?
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.154,1494.448,Yes.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1494.448,1498.276,"The hearing in the Delta and G. M. W. -- no, I cannot agree with that at all, Your Honor."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.276,1501.601,Then how long?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1501.601,1506.203,"Three to five or seven days I would say, at the outside."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.203,1508.162,And when would it be decided?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1508.162,1512.762,"When would it have been decided? Well, if the Hearing Examiner is not too --"
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1512.762,1516.976,Do you meant to tell me that if you ask or a hearing you get one within three days?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1516.976,1517.383,I thought-- excuse me.
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1517.383,1520.15,I have never seen a government agency doing that in history.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1520.15,1522.068,"Excuse me, I misunderstood you."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.612,1530.263,"No, that is what I meant; when would it be finished?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1530.263,1537.929,"Well, the administrative hearing, if it had been asked, could have been concluded I say within a year after these assessments."
1975.73-2066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1537.929,1540.804,At the same time we have here.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1545.39,1547.661,"No, I am not complaining about a year."
1975.73-2066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.037,1599.24,"How would you compare this, Mr. Blackwell, with the traffic violation where the traffic violation is asserted in the notice and where you can get a trial if you want, if you do not ask for a trial the penalty is automatic?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1599.24,1602.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that is correct."
1975.73-2066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.876,1669.292,"In some situations, traffic citation or driving under the influence of liquor might have, if not a $10,000-impact, a very large impact but does not that same procedure prevail?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1669.292,1672.324,"Well, I see your interest in that area, Your Honor."
1975.73-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.384,1742.562,"Mr. Blackwell, do you have objections to the new regulation?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1742.562,1744.508,Your Honor --
1975.73-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.508,1756.099,"I understand they do not solve the problem of past assessments, but do we have any problem in this case that is to the future validity of a set of regulations?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1756.099,1761.844,"In this case, those new regulations are not involved at all, Your Honor."
1975.73-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.875,1767.84,These old regulations that we are arguing about have been replaced.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1767.84,1780.483,They have been replaced and I have had no reason to study those to make even a speculative judgment on their validity or non-validity.
1975.73-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.483,1783.094,Then what the issue here with the past assessments then?
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1783.094,1784.253,That is right.
1975.73-2066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.336,1837.911,If we had before us just the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit I suppose there would be a serious question of mootness whether since all you sought in that action was to enjoin the operation of these procedures.
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1837.911,1853.653,"Well, I think you have a serious question of mootness in any event and the only thing that might save it is the Government’s 2,000 cases distributed to the District Attorneys all over the country that they say they want to enforce."
1975.73-2066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.653,1868.258,"Well, does that not resolve the mootness issue as to the Third Circuit’s case though where there you did have an effort to enforce these penalties and the Government seeks to enforce them regardless of the effect of these new rules?"
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1871.109,1878.594,"No, I say that is what prevents, the 2,000 cases prevent the mootness."
1975.73-2066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.594,1885.147,"Your time has expired, Mr. Blackwell."
1975.73-2066,1,23657,fred_blackwell,,1885.147,1896.968,"I may just include, Gentlemen, the Third Circuit had all of these arguments before this, as well as the D.C. Court of Appeals may have rendered its decision."
1975.73-2066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.968,1898.77,Mr. Randolph.
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,1898.77,1901.703,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.73-2066,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.452,1950.461,Why does the declaratory judgment aspect change the mootness question?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,1950.461,1965.269,"Well, if the regulations are held invalid, then the argument, and the argument indeed was in Delta Mining, that therefore the penalties assessed under those regulations are invalid as well, and if those penalties assessed are invalid then enforcement actions cannot be sought and must be dismissed."
1975.73-2066,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1969.66,1974.421,Was it that the regulations were invalid or was it that the construction of what the regulation say and mean?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,1974.421,1978.991,"No, the regulations were held invalid in the Delta Mining case."
1975.73-2066,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.1,2609.173,Are you going to deal with the conjunctive language in Section 109 (a) (3) which seems to cut against your point?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,2609.173,2612.308,Yes.
1975.73-2066,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2858.491,2861.221,"Mr. Randolph, could I interrupt you here?"
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,2883.0,2885.473,"I have a couple of answers to that, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.73-2066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.553,3077.743,This is the last -- Page 20?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3077.743,3080.059,"I am sorry, pages 24-25."
1975.73-2066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3080.059,3080.835,Of what?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3080.835,3082.041,Of our brief.
1975.73-2066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3082.041,3083.515,Of your Delta brief?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3083.515,3090.423,"Yes, the other brief did not go that high."
1975.73-2066,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3380.858,3382.351,Be brought in Court?
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3382.351,3383.334,Yes.
1975.73-2066,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.334,3395.799,"Well, but it is certainly not unknown to administrative law even where you have a trial de novo to require some sort of procedural safeguards in the administrative proceeding in some sort of an administrative record."
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3395.799,3401.988,"I think that, in light of the system that is now set up that there are administrative safeguards."
1975.73-2066,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.329,3407.731,But that was not the argument you were making a minute ago.
1975.73-2066,2,38517,randolph,,3414.581,3424.376,"I said it does not make any difference whether the findings of fact were adequate enough, detailed enough, because the Court in an enforcement action cannot rely upon them anyway."
1975.73-2066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3572.472,3573.407,"Thank you, Mr. Randolph."

1975.73-2066,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.194,3579.728,I beg your pardon?
1975.73-2066,3,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,3579.728,3580.893,You say my time has been used up?
1975.73-2066,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3580.893,3583.107,It has been used completely.

1975.73-2066,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3583.567,3590.684,"Unless you have some statement with reference to factual matters as distinguished from legal argument, your time has expired."
1975.73-2066,3,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,3590.684,3594.651,"I thought I had reserved some time, apparently not."
