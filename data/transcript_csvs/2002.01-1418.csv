2002.01-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.082,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 01-1418, A. Elliott Archer versus Arlene L. Warner."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,10.031,13.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.623,111.334,"Is it your understanding that if the Fourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in this case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing rule in all of the States, or would certain States differ on whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when there was a settlement agreement?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,113.153,114.306,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.818,134.906,"Well, my... my question, perhaps, was not as clear as it ought to have been."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,170.822,177.342,"Your Honor, the court of appeals did, indeed, say that the... the settlement effected a novation."
2002.01-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.741,199.057,"I'm... I'm well aware of that, but what I'm just asking is... this case came from South Carolina, was it?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,199.057,200.915,"From North Carolina, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.915,201.908,"Oh, from North Carolina."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,201.908,202.28,Yes.
2002.01-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.28,211.446,Is the North Carolina rule about novations and settlements the majority rule for most of the States?
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,213.692,214.706,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.171,249.712,"Mr. Goldblatt, I take it you're saying, yeah, a novation is fine with you."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,262.798,267.606,"It was an immediate payment of $200,000 and a promissory note for $100,000."
2002.01-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.606,272.252,And that's... that's what they... they say is the basis of their claim in bankruptcy.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,306.803,312.626,"Your Honor, Leonard Warner stipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him."
2002.01-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.889,352.257,"But does that mean that... let's say the Fourth Circuit is affirmed, that you could still, post-bankruptcy, go after Mr. Warner because he stipulated that the debt as to him was nondischargeable?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,352.257,358.323,"I... I believe that... that's a final and unappealable order at this point, and yes, that's right, of course."
2002.01-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.038,440.889,"Well, of course, there it wasn't just the underlying debt."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,452.421,458.82,"--Well, yes, Justice Stevens, that's right, and here what... what petitioners seek to do is go behind the settlement agreement--"
2002.01-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,458.82,459.358,--Yes.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,459.358,460.844,--and see what the settlement actually resolved.
2002.01-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.844,484.249,"Supposing the settlement... they had gone along with the settlement, and then they came up with a... a third proposal where the debtor said, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to meet my obligations, but I've got another proposal, we'll go in the joint venture to do something else and we'll release the contract claim and substitute a third, could you go... still continue to go behind to find out what the original source of the debt was?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,484.249,486.312,Yes.
2002.01-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.388,499.998,"So even if, say, they had five or six different transactions, each of which purported to be a complete substitute for the deal they had just been unable to... you can always go... say, Well, the whole thing started because you cheated me out of something?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,499.998,511.681,"Well... well, for each particular debt that one asserts is nondischargeable, the creditor bears the burden of proving in bankruptcy that that debt arises out of an act of fraud."
2002.01-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.681,513.744,Directly or indirectly out of.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,513.744,520.059,"That's right, but nevertheless, under Brown versus Felsen, that is the creditor's--"
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.059,522.743,Suppose I have an indebtedness.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,537.521,544.208,"--If the original indebtedness arises out of an act of fraud, Justice Scalia, then... then yes, it is all debt--"
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.208,557.006,"Anything that happens later is... that... that wouldn't have happened but for the original indebtedness is, within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, traceable to the fraud?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,557.006,562.867,"--Justice Scalia, we... we certainly acknowledge that there must be some principle of, say, proximate causation."
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.867,565.551,"Exactly, and that's all we're talking about here, isn't... isn't it?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,576.325,579.192,There certainly is a principle of proximate causation.
2002.01-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.891,585.696,"Wait, but what about... I mean, this doesn't make too much sense to me."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,618.473,629.164,"--No, Justice Breyer, I'm not suggesting that there is never a point in which the causation becomes too tenuous that you can't prove that the debt that one is contending is--"
2002.01-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.164,630.529,"No, I... absolutely."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,634.077,638.042,--But not... not only is... is the principle of--
2002.01-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.042,641.136,They never would have had this furniture argument but for the debt.
2002.01-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.136,643.698,"Well, you're talking not just about cause, but proximate cause."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,643.698,644.48,--Exactly.
2002.01-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,647.823,650.385,"And what does that mean, proximate cause, then?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,652.736,658.309,"Your Honor, here, all that happened is that the... the form of the debt changed."
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.743,677.711,"In... in connection with that, one side said to the other, I don't care whether this has come out of fraud or not."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,700.951,710.239,"That... that's right, Your Honor, and all a creditor seeks to do in showing a debt as nondischargeable is seeks to enforce the debtor's promise to pay the amount of money given in that settlement."
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.239,714.88,"That's true, but... but here it was... there was no acknowledgement of the fraud."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,727.662,728.116,That's--
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.116,736.207,Why isn't that enough to terminate the proximity necessary for... for nondischargeability in bankruptcy?
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,736.207,738.064,--Just a couple of... of answers.
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.129,779.014,"But doesn't a consent judgment always, at... always hinge upon the existence of a cause of action?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,779.014,782.729,"--Presumably yes, Your Honor, and--"
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.729,784.298,Whereas a settlement doesn't.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,784.298,806.674,"--That's right, and unless the creditor can prove in bankruptcy that the debt that's now reflected in... in the settlement agreement is traceable to an act of fraud, the creditor will lose the nondischargeability action, and the only question is whether the creditor should have the opportunity to establish in bankruptcy that there is, in fact, an act of fraud that... that is reflected in and resolved by the consent judgment."
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.573,832.142,"It doesn't say there's no fraud, but it does say that this indebtedness has nothing to do with whether or not there was fraud."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,833.711,833.928,That's right.
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.0,835.652,--this indebtedness exists.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,840.481,852.454,"--But it is completely silent on the question of whether fraud had occurred, just as the consent judgment in Brown v. Felsen was completely silent on the question whether that debt arose out of contract or fraud."
2002.01-1418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.35,876.807,"Would there be... would there be a difference if the settlement had expressly said, we stipulate that there was no fraud leading to the creation of the debt of... for which this in effect is a... a novation?"
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,876.807,877.179,--Justice Souter--
2002.01-1418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,877.179,877.922,Would that make a difference?
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,877.922,882.835,"--Justice Souter, that would be a much harder case for reasons we set out in... in our briefs."
2002.01-1418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.04,896.088,But your argument here is we don't really have get to bankruptcy policy.
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,901.66,903.806,"That's... that's exactly right, Justice Souter."
2002.01-1418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.131,980.628,"But the traceability does, and that's what we're talking about here, how traceable is traceable."
2002.01-1418,0,19045,craig_goldblatt,,980.628,996.853,"--That's right, Justice Scalia, and with respect to that question there is... there is no difference between a consent judgment that is a final adjudication of the claims between the parties and a settlement agreement, both of which are equally preclusive, both of which are equally silent on the question of whether fraud occurred."
2002.01-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.915,1000.69,"Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1002.138,1012.662,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.782,1046.47,"But the real inquiry in Brown, as I read it, is can we go behind a judgment to see what was actually determined by the judgment."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1050.352,1051.754,--Right.
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.754,1060.233,"And I guess the holding is, yes, you may go behind a judgment to see what was decided, and that seems to me a little different from going behind a settlement."
2002.01-1418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.233,1062.984,"Well, didn't Brown decide two separate issues?"
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1062.984,1065.434,The Court in Brown did two things.
2002.01-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.855,1097.368,"It didn't look to what the Court had decided, but what the claim was about, but here we have something in addition."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1114.169,1118.34,Not... a dismissal with prejudice following a settlement.
2002.01-1418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.26,1146.842,"We're not talking issue preclusion, just... just as far as whether it suffices to terminate the traceability."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1151.034,1177.949,"No, the... the dismissal with prejudice doesn't impair the creditor's right to walk into court and sue to enforce the settlement debt, including the right to try to get the full amount of the settlement debt in bankruptcy, and on this issue of traceability, it... it is not only identical to Brown, but the code by its express terms disclaims any distinction between a liquidated debt and an unliquidated debt."
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.372,1188.146,May I... would you just clear up one thing for me?
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1197.434,1198.344,No.
2002.01-1418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.166,1210.909,"It seems like a strange result, doesn't it?"
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.909,1211.902,I don't understand that.
2002.01-1418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.933,1225.853,"--You conduct this big inquiry and find out that the guy's been defrauded of $300, and then that the settlement agreement really covers up a fraud and you say, Well, but you know, a deal's a deal."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1231.554,1235.102,"I'm sorry, are you talking about the settlement agreement itself was procured by fraud?"
2002.01-1418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.102,1236.671,"No, no, no, no."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1255.143,1257.455,The Court... The Court addressed this very issue in Brown.
2002.01-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.118,1285.281,But... but what's the policy reason behind that.
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1301.749,1306.207,"--The Court in Grogan... it's because of two issues, Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.939,1330.772,"Well, the Fourth... the Fourth Circuit says State law says that this is a novation, too, so... and you're... you don't want us to be bound by that interpretation of State law."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1330.772,1353.639,"The... again, this Court in Grogan versus Carter said that State law determines the amount of the debt, and I just don't think the creditor would have a good faith argument that he could go beyond the settlement agreement, but on the question of nondischargeability, what the creditor is trying to do is collect the entire amount of the debt by... by showing fraud, and we think applying Brown--"
2002.01-1418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1353.639,1371.555,"What their main argument, I think, on the other side is, you get a debt, that's what it is, a debt for money obtained by fraud, and this is not a debt for money obtained by fraud, this is a debt for money owed under a settlement agreement."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1411.352,1414.12,"--Well, this Court already crossed that bridge in Brown."
2002.01-1418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.12,1414.575,"Well, all right, so then maybe Brown was wrong."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1414.575,1415.856,But the second point is that--
2002.01-1418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1415.856,1416.887,Maybe it was wrong.
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1416.887,1425.31,"--Whatever the limits of the traceability point, which this Court addressed in a separate decision, Cohen versus de la Cruz, which dealt with the traceability aspects--"
2002.01-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.31,1426.918,There is no traceability.
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1434.615,1450.49,"--The code itself says that any enforceability obligation, whether or not it's liquidated or unliquidated or appears in a judgment, if you can prove that there has been a fraudulent acquisition of money, the resulting debt is nondischargeable, and that is--"
2002.01-1418,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.49,1457.716,"Ms. Blatt, what is your... what is the Government's position if the parties had expressly dealt with it in the settlement agreement?"
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1457.716,1460.317,--We think the right would be subject to waiver.
2002.01-1418,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.886,1468.656,"So you don't agree with petitioner's counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?"
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1468.656,1471.834,--We think the right can be waived.
2002.01-1418,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1472.66,1484.094,"All right, now, the language in this particular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out of or relating to the matter of the State court litigation."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1486.778,1506.923,"--No, it certainly wasn't a waiver of the right to collect on the debt, and in fact there's an express preservation of not only the right to collect all the obligations under the promissory note, but to collect the amounts under the settlement agreement, and we think to apply a contrary rule, the rule that the court below applied, would be unsound for three reasons."
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.485,1569.172,"But you do agree that some fraud claims could be waived as far as the dischargeability, because you wrote the rights settlement agreement."
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1569.172,1572.599,"Yes, if there was an affirmative manifestation of an intent."
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.599,1576.852,"Why isn't that inconsistent with the statutory policy, just as this case would be?"
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1576.852,1596.83,"Because there is a background presumption, Justice Stevens, that rights are subject to waiver, and so if there's an intentional relinquishment of a Federal statutory right, then a court can give that effect, but not only is there silence on that issue in this case, there is an express reservation of the right to enforce the settlement agreement, and--"
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.83,1598.4,To enforce the settlement agreement.
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1598.4,1599.022,"--Yes, and that includes--"
2002.01-1418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.022,1601.827,But that's not a reservation of the right to sue for fraud.
2002.01-1418,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1601.827,1604.306,--They're not suing for fraud.
2002.01-1418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.545,1620.281,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1622.26,1625.975,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1418,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.349,1669.116,This would have been a release in State court proceedings?
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1669.116,1680.178,"--Correct, Your Honor, and... and that leads to the second point, which is that what is at issue here really is the interpretation of the language, the specific language--"
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1680.178,1684.182,"There's no language about 523, which you just said--"
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1684.182,1684.554,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.554,1686.123,--this is a standard settlement.
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1696.337,1700.878,"Well, Your Honor, I think what you said in terms of the language is certainly correct."
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.647,1737.453,"But isn't... isn't the problem with approaching it that way... I... at least, I think the problem with approaching it that way is that there is no State law analog to the issue that is being raised here."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1752.025,1752.602,Well--
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1752.602,1766.598,"--and I don't know how we get... we... we look to State law to find out whether there is doubt or not, but I don't know why State law should be a source of an answer to this Federal question, which is peculiarly Federal."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1766.598,1780.838,"--Well, I... I don't think, Your Honor, that it is the final answer, but it seems to me it's entirely possible for parties in a State court proceeding to enter into a settlement that says, and we hereby specifically release our 523 claim, and had that been--"
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1780.838,1806.639,"They... they might be able to... I mean, I'll assume for the sake of argument that they might be able to do that, but in... in that case, the... the issue here would be resolved, on... on your theory, certainly, by the express agreement with the parties, and they didn't do that, so we've got a case in which they didn't agree on the issue expressly, and I don't see why State law, which doesn't have the issue, is a good place to look for the answer."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1806.639,1818.156,"--Well, I think... I guess my point, Your Honor, is that the question of whether they expressly agreed to it becomes a question of interpretation, and I would like to get to arguing that they did, in fact, expressly agree to it."
2002.01-1418,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.611,1829.879,"Well, didn't Brown versus Felsen suggest some discouragement to the idea of anticipatory litigation in State courts of issues that would arise in bankruptcy court?"
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1829.879,1859.851,"--I... I think Brown versus Felsen certainly expressed the view that they didn't want to encourage people to have to affirmatively determine fraud in State court when it had been, in fact, been... been... the issue of nondischargeability had been put into the bankruptcy court, but nothing in Brown versus Felsen in any way qualifies the proposition that parties can, in a State court proceeding, resolve, for example, by trial an issue of fraud that would be preclusive under collateral estoppel."
2002.01-1418,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.851,1862.739,You say it doesn't qualify the proposition.
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1864.596,1865.218,Correct.
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.218,1866.227,Suppose--
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1866.227,1872.421,"But it does, Your Honor, address it in the sense, and then Grogan confirms that collateral estoppel does apply, so that if you have a State proceeding--"
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1872.421,1874.855,--There's... there's no collateral estoppel here.
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1898.921,1924.162,"--Your Honor, under this Court's Matsushita decision, it is perfectly clear that in order to determine whether there's issue preclusion, you have to look at the State law in the State where the judgment is entered, and... and the State law, as we indicate in our brief, in North Carolina is that if you have a voluntary dismissal with prejudice under the Miller Building case, under the Barnes case, that voluntary dismissal with prejudice resolves the issues that were put in issue--"
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.162,1937.909,"--The only decision that you cite from the North Carolina supreme court says, we go down the line with what is the standard understanding of issue preclusion, actually litigated, decided, and essential to the judgment."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1937.909,1938.385,"--Your Honor, I--"
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.385,1940.902,That's what the North Carolina supreme court said.
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1940.902,1941.811,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1986.892,2001.049,"Well, that would certainly run entirely against the stream, and it would run against the Restatement of Judgments, which you cite, and that says you must manifest... yes, parties can make a stipulation finding."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2006.871,2007.53,--Right.
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2007.53,2013.475,"The court does not infer that an issue that was never litigated was, in fact, decided."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2013.475,2039.936,"I guess what... what I would like to suggest to... to the Court is that what we do have here is a settlement of a State court litigation followed by a voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that the effect of that, of those acts, including the language, because that's what the courts here... all three of these courts focus specifically on the precise language, and they concluded that that language was a waiver."
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2041.051,2047.699,"Well, if they concluded that it's a waiver of claim, and we don't have any... I presume no one has a problem with that."
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2065.427,2065.764,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.764,2067.583,--as opposed to claim preclusion--
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2067.583,2067.583,"Yes, Your Honor--"
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2067.583,2068.699,--or res judicata?
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2068.699,2075.94,"--The... the Miller Building case and the Barnes case, both of those cases involved collateral estoppel."
2002.01-1418,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.266,2092.641,"Well, was it a stipulation that... that expressly addressed the... the fact issue?"
2002.01-1418,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2092.641,2096.607,"--I don't believe you can tell from the opinion, and that's not, certainly, what they rely on."
2002.01-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.725,2117.534,"May I read you the language from McInnis, which is the North Carolina supreme court?"
2002.01-1418,3,19045,craig_goldblatt,,3458.334,3458.5,Okay.
2002.01-1418,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.077,3646.656,"It's rather unfortunate, Mr. Goldblatt, that there's nobody in the room to defend the position that I understood was taken by the question presented, namely that a novation... a novation is all you need."
2002.01-1418,3,19045,craig_goldblatt,,3652.312,3654.252,We agree that... that--
2002.01-1418,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3654.252,3657.309,--discuss the issue on... on which we took the case.
2002.01-1418,3,19045,craig_goldblatt,,3657.309,3668.659,"--Your Honor, we... we agree, as we say in our reply brief, that the principal basis of the decision below has been abandoned by respondent here, and we believe it's been abandoned because it can't be squared with this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen, which holds squarely to the contrary."
2002.01-1418,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3668.659,3669.569,Thank--
2002.01-1418,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3669.569,3676.999,"--What about the (a)(11) and (a)... the 19, the express provisions for nondischargeability?"
2002.01-1418,3,19045,craig_goldblatt,,3676.999,3685.849,"Your Honor, what Congress was doing in... in sections (a)(11)... I... I see my time has... has run out, but what Congress was doing in (a)(11) and (a)(19) was giving preclusive effect--"
2002.01-1418,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3685.849,3687.152,"Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt."
