1970.96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,3.321,Gordon against Lance.
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,8.624,13.665,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,20.778,25.592,Very well Mr. counsel.
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,25.592,30.753,This case is unique I think in the annals of jurisprudence.
1970.96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,218.823,222.947,Can the constitution of West Virginia be changed by a simple majority vote?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,222.947,225.786,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice when it's submitted."
1970.96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.963,239.777,Does this record by any chance show what the vote in fact was?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,239.777,246.869,"I am not certain Your Honor, I think the dissent of Judge Haymond does show that."
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.869,248.94,"That is back in 1962, you mean when the amendment --"
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,248.94,249.865,"1966, Your Honor."
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.865,252.522,"1966, when the amendment was submitted?"
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,252.522,253.333,Yes.
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.333,257.435,And this involves both the bond issue and a tax levy as I understand it?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,257.435,257.875,Yes Mr. Justice --
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.875,262.552,Each requiring a 60% of the vote of those voting.
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,262.552,264.079,That's right.
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,264.079,269.22,Does each of these provisions date back to 1932?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,269.22,273.926,"The tax limitation amendment dates back to 1932, that's the levy."
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.926,274.53,Tax levy.
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,274.53,275.472,"Yeah, limiting --"
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.472,275.812,In excess --
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,275.812,276.31,-- the levy rates.
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.31,280.616,-- the tax levy an access of what the local government can do by itself?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,280.616,281.676,That's right Mr. Justice Stewart and that dates --
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.676,282.702,And how about the --
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,282.702,283.772,"-- 1932, the --"
1970.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.772,284.99,And how about the bonding authority?
1970.96,0,26056,george_m_scott,,284.99,295.53,The bonding of the – our political subdivisions have always been prohibited from borrowing money except by approval of two-thirds of the persons voting on the question of borrowing money.
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1515.481,1521.164,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1628.526,1648.653,Is it -- is the sum total of your argument that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to have any elections unless it provides for result that was by the majority vote?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1648.653,1676.029,"Mr. Justice Black, I think that the line will have to be drawn somewhere and we certainly wouldn't contend that elections in very restricted areas or dealing with restricted issues or dealing with the internal procedures of a legislature or something of that kind would require a majority, but we think that when we have and --"
1970.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1676.029,1679.675,Who decides -- who decides where that line is drawn?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1679.675,1719.446,"This Honorable Court sir ultimately and we think that within the framework of those decisions, it is almost inescapable that when we are dealing with an election on an important issue on a county-wide basis, when a citizen has so little opportunity now of direct participation in an important result that their may be more reason for applying the Fourteenth amendment to this than in the election of a representative where the citizen's interest is certainly not quite as direct --"
1970.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1719.446,1726.868,"Well, there's no question in fact whether or not the Fourteenth amendment applies to West Virginia, of course it applies to West Virginia."
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1741.257,1743.041,In this particular area?
1970.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1743.041,1743.125,Yes.
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1743.125,1744.57,That's correct.
1970.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1744.57,1777.886,"And as I now understand you in connection with your second answer, you say Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to permit an election on a particular issue if it chooses to submit to the people, to permit that to be decided by less than 50% of -- by more than 50% unless this Court somehow decides that it'd be wise and better to let that election stand?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1777.886,1786.643,"Mr. Justice Black what I meant was that where the line is drawn, I think ultimately will rest with this Court."
1970.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1786.643,1788.992,"What line, what line?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1788.992,1798.74,There are certain areas where we certainly would not contend that the majority would be necessary to arrive at a decision.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.134,1823.546,You would say Constitution -- the approval of constitutional amendments would require that?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1823.546,1825.643,I think it would be wrong but I think --
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.643,1829.019,But it wouldn't be on constitutional requirement that's presented?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1829.019,1832.659,The line could be drawn whereby it would not be unconstitutional within that line.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.659,1835.476,"Who would draw the line, who would draw that line?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1835.476,1838.835,I think ultimately it would rest with this Court sir.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.835,1841.531,The line for the West Virginia Constitution?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1841.531,1847.303,It would determine whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment would apply and permit it.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.303,1862.243,What about a requirement in the West Virginia Constitution that 50% plus one a majority of all the registered voters would be required to contract bond indebtedness?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1865.188,1866.593,"No sir, I don't think so sir."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.593,1872.565,"That would require 4,500 votes in round figures here, wouldn't it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1872.565,1875.385,I believe that would be a proper restriction.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.385,1884.209,"It would be far more difficult to obtain that kind of a majority than 60% of the voters actually voting, wouldn't it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1884.209,1891.905,"Yes, it is certainly true that it is difficult to get a voter turnout under these conditions in a special election."
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.18,1916.649,"But you wouldn't -- do I understand that the law says 51% of all the eligible voters, you would think that would be something --"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1916.649,1918.262,I think that might be reasonable sir.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.262,1933.081,And the constitution is important to go on without the actual vote and claim that via majority?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1933.081,1945.247,I think it would be a grave error policy to make that type of requirement because we have had a Constitution for 98 years with practically no change and efforts to amend it.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.503,1967.611,Well how do you -- did I understand Mr. Scott to say that the legislature did by a two-thirds vote adopt constitutional amendment and then the people rejected it?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1967.611,1968.674,That is correct.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.674,1971.75,Well then how were they legislatively frustrated?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1971.75,1974.478,They weren't legislatively frustrated.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1974.478,1976.525,They just frustrated themselves?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,1976.525,2000.552,"That is correct and of course as this Court pointed out in the Lucas case against the General Assembly of Colorado, the mere fact that there has been approval by the voters of an apportionment prior does not in any ways take the proposal away from the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.722,2083.992,"The majority of the voters in the West Virginia could change the constitution of West Virginia to say that all bond issues shall be approved if they are approved by a majority, the voters actually voting?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2083.992,2086.946,Yes sir.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.946,2089.149,Is there initiative in West Virginia?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2089.149,2096.431,"No sir, we have no initiative, and it requires a two-thirds of concurring vote of both houses of the legislation."
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.431,2097.62,Which you don't challenge?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2097.62,2099.745,"Do submit, no sir."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.131,2184.349,I understood you to concede that constitutionally West Virginia could require a majority of all registered voters in response to questions of Justice White and of myself.
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2192.939,2194.615,It's substantial.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.615,2199.354,"Well, is it more than that?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2204.64,2219.385,"Well, it seems to us Mr. Chief Justice that the most the state can do is give the opportunity to vote and if it gives that opportunity it ought not dilute the diets (ph) it ought to be fair."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2241.926,2258.333,Why isn't the Federal Constitutional Provision requiring two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto “unconstitutional discrimination?”
1970.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.333,2261.776,"Well, the Fourteenth amendment doesn't apply to the federal government, does it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2261.776,2285.794,"Not to my knowledge, but philosophically I would suppose Mr. Chief Justice that, that goes back to a part of the great compromise, a part of the traditions of our form of government and in final analysis there seem to be exception to do -- to most rules somewhere along the line."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.794,2294.413,"Well, I had understood all of your argument, the main thrust of your argument was philosophical here --"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2294.413,2295.594,Yes sir.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2297.238,2304.804,"So, that the difference between the Fourteenth Amendment being binding on the States and not the Federal Government doesn't help you very much?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2304.804,2305.249,No sir.
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2307.996,2317.484,It is discriminatory in effect and philosophically discriminatory to require two-thirds veto overrides the President.
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2317.484,2317.875,Mathematically --
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.875,2319.734,"It's intentionally discriminatory, isn't it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2319.734,2321.687,"Yes sir, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2323.408,2328.053,"Well, lets' get down to something a little less theoretical."
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2333.848,2334.314,Yes sir.
1970.96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2334.314,2336.02,"The Constitution, what is that, two-thirds?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2336.02,2338.11,I believe it's fourth-fifths.
1970.96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2338.11,2338.445,Fourth-fifths?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2338.445,2340.25,Two-thirds to fourth-fifths.
1970.96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2340.25,2346.657,"Does your argument mean that, that provision of the West Virginia Constitution must fall?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2346.657,2347.086,No sir.
1970.96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2360.128,2362.104,"Even in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment, you are saying this?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2362.104,2366.281,No sir.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.281,2371.181,"The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause subsumes Equal Protection, doesn't it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2371.181,2373.253,Yes sir.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.253,2394.115,"So the -- how does the -- how can the Fifth Amendment with an Equal Protection Clause implied into it, be squared with the provisions of the main body of the constitution requiring simple majorities in some instances?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2394.115,2397.178,I do not think there is complete consistency --
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.178,2401.167,"Well, does the Fifth Amendment then modify the main provision, it has never been held?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2401.167,2403.149,It's never been held to.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.149,2406.046,So that -- you can say that it is consistent?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2406.046,2407.661,That's correct.
1970.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.661,2417.258,"So, there is no denial of Equal Protection in the constitution's equal majority requirements, I mean, just on the constitutional principle?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2417.258,2422.339,Basis of law of giving effect to all.
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.339,2441.747,"(Inaudible) assume that it takes legislature passed appropriation for schools are pretty high which would include this county and the government vetoed it forth and you couldn't muster fourth-fifths vote to override the veto, that would be it?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2441.747,2444.597,"That would be true for that particular session, yes but --"
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.597,2446.854,And you wouldn't have any complain?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2446.854,2448.616,We couldn't.
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.616,2450.43,Why not?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2452.923,2454.928,It is the same subject --
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.928,2455.796,And money.
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2455.796,2476.663,"But it comes about it seems to because of the provisions of the constitution dealing with the effect of legislative appropriation and the fact that in our checks and balance system of government, we give to the executive an opportunity to veto."
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.515,2490.723,Dealing with two provisions of your constitution?
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2490.723,2491.816,Yes sir.
1970.96,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.816,2498.078,"One is good, one is bad, is that your position?"
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2498.078,2533.08,"We think sir that both are bad but we aren't sure that the other one is subject to the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. Certainly, the Court will not be called upon at any time to go 100% by saying that majority rule shall control every aspect of life."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.042,2716.494,"I find that difficult to follow Mr. Wise and blatantly preposition that you and I seem to agree on with reference to 50%, a majority of all registered voters being required because then a man who stayed home might have a vote which would -- a non-vote which would carry more weight than a man who took the trouble to go down to the polls and vote."
1970.96,1,20301,charles_c_wise_jr,,2716.494,2725.931,"That is perfectly true, but I think we are going to have to risk that and encourage them to get out and vote their conviction."
1970.96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.786,2868.667,Thank you Mr. Wise.
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,2873.916,2875.489,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3057.739,3063.295,Did your constitution compel the legislature to submit this to the people?
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3063.295,3067.957,"No Mr. Justice Black, there is no provision for initiative that we can not compel."
1970.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3067.957,3073.981,It was an act submitted to the people by the legislature to try to find out for themselves --
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3073.981,3074.755,"Yes sir, exactly."
1970.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3074.755,3077.502,Whether there are enough people who wanted it to (Voice Overlap).
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3077.502,3087.603,"Exactly and they expressed it very clear and that was the only question submitted as Judge Haymond points in his dissent, 1966 in a majority where people voted three times."
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.603,3096.558,Was that true as with respect both to the tax levy and the bond issue provisions in 1966?
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3096.558,3100.158,"I do not think so Mr. Justice Stewart, but I could not answer with certainty."
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3100.158,3102.887,It was in fact just to one of them --
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3102.887,3107.408,I think it had to do with bond issues only if I am not mistaken.
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3107.408,3107.702,But then --
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3107.702,3110.848,At any rate it was the question of policy that they decided.
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3110.848,3117.768,And there was a proposed amendment to the state constitution submitted to popular vote in 1966?
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3117.768,3120.791,That could lead to 60% requirement as substitute to simple majority.
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.791,3124.549,"And on that question, majority vote carried --"
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3124.549,3128.043,Majority vote carried and the majority to vote was to retain a 60% rule.
1970.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3128.043,3131.926,Right now I understand.
1970.96,2,26056,george_m_scott,,3131.926,3136.29,We would urge that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia be reversed.
1970.96,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.29,3137.399,Thank you Mr. Scott.
