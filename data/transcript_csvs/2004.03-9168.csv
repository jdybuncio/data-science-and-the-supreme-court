2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.106,We will hear argument in Shepard against the United States.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,56.765,59.996,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.119,97.025,"What... what do you mean by a... just so we get our terms defined, what do you mean by a nongeneric burglary statute--"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,97.025,97.932,--In this case--
2004.03-9168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.932,99.514,--and a generic burglary statute?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,99.514,112.02,"--Well, a generic burglary statute, as... as defined in the Taylor case is one that criminalizes unlawful entry into a building or a structure with intent to commit another crime."
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.238,138.234,"Now, do you... do you agree that all the papers showing the arrest and the investigation and so forth show that this was in fact a building--"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,138.234,139.26,--No.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.26,139.919,--that was burglarized?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,139.919,140.619,I do not.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.549,143.784,Does it show it was a vehicle?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,143.784,145.42,--It doesn't show that it was a vehicle.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.42,145.97,Or a boat?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,145.97,147.45,It doesn't show that it was a boat.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.45,148.139,Or a motorcycle?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,148.139,149.274,It doesn't show that it was a motorcycle.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.274,149.835,It shows nothing?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,152.872,158.469,Those supporting documents do not play a role in the adjudication.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.469,159.702,"Well, that isn't my question."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,165.589,168.484,None of them shows that it was anything other than a building.
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.484,169.31,Thank you.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,169.31,173.574,"The police reports and the complaint applications, but the statute--"
2004.03-9168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.574,180.576,"Well, why... why are you resisting that the... that the police report gave an identified building?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,199.196,201.135,--There is no question of that.
2004.03-9168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.73,221.78,"So what... what you're saying is the conviction itself didn't show that, and so the question is whether you can look to documents that in fact showed it."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,221.78,224.282,"That's... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.282,237.762,So the rule you would have us follow does result in a... a super technicality in a sense of what... what was on the record at the time of the plea.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,237.762,244.5,"Well, actually the district court established that this was not on the record at the time of the plea."
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.318,269.676,"Suppose... suppose in the earlier conviction, the police report is in the court."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,284.405,298.316,"Well, that calls into question what kinds of documents can be examined in terms of making a... a determination as to whether this offense was categorically a crime of violence, that is, that it was generic burglary."
2004.03-9168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.25,345.976,"But if the defendant at the plea colloquy had said, yes, I entered X building or even in the plea bargain had said that, even though the charge just read the boiler plate, the whole statute, buildings, vessels, et cetera, if he had admitted it either in the plea colloquy or in the plea bargain, wouldn't that be enough?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,345.976,365.346,"If we had a contemporaneous record of the adjudication of this conviction that showed an actual admission to breaking into a building, I believe that that would satisfy a sort of modified Taylor categorical approach."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,365.346,367.077,I... I don't understand your reading of Taylor.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,469.462,470.347,"Well, the--"
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,470.347,471.848,Why is everyone so mixed up?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,472.986,490.597,"--The example that's given, the charging document and jury instructions... let's suppose that instead of... of guilty pleas, Mr. Shepard was tried and he was tried on this nongeneric, boiler plate complaint, and there were no jury instructions available."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.597,492.263,What's the problem?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,533.768,552.113,"The district court did actually entertain this issue, Justice Breyer, and what they... what the district court found was there wasn't an opportunity, there wasn't a reason for Mr. Shepard to contest building or any other element of this offense."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.113,552.703,"No, of course, there wasn't."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,584.415,586.884,"Well, and it also isn't in fact."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,588.688,589.901,What do you mean it isn't right in fact?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,590.114,590.381,--Is it in law--
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,590.381,590.731,Yes.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,590.731,593.015,--or in fact that we are trying to make this determination?
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.015,596.158,We look to facts about what the prior convictions were about.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,602.82,605.86,Taylor said you don't look at facts--
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.86,607.447,I understand your reading of it.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,609.657,614.668,--Because your reading of it requires a look at the underlying conduct.
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.097,625.856,All right.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,677.86,685.709,"In this case it's the statute that was violated, but you are correct, Justice Souter--"
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,685.709,686.347,"Well, I don't have a position."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,686.856,687.505,--that... no.
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.7,728.78,"--Well, aren't we asking that question in... in any case?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,774.054,783.649,"Well, because it's based on an examination of the underlying conduct, which is forbidden by the Taylor decision--"
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,783.649,785.16,"Well, maybe, maybe not."
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,789.93,790.716,Suppose--
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.716,796.018,Do you join the amici in saying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,796.018,796.953,"--No, I do not."
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.953,797.174,No.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,797.174,798.35,I do not join--
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.35,798.806,--But suppose--
2004.03-9168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.806,799.036,All right.
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,799.528,800.062,--Taylor were not on the books.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,811.332,812.729,--The sense it makes is this.
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.417,880.739,"But... but why can you look at what's in the plea colloquy that's in the record, but you cannot look at a document that the judge referred to, if that document isn't there?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,884.705,889.271,"Well, there is no evidence in this case that the judge referred to a police report."
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.271,889.491,No.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,902.319,920.317,"If you can look at the colloquy and the judge, without incorporating it, has the defendant explicitly admit the facts that constitute the elements of generic burglary, it is our position that that... that conviction could be used to enhance."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,921.969,922.941,Let me try the same question.
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,922.941,933.166,But... but why can't you go one step further and refer to the document that was not in the record but that the judge mentioned in his... in his findings at the first sentencing?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,935.804,957.275,"--I agree that whether or not that document is in the record, if there is an explicit finding or an admission by the court that enters the judgment, that the defendant broke and entered a building, that that conviction should be able to qualify as a predicate under the Armed Career Criminal Act."
2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.346,972.685,May I ask you a question?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,987.316,988.653,Certainly not under Taylor.
2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.995,1000.25,So your argument is that this is comparable to using the transcript of the trial.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1000.25,1013.474,"This is... it... well, I don't think it's comparable because the district court finding was that the documents that the Government relies on were not involved in the adjudication at all."
2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.275,1015.632,So this is even farther removed.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1015.632,1021.922,"--This is even farther removed than a plea colloquy, farther removed than a trial transcript looking into the evidence--"
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1021.922,1023.299,But that's what I don't understand.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1098.295,1101.694,"--If, for example."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.133,1101.694,"If, for example."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1112.257,1116.668,And I... I do agree that that's one of the questions presented by this case.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.668,1120.893,"Yes, but do you want add the for example or do you want to take it just categorically?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1120.893,1124.866,"Well, I do believe that the best reading is the categorical reading."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.866,1125.329,Yes.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1125.329,1126.635,But I'm willing to accept for example--
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.635,1127.234,Okay.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1128.861,1129.638,--for purposes of argument.
2004.03-9168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.638,1130.997,--let us look to and what kinds of things not?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1135.43,1140.778,And all Taylor and the Armed Career Criminal Act are interested in is what was he convicted of.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.778,1141.38,"--No, no, no."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1148.947,1149.597,True.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.597,1150.496,"So, fine."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1155.847,1163.074,You can look to the charging document and the statute to see what he was charged with.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.074,1163.408,All right.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1178.157,1180.419,Not to determine what he was charged with.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.567,1226.157,And what's the difference between that and a police report that makes it quite clear that in the circumstances there was no possibility of a boat or a car being involved?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1228.808,1234.019,--The police report does not show you what the results of the adjudication was.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.883,1235.075,No.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1236.929,1237.621,--The elements.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.621,1238.203,--is the check mark.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1277.463,1282.697,"Well, I suggest that it doesn't tell you anything about what's actually been adjudicated."
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.027,1325.355,"I mean, but that's always true."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1350.542,1355.694,Which brings me to Henderson against Morgan.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.674,1373.226,I... I don't... good.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1387.614,1388.508,It does.
2004.03-9168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.508,1388.903,All right.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1391.184,1395.338,I'm talking about the... the 2 percent that are nongeneric burglary.
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.684,1430.99,Why can't you make the determination?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1488.195,1494.722,"That... that is part of the argument, and I... I think that we're just using different terms here."
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.949,1503.71,"I... I'll accept that, yes."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1503.71,1504.175,Okay.
2004.03-9168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1514.14,1517.788,"But you... you still haven't given a reason, other than the one Justice Souter accepts."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1545.92,1555.081,"Well, the theory that I'm proposing is... is I believe the theory that's already been adopted by this Court, which is the... the one described in Taylor."
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.365,1566.186,But why is a categorical determination important?
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1571.039,1571.504,It's--
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.504,1572.264,--a reliability concern.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1574.224,1578.088,--It is reliable and it's also not fact-based.
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1579.585,1589.785,"No, but is... is your point that once you get beyond the documents that you admit we can look at, there is a higher... an... an unacceptably high risk of unreliability?"
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1590.713,1596.675,"--That is one of my arguments, Justice Souter, and the... and there's something that goes hand in glove with that and did in this case."
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.704,1608.503,"Well, but that... that doesn't necessarily follow."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1608.503,1608.799,--assignment--
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.799,1612.719,But that doesn't necessarily follow from... from looking at a police report.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1630.389,1632.615,"--Well, it--"
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1632.615,1639.726,There's no... I guess all I'm saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the Government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts.
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1641.485,1644.945,--What shifts is the risk of being wrong.
2004.03-9168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.19,1661.896,"Yes, but the Government--"
2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.896,1663.317,"Ms. Thompson, you know your white light is on."
2004.03-9168,0,35171,linda_j_thompson,,1665.742,1665.933,--I would.
2004.03-9168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.608,1675.471,Mr. Elwood.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1675.471,1677.742,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.769,1711.616,May I ask this question?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1720.878,1728.007,"--I think in a case where the police report was ambiguous about what it is that the person broke into, I think that you could not base the enhancement on that."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.527,1737.489,But why... why couldn't you use it in the other case?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1742.628,1744.355,--I think you might be able to--
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.355,1750.355,"And you'd start out with the premise that 90 percent of these cases are really houses anyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the Government?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1750.355,1756.285,--I... I think that you could talk about introducing extrinsic evidence of... of that sort.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.15,1765.19,"So the... the question in this case is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence, isn't it?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1765.19,1770.877,--I don't think so in this case because the police report is in... in a police file itself.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.877,1776.189,"Well, suppose that it was an assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to decide whether it was violent or not, and the police report was somewhat ambiguous."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1779.105,1788.977,"No, and I don't think you could for an additional reason, which is that I don't think assault and battery is necessarily a... is a necessary element of the... of... of... I'm sorry."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.977,1792.652,There's a distinction between violent assaults and--
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1792.652,1793.651,"Right, violent and nonviolent."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.651,1794.036,--nonviolent assaults.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1794.036,1794.5,Exactly right.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.5,1798.229,"And you might want to find out which one it was and... and as here, it seems pretty easy."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1806.838,1826.707,"The only rule we are advocating is that when we are talking about a necessary element of the offense that can be satisfied in different ways, that you can look to the police report to indicate which way it was met in this case if the rest of the file, the State court file, indicates that the police report was the... provided the factual basis or provided the basis for the conviction."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.938,1834.318,"Well, you say it provided the basis for the conviction."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1837.117,1839.7,--We believe that the record indicates that it was.
2004.03-9168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.177,1879.197,I thought Judge Gertner said she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police report.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1895.411,1902.963,"To begin with, Judge Gertner looked only to... she didn't draw any inference based on the document recording the guilty plea and what happened."
2004.03-9168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1937.697,1938.814,But we don't have any colloquy.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1945.618,1953.551,"But we do know that under Massachusetts State law, that there... before a court can accept a guilty plea, there has to be a factual basis in the record."
2004.03-9168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.31,1981.214,"So if the defendant says, yes, I plead guilty to this crime and the crime is described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's... if that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, I did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than violate the statute."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1981.214,1994.307,"The requirement... the factual basis requirement requires a statement of the facts, not a statement of the legal conclusion, and simply reading the charging document as a legal conclusion about what it... about a boat, building, et cetera was broken into."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.062,2019.621,"But couldn't the judge in that colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building, a car, or a boat?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2022.96,2032.922,"I don't... I don't think it would have satisfied the factual basis requirement in that there has to be a narrative description of what the defendant did, like he showed up at that day and he broke into 258 Norwell Street."
2004.03-9168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2040.855,2044.213,"Now, there's no record here of the colloquy at the plea?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2044.893,2045.068,--No.
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.989,2058.411,But your test is whether or not there's reliable record evidence?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2060.248,2068.893,"Yes, whether there's reliable record evidence that is reliable in describing what the offense was that was the subject of the plea colloquy."
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.679,2090.228,Does it... does the plea refer to the police report?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2090.228,2091.29,"No, it does not."
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.718,2106.998,Where do you draw the line?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2120.189,2122.294,I think that--
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2122.294,2125.236,Can we still go find the police report and then where do we stop?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2125.236,2147.731,"--I think that if there's no reference to the police report and if the police report is not in the State court file, which it was in this case... the court indicated it was in the State court file... I... I think that you would probably have to have a stronger showing in order to say, well, he pleaded guilty to the police report such as a... a reference to the police report or more of an indication on the guilty plea form, a notation of... of what was entered or--"
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.731,2148.14,"Well, you mentioned--"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2148.14,2152.571,--something that unambiguously indicated the police report provided the factual basis for the plea.
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2152.571,2153.85,--You... you mentioned the State file.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2168.637,2190.056,"The... if... I... I think that there has to be both an... that the police report is unambiguous and that there is reason to believe or that it is more likely than not that the police report provided the factual basis for the plea, and if it's... if there's no reference to it in so many words, I think the same could be said this... that the same could be said here in this case."
2004.03-9168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.317,2201.741,So what is your... what rule would you have here?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2276.788,2292.744,"I think our argument... or the... the proposition that we are arguing for today is that when the documents and the State court file indicate that the defendant was arrested for only burglary of a building and there's no question that it wasn't a ship or a vehicle, that it will support the ACCA--"
2004.03-9168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.744,2294.468,"Yes, but we're still going to have to write something."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2294.468,2294.864,--Correct.
2004.03-9168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.151,2296.049,And what I want to know is what's your rule.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2296.049,2296.35,--Right.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.019,2308.825,May I--
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.825,2314.668,So... so we... are we going to decide... decide a lot of probate cases about incorporation by reference in wills and stuff?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2314.668,2316.244,I... I think--
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.244,2317.304,I don't know what we're supposed to do.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2317.304,2326.115,"--I think that in this case it just... I don't think the Court really has to get to the outer reaches of this because in many of these cases, it's overwhelming--"
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.115,2335.33,"--But if we don't get to the outer reaches, the next case I suppose will involve a... an application for a search warrant or an arrest warrant which describes facts and pretty well tells you what really happened."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2336.211,2336.601,--No.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.039,2349.868,"Well, the police report wasn't made on that date."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2352.009,2363.713,"--The police report was prepared earlier, but when the crime... when they wrote down guilty, the offense he was guilty of is breaking into a certain address at a certain day, belonging to a certain victim, and involving the same arresting officer."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.409,2369.59,"But if it's that... if it's that explicit, I don't think you need the police report."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2369.59,2373.835,"--Well, perhaps because you can refer to the police report."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.835,2379.315,It seems to me we're dealing with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently ambiguous that you have to look to something else.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2394.429,2400.133,I think that you really only have to look at... the... the fact that these are present in the court's files and the fact that--
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.133,2402.062,I thought the police reports were not present in the court--
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2402.062,2402.888,--They are present in the court's files.
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2407.278,2409.972,"Well, the... the warrant affidavit is going to be present in the files."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2414.053,2422.318,"--I think, though, that there's... there would be no particular reason to believe that the warrant application had been... had served as the basis for the guilty plea."
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2423.852,2424.108,Why... why not?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2438.518,2451.583,"--If... I... I think that if the documents recording the guilty plea indicate that the... that the crime described is the crime described in the warrant application, you probably could look at that if... to determine if it was a boat or a building or--"
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.583,2464.661,"Well, let's say the warrant application says, you know, we're looking for a stolen radio and the charge does indicate that he was... that... that the... that the property taken in the burglary was a... was... was a radio."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2484.243,2485.621,--Perhaps.
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2496.387,2500.554,"Well, it may be done in advance by... you know, by... by a couple of hours from the... the police going in--"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2500.554,2500.723,--Right.
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2505.242,2527.264,"--What... what about the... the police officer... what... what if we don't have a document of any sort but the... the State calls the police officer who, in fact, made the application for the... the issuance of the complaint and he says, when I appeared to ask for the issuance of the complaint, I testified to, I swore to the following facts?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2537.913,2545.164,"I think that under a sort of a... theoretically that's a... that is a theoretical possibility, Justice Souter."
2004.03-9168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2558.396,2558.636,They have notes.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2576.71,2588.285,"--It's... it's both contemporaneity, if I've said that correctly, but I think also a... a reason to infer that it provided the basis for the plea... for the plea colloquy, which it is in this case because--"
2004.03-9168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2588.285,2594.914,"Well, I guess you would be content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the plea colloquy in court."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2594.914,2595.656,--That's correct.
2004.03-9168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2596.544,2607.531,"And you would take... you would make the assumption, apparently, that on that occasion the elements, the factual basis for the plea would have been disclosed."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2610.68,2617.133,"--It has been destroyed, but Massachusetts State law requires that there be a factual basis before the court can accept a guilty plea."
2004.03-9168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2622.422,2625.733,You can just presume that the proceeding was regular and it was disclosed.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2639.874,2640.141,"No, there isn't."
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2645.273,2657.179,So you want us to write the opinion that we can presume that what's in the State investigative files and records was likely before the trial court?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2657.985,2658.194,I don't think it--
2004.03-9168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2658.194,2659.226,--I don't know what I'm supposed to write.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2659.226,2683.634,"--That when the... basically when the police report is unambiguous and when the documents in the State court file indicate that the basis for the guilty plea was the crime described in the police report, that you can infer that the factual basis for the plea, which is required under Massachusetts law, was in fact the breaking into a building as opposed to a ship or a vehicle and so forth."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.634,2685.238,"--Mr. Elwood, can I tell you what's troubling me about that?"
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2720.455,2729.294,"I think to me it's not 100 percent clear whether when Taylor referred to the jury instructions and the charging documents, that that was exhaustive of the jury trial conflict."
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.294,2730.07,It's a for example thing.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2730.07,2730.251,Right.
2004.03-9168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.543,2761.336,The thing I'm just questioning is whether this rule that you... you're advocating is really more administrable than one that just says it seems crazy in this particular case.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2769.766,2771.568,I think that it has proven administrable.
2004.03-9168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2780.214,2782.735,How should we interpret Taylor?
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2790.424,2799.264,"--I think it's definitely should be interpreted to include guilty pleas because taking Taylor literally, I mean, they only discussed jury trials."
2004.03-9168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.047,2832.651,"Well, then... but reading it that way, which is arguable, this case, but reading it that way, you'd say you can look... what we're interested in is not what happened."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2862.623,2864.465,--I... I think that is a sensible rule.
2004.03-9168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.596,2868.074,So you'd say there's... you can look to what Justice Stevens says.
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2881.64,2883.037,--I... I think that would be a sensible rule.
2004.03-9168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.34,2917.461,"Mr. Elwood, we had a case last term involving a search warrant, Groh against Ramirez, and it... it was very clear that the application for the warrant identified specifically what the police were to search for, but the warrant itself didn't."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,2950.9,2962.941,"As I recall Groh, that case specifically turned on the fact that the face of the Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant describe, not that the supporting documents describe, the place to be searched and the items to be seized."
2004.03-9168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2971.224,3007.819,"Well, Taylor... Taylor doesn't quite have this full for example because there's another paragraph following the for example paragraph which says we hold an offense constitutes burglary for purposes of 924(e) if either the statutory definition corresponds to generic burglary, which it doesn't here, or the charging paper, which it doesn't here, and jury instructions, which the judge tells the jury you must find this in order to convict."
2004.03-9168,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,3024.758,3065.78,"--I think, though, that in the context that... that is, if you're going to include guilty pleas at all for these sort of straddle offenses that... that some of the conduct is generic burglary and some isn't, that if Taylor is accepted on face value, where it isn't an example, then it... it basically would mean that, sub silentio, the... the Court had held that guilty pleas could not be used at all for this sort of inquiry under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which I think would be extraordinarily or... or it would definitely limit at least the utility of the ACCA as an act punishing recidivism because the vast majority of convictions are obtained through criminal--"
