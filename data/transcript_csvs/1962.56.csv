1962.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.092,"Number 56, Federal Trade Commission, petitioner, versus Sun Oil Company."
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,9.64,16.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1962.56,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.183,555.94,This is a -- this is a peculiar kind of a business.
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,582.956,584.585,"Yes, this is different."
1962.56,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.852,592.161,"I don't know that it's unique but it's certainly quite different, quite different from the ordinary jewelry store or dry good store or department store."
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,592.161,633.862,"Well, I could perhaps give you the example of a shirt store specializing in handling a particular brand of shirts and very often it carries the name of the manufacturer of the shirts, Arrow Shirt Store, Manhattan Shirt Store, and it is its primary article of commerce just the retail gas -- service station sells other things besides gasoline and it sells accessories, tires, batteries, and well, it carries the name of the supplier of gasoline on the station. It is not under the Clayton Act required to carry all of the products of the station -- of the oil company."
1962.56,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.862,639.555,"But those -- that is the fact, that those are the facts of life generally, they do carry the products of only one manufacturer, do they not?"
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,639.555,653.583,"Yes, they do and we say, our position is that out of that -- the extent to which that station is tied to a particular manufacturer is the result of the choice of the manufacturer basically."
1962.56,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.542,721.222,"Of course -- I suppose a fortiori, it's quite clear that had this price reduction not been granted, McLean would've gone out of business very quickly?"
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,721.222,726.252,"Well, there is a conclusion to this effect."
1962.56,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,727.169,730.542,Small businessmen who have just been destroyed very quickly.
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,730.542,770.058,"Well, there were six price cuts in -- with respect to McLean that were deep over a period of six months in the price war which ensued when Sun gave a price cut to McLean which he did not give to its other dealers, there was a period of more than six weeks when all of the dealers of the area, including the dealers for some six or eight other majors who were within a two-and-a-half mile or two -- within a radius of two or three blocks, were competing as substantial disadvantage to McLean."
1962.56,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,917.78,934.589,"Mr. Hummel, I think the records says [Inaudible] --"
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,934.589,941.59,An argument is made that the Commission did have that understanding and I don't propose to dispute it here today.
1962.56,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,942.619,944.904,[Inaudible]
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,944.904,951.49,"Yes they were and if they had -- if they were taking that position today, I would not be here defending it."
1962.56,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,951.49,957.02,[Inaudible]
1962.56,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,957.02,974.345,"Of course, this is -- this I might say that the Commission was or congressional committees felt that the statute was being not properly and -- not enforced at all during the period and I may say it was not too long a period."
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3018.749,3023.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.56,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3149.367,3158.515,Had there been any administrative practice by the Commission prior to this case what was its position in other cases?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3158.515,3159.523,Yes.
1962.56,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3222.576,3226.707,What was the situation before 1954?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3226.707,3243.312,"Well before 1954, the statute was in language when it was construed definitively, was in a language different than the language which is involved now and which was involved in 1954."
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3346.609,3351.546,You mean Super Test is the supplier and there's no evidence in the record as to who that was.
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3351.546,3353.474,"Oh, there is no evidence as to who Super Test was."
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3353.474,3356.28,But you mean -- you mean Super Test the supplier rather than Super Test --
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3356.28,3364.331,Or the Super Test Company as a chain retailer having enough gasoline to supply 65 stations.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3398.504,3400.705,That clearly is within the literal words of the statute.
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3400.705,3403.58,That is clearly within the literal words of the statute.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3458.788,3460.847,"Well, that's the question before it sued."
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3460.847,3462.248,That is the essential question.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3462.248,3462.866,"It's the only question, isn't it?"
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3462.866,3463.637,It's the only question.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3463.637,3465.395,Availability of the -- this proviso as a defense in this case.
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3465.395,3466.728,Yes.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3876.324,3877.888,Is that case in your brief?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3877.888,3881.317,That case is in our brief Your Honor.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3883.706,3884.902,Of the Trade Commission.
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3884.902,3885.79,It is the Trade Commission --
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3885.79,3888.272,[Inaudible]
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3888.272,3892.084,There was nothing but the docket number.
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3892.084,3892.987,What was the name of it?
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3892.987,3893.16,American Oil Company.
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3893.16,3896.023,American Oil Company.
1962.56,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3903.328,3906.604,Is that the one where Commissioner Elman dissented?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3906.604,3924.411,"That is it and in his dissent, he calls attention to the dilemma which a marketer confronts and since it is only the Commission decision, may I read an excerpt from his dissent which states the argument most forcibly?"
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3924.411,3925.853,Is that on your brief?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3925.853,3926.28,Yes.
1962.56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3926.28,3927.153,Page 26.

1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,3930.578,3939.286,"If American had chosen to give equally large discounts to its Marietta dealers, where could it have safely stopped."
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4086.578,4090.485,What do you mean by “gave assistance”?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4090.485,4091.706,Gave assistance?
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4091.706,4094.13,"You said gave assistance, you mean cut prices?"
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4094.13,4101.87,"Cut prices in one form or another, sometimes by lowering the tank wagon, sometimes without lowering the tank wagon by making a (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4101.87,4102.884,"In other words, they gave lower prices."
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4102.884,4105.883,Gave lower prices.
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4319.177,4320.274,In what area?
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4320.274,4321.726,In Jacksonville.
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4321.726,4323.401,"You mean by that, you cut the prices."
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4323.401,4324.409,"We cut the prices, yes."
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4324.409,4325.397,I can understand that (Voice Overlap) --
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4325.397,4327.321,"Yes, we cut prices, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4327.321,4328.745,It may not be euphemistic [Inaudible].
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4328.745,4328.924,Yes.
1962.56,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4328.924,4331.856,-- I understand you.
1962.56,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4331.856,4346.336,"Would your position be any different here if Super Test was not a chain of stations, it's just a small independent station?"
1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4346.336,4365.747,It would not be any different Mr. Chief Justice if we look to the fundamental basic premise of our position which is that a gasoline supplier of grand profit is in competition for the business of motorists.

1962.56,1,34396,leonard_j_emmerglick,,4767.846,4772.795,"Well, perhaps we should have helped him shortly than waiting for four months, Your Honor."
1962.56,2,39534,robert_b_hummel,,4896.861,4901.89,May it please the Court.
1962.56,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4960.012,4963.545,"Is that -- was this -- is this good or bad from your point of view, I --"

1962.56,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4964.417,4968.369,Should Sun have cut -- done these four months earlier from your point of view?
1962.56,2,39534,robert_b_hummel,,4968.369,4977.127,"This, if Your Honor please, refutes the notion that McLean was being oppressed by Super Test."
