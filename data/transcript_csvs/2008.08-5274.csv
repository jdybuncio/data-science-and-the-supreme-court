2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,8.57,9.986,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.874,52.48,"Mr. Forster, there are three levels under this: Possession, brandishing, and if the gun is discharged."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,59.836,62.121,"We -- we do not dispute that, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,65.489,72.393,So we're talking about a three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun is discharged?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,72.393,75.262,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly right."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,99.461,104.364,I think one of the stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive voice.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,115.089,119.641,"Your Honor, I think that it's a transitive verb the way it's used."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,136.086,139.705,So you think it's different -- I don't remember the grammar too well.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,146.024,156.516,"--I'm not sure it would make a difference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't think there's any -- I think that by definition the Court would have to ask itself who discharged the weapon."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,161.95,162.584,"Well, I'm not sure that's right."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,178.079,189.303,"--Your Honor, I don't believe the statute would, because the individual who would be charged with it would not himself had ""during"" or ""and in relation to"" the underlying crime of violence."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.303,193.338,"But it doesn't say -- it says, ""if the gun is discharged""."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,202.111,206.746,"Yes, Your Honor, I think under the government's theory that would be true."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.598,209.967,Excuse me.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,223.524,226.642,"--No, Justice Scalia, not under our reading."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.142,228.178,"No, you say under the government's it would?"
2008.08-5274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.161,234.998,You have to use or carry the firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.998,238.367,But it's the police officer who snatches the gun.
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.367,239.569,"Ah, that's different, yes."
2008.08-5274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.569,240.169,That's different.
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.169,247.406,"So it is using the robber's gun, but by the police officer who is apprehending him."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,262.15,263.184,"--That's true, ma'am."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.184,269.005,And I guess it's also the government's view -- and this is even weirder -- that it doesn't matter who brandishes the gun.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,282.413,292.335,"Your Honor, I don't believe that the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving the gun around -- I don't think that would meet the definition of 924 defines it."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.335,297.406,So it has a very specific -- what are the words that define what is brandishing?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,297.406,302.393,"Justice Ginsburg, ""brandish"" is defined under the statute a couple of different ways."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.688,328.377,I -- I didn't think the government or anybody was reading the definition of brandishing to include a police officer.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,328.377,334.364,"The way the government's brief -- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't know that the government goes that far."
2008.08-5274,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.364,342.951,"Well, they've run into the problem, which is also a different problem for you, and that is the brandishing must be for the purposes of -- for the purpose of intimidating."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.951,343.552,Right.
2008.08-5274,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.552,348.838,So that's probably going to eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the felon's gun.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,381.326,391.883,"Your Honor, I would disagree with that simply for this reason: This Court's case law is clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens rea element, they must affirmatively do so."
2008.08-5274,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,401.573,402.341,Why is it improper?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,407.627,417.101,"Your Honor, I think that that would be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that exists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the requirement--"
2008.08-5274,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,417.101,429.575,"We have -- we have lots of cases in which it makes sense to disregard that presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I mean, accomplice liability being an example."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,480.008,485.995,"--Your Honor, I don't think this statute is driven by consequence."
2008.08-5274,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,488.78,489.164,Why?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,489.164,495.401,--Because the words that the statute uses are directly focused to the -- to the conduct of the defendant:
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.388,501.938,"Well, this is conduct."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,520.849,535.693,"Your Honor, certainly under the statute the court had far more authority than the 10 years it imposed, and I think Congress is clear that they -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences in such a case."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,539.847,543.715,Your -- your argument would give rise to very serious problems of proof.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,580.674,584.809,"Your Honor, obviously -- I mean, the risk certainly does go up."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,591.995,593.314,"That's not my question, really."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,608.324,621.882,"--Your Honor, I don't believe a jury would be -- would make that decision, because under this Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the judge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these claims, and it would be--"
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.882,622.465,Excuse me?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,624.048,631.738,"--Under this Court's authority in Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not elements of the offense that must be indicted and proved to a jury."
2008.08-5274,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,638.492,645.379,"Doesn't that undermine your argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has to apply, since this is just a sentencing element?"
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,645.379,647.248,"Your Honor, I don't believe so."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,657.853,668.161,Isn't it part of the background here that it was proposed at the time these enhancements came into the law.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,678.85,681.402,"I didn't hear the -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.402,708.119,"I thought that part of the legislative history was that there were proposals -- I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between ""possess"" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent element -- ""brandishing"", very clear, for purposes of intimidation -- then ""discharge"" has no -- it's just that the gun is discharged."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,721.046,729.366,"Your Honor, there were various drafts in the House and the Senate that -- that specifically provided the intent requirement."
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.77,764.686,Why?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,784.849,785.783,We don't--
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.783,789.301,And you don't get anywhere -- I just can't get anywhere with the language.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,832.93,833.797,--Your Honor--
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.797,839.568,"Would you say, look, this is why you win?"
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,839.568,848.34,"--Your Honor, in the committee reports and so forth, I think it's pretty clear that they did not intend an unintentional or an accidental discharge to be covered."
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.34,850.126,Why -- why do you think that?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,883.513,889.684,"Your Honor, the requirement -- we think that the discharge, again, must be during and in relation to."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.269,894.405,Which -- it's during the bank robbery.
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.405,901.559,"It's in relation to the -- I mean, you know, in a sense it is, and in a sense it isn't; same problem."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,901.559,909.514,--I don't think this case -- this Court's case law would support a finding that an accidental use would have been in relation to.
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.449,913.949,"Well, there's accidents and accidents."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,936.898,941.136,I think that the evidence would suggest that he was reckless--
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.136,942.419,You accept that--
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,942.419,943.652,--but I don't believe that it was knowing.
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,945.504,947.705,--You say reckless is not enough; it has to be knowing.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,968.553,970.488,"--Absolutely, there was."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.963,983.629,Why?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1053.29,1064.662,"Justice Scalia, sir, we believe that the proper -- that the better reading would be some connection between those two, between the discharge and the underlying -- the during and relation to."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.662,1065.264,Why is that?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1082.457,1091.729,"Your Honor, if that were the -- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead to what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far as the results go."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.804,1161.057,How would -- how would a discharge not be during and in relation to?
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1164.742,1168.979,Any discharge any other time.
2008.08-5274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1168.979,1171.615,He sees a duck fly by the window and he's a hunter.
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.615,1172.365,But that -- excuse me.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1180.787,1184.073,That's the connection that we believe exists.
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.073,1185.606,And that's the only connection that's necessary.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1199.999,1203.217,"Your Honor, I don't think that's the -- the best way to read it."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.688,1217.377,"The -- the ""use or carry"" certainly has to be in relation -- during and in relation to, but that's step one."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1244.544,1255.252,"And -- and I would agree with that, and then when you take this Court's authority in Smith to say that that type use during and in relation to cannot be accidental."
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.499,1277.868,Let me ask you a question about that.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1294.31,1297.596,"I don't know that I would use the word ""enhancement"", Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.048,1300.614,Right.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1300.614,1307.201,"--carries with it ""uses"" as in this case as well as later on in the statute ""possesses""."
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.484,1313.605,But merely possessing is enough to get the first enhancement of five years.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1313.605,1315.64,If it is in furtherance--
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.64,1316.757,Or relation to.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1316.757,1317.39,--If it's--
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.39,1321.794,"The ""uses or carries"" doesn't -- doesn't necessarily apply to the possession."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1321.794,1326.615,"--The -- I believe, under the reading of the statute, Your Honor, they're separate."
2008.08-5274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.65,1330.2,Right.
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1330.2,1331.483,"--in furtherance of, but he wasn't."
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.137,1353.08,"Why do we have to find that the phrase ""if a firearm is brandished"" and the later phrase ""if a firearm is discharged"" require intentional brandishing and intentional discharging?"
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1374.179,1374.762,Well--
2008.08-5274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.762,1379.231,"The definition of brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put another person in fear."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1379.231,1386.753,"--Your Honor, I think that you would then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first of all, I think it's the best reading of the statute."
2008.08-5274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.354,1477.376,"Why -- you say that this background principle, that there has to be a state of mind element -- and we can accept that that's a general principle."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1515.418,1534.213,"--Your Honor, if -- I believe such an interpretation would basically mean that that silence would be interpreted as a strict liability, that silence with regards to the specific intent requirement would mean the Congress meant that no intent was necessary."
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.04,1575.757,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-5274,0,41286,scott_j_forster,,1575.757,1576.59,Thank you.
2008.08-5274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.59,1581.526,Ms. Maynard.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1581.526,1591.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its terms, the sentencing factor in section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no mens rea requirement."
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.524,1607.344,Does it -- does it require that the discharge be during and in relation to the crime?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1626.471,1632.559,As long as the discharge occurs while the 924(c) offense is going on--
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.559,1633.209,Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1633.209,1635.661,"--yes, Justice Scalia, it would -- it would apply."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1644.017,1653.723,"What about the police come in and say, ""Drop it""; he says, ""Oh, my robbery's over""; he drops it, and it goes off?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1653.723,1664.846,"That case might present a question about whether or not, once he drops it in compliance with a lawful order to do so, he is still committing the section 924(c) offense."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.302,1674.619,All right.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1686.86,1706.589,"--In our -- under our theory, the -- there must be a temporal connection between the offense that -- for which the defendant is being sentenced, which is a section 924(c) offense, the using or carrying the firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery in your hypothetical or possessing it in furtherance of the bank robbery in your hypothetical."
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.561,1748.916,"Do you think that -- regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do you think that he has to discharge it or that he has to brandish it?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1754.654,1766.878,"Two -- at least two points about that, Your Honor: The passive voice makes clear that Congress cared about the fact of a discharge, that Congress was indifferent as to who discharged the weapon."
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.708,1788.827,Grabs it out of his hand and brandishes it.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1788.827,1795.147,"--and brandishes it in order to intimidate the victims in the bank, then, yes, both of them would be subject to the brand -- to the brandishing enhancement."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.978,1825.0,So even a police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber and 10 minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes off.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1825.0,1832.939,"Again, I think that would present questions about whether or not the section 924(c) offense was still continuing, if the law enforcement officer has the weapon."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.939,1833.606,"Well, assuming it is."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1848.549,1856.222,"If the section 924(c) offense is -- is -- is ongoing and if the firearm is discharged, the mandatory minimum sentence applies."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1866.593,1872.647,"Well, there probably aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes off, either."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1873.264,1874.599,--That's true.
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.911,1894.478,I interrupted your answer.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1894.478,1909.087,"About the third -- if one is concerned about the actions of third parties who are not confederates in any way taking the weapon -- and we do believe it does under the statute's language need to be the firearm that is the basis of the section 924(c) offense, and not someone else's firearm."
2008.08-5274,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.777,1955.199,It would be the same -- you would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the gun from the robber and it went off?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1955.199,1965.257,"If the teller grabs the gun from the -- from the robber and it discharges, as long as the section 924(c) offense is continuing, then the firearm is discharged."
2008.08-5274,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1965.824,1971.494,But your alternate position would apply to the teller as well as the police officer?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1971.494,1977.815,--One could reasonably conclude that if the teller discharges it isn't a fact in the manner in which the defendant committed the offense.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.074,1994.657,There is another--
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.657,1997.126,"We don't really have to decide all this stuff, do we?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2002.363,2007.132,"--There is no question here, Your Honor, but that it was the robber that discharged the weapon."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.738,2017.023,"But it's also uncontested it was accidental, I think."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2017.023,2019.992,We have not challenged that it was accidental.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.258,2035.648,"What do you say to your opponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not -- but that there's sort of a background rule that generally we assume, when Congress prohibits conduct, it means intentional conduct; and normally if they don't mean that, they make it rather clear in the statute."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2039.219,2042.171,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens, with respect to sentencing factors."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.789,2050.675,What's the difference between a sentencing factor that adds five years to a sentence and an element of the crime?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2058.764,2066.87,"--Well, in Harris, which was -- in which this Court was interpreting these very sentencing factors here, the Court note -- noted that--"
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.87,2068.37,Let me -- let me rephrase the question.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2068.37,2068.822,--Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.822,2073.357,"If it were an element of the crime, would you then agree with his background rule?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2073.357,2076.975,"No, Your Honor, because if it were an element--"
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.975,2080.462,Then the fact that the sentencing factor is an element really isn't significant.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2080.462,2088.949,"--I think it might be a harder case for us if it were an element of the crime, but it wouldn't be an element that would be necessary."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.949,2090.568,But why would it be a harder case for you?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2090.568,2092.77,Why would it be a harder case for us?
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.226,2107.946,"But in that situation, would there be a background rule that we normally think Congress intends to punish intentional conduct?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2107.946,2115.183,--I think there is a background rule with respect to the definition of criminal offenses that Congress intends some mens rea.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.183,2120.003,So you really then are relying on the difference between an element of the crime and a sentencing factor?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2120.003,2131.561,"Not -- no, Your Honor, not in this way, because it -- it would -- it would be a more difficult -- case for us, I can see, but that you would still be talking about somebody who was engaged in wrongful conduct."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2154.141,2155.441,It's entirely fortuitous.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2174.038,2176.824,--They both engaged in inherently dangerous activity.
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2176.824,2177.257,"Yes, they both did."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2177.857,2178.49,Right.
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2178.49,2179.776,They both did exactly the same thing.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2179.776,2203.022,"And it's common in criminal law to hold criminals responsible for their unintended consequences of their criminal acts, and that's -- in your hypothetical it wouldn't be unusual at all to hold someone liable for the accidental discharge when they've taken a loaded weapon to commit a violent crime, here a bank robbery, and handled it in such a way that it goes off."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.241,2207.343,You get three extra years for having bad luck?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2207.343,2215.449,"--Well, no -- well, they're -- just to be clear, they're both subject to life imprisonment for taking the gun and committing -- and using it to commit the bank robbery."
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.209,2235.677,"Well, is this guy likely to get life for a bank robbery -- the gun accidentally goes off?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2237.945,2240.997,"--As a practical matter, no, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.026,2259.811,--What would you think -- to go back to Justice Stevens's question.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2294.882,2296.634,"I think that's correct, Your Honor--"
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.634,2297.0,All right.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2297.0,2297.617,--and that's our view.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.617,2316.398,"Now -- now, having done that I wonder if the background rule should come into play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there are many ways in which the sentence will go up."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2360.442,2365.128,"But that would be a reconceptualization of the rule of lenity, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.128,2365.528,"Yes, it would."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2366.08,2374.817,"And one -- it would be a -- as you said for this Court, in Muscarello, the rule of lenity has never been a rule where the defendant always prevails."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.455,2418.195,"No, I can't -- I can't -- the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of this that really says why they use ""is discharged"" or used -- as opposed to ""discharges""."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2426.449,2432.769,"Well, in the blue brief, they lay out the House's final version, and we have the House's final version in one of our footnotes."
2008.08-5274,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2536.07,2541.057,"Is there a difference, a practical difference, between the two formulations?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2541.057,2562.471,"The legislative -- well, the words are obviously different; the text is different; and the legislative history suggests that Congress wanted a beefed-up ""in relation to"" requirement for possession in order to make sure that incidental possession during -- you know, incidental possession while one was also committing a crime wasn't captured."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.09,2570.66,"What you're saying, to make sure I understand, is that the ""in relation to"" language modifies both ""use"" and ""possession""?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2570.66,2571.794,"--No, sir."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.146,2607.265,"""Carries"" -- what about ""carries""?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2615.704,2617.571,"--He would be carrying, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.571,2619.406,So is he guilty of the first; do we know?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2619.406,2622.692,"He would be carrying -- if I understood you, he would be carrying."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.096,2628.679,Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2628.679,2631.381,"But under this Court's decision in Smith, if it were--"
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.381,2638.302,"The carrying has to be -- although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the carrying has to be in relation to the crime."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2638.302,2640.403,--The statute does say carrying has to be in relation to--
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2640.403,2640.919,It does?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2640.919,2641.353,--Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.353,2641.836,I thought it just said
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2645.823,2646.489,I am sorry.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.489,2651.091,"No, it's a ""carrying""."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2667.684,2668.551,--It doesn't.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2668.551,2668.834,Okay.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2668.834,2669.334,You are right.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.553,2676.373,"So, you know, what happens if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2690.43,2694.668,--It's hard to see how one could meet this Court's definition in Smith for--
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2694.668,2695.301,"See, I look at Smith--"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2695.301,2698.12,"--for ""in relation to"", which was to have--"
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.12,2703.124,"--Smith says ""in relation to"" and so the carrying has to be in relation to."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2706.976,2707.459,--The underlying--
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.459,2709.292,--covers the state of mind.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2709.292,2713.261,--The carrying has to be in relation to the underlying drug crime or crime of violence.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.452,2751.269,May I just make sure I understand your position?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2763.796,2765.712,"--Definitely not, no."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.712,2767.045,So neither of them applies.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2770.097,2774.198,The -- the sentencing factors are set out separately.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.067,2781.471,None of the sentencing factors require that that factor be in -- either in relation to the crime or in furtherance of the crime?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2784.756,2789.791,"--Well, you have to be guilty of the principal offense, Justice Stevens, before you get to the sentencing factors."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.41,2796.445,But the sentencing factors need not be in relation to the crime nor in furtherance of the crime.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2796.445,2797.48,--Right.
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.747,2800.016,It has to be during the crime.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2800.016,2806.836,"--It has to be during and -- but there -- but it's not because the word ""during"" appears in the principal offense, which is how they would have our argument be."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.423,2814.858,"Why does it have to be ""during""?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2816.725,2824.397,"--It has to be ""during"" for three reasons: One, the -- the language of the sentencing factor says ""if the firearm is discharged""."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2883.836,2884.486,"There is an ""in furtherance""."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2887.138,2888.99,"Yes, Your Honor, and if you possess a firearm--"
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.99,2890.34,I want to make sure I understand.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2896.66,2897.262,--Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.262,2900.195,"Well, what does -- where does the ""during"" come from then?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2900.195,2906.801,"The ""during"" comes from the fact that the sentencing factor is in the present tense, and says ""is discharged""."
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.242,2927.198,"And you say it can't come from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, it wouldn't apply to the mere possession."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2927.198,2928.065,Exactly.
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.065,2932.584,"And the possession could be at any time, before the crime, after the crime, whatever."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2932.584,2935.637,Possession -- it would just have to be possession that was in furtherance of an underlying crime.
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.089,2946.759,"So you have to import some -- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement into the (i), (ii), and (iii)."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2946.759,2956.467,"--Some temporal limitation, and the limitation is what -- is that it must be discharged while you're committing the offense for which you're being sentenced when we're looking at sentencing factors, which is -- as set forth in 924(c)."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.467,2961.519,"Well, what if it's committed when the guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off accidentally?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2964.305,2969.423,"Again, it would turn on -- on -- it wouldn't turn on whether accidental or intentional discharge, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.375,2980.528,"No, but assume that two hours later when he's -- when he got home, he carried the gun in -- in furtherance of the crime."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2984.765,2998.656,"--If -- if it were determined that the -- the 924(c) offense, which is the possession in furtherance of a crime, were still going on at that point -- in other words, he was still possessing it in furtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it discharges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its plain terms, applies."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.656,3003.893,But then you're telling me that it need not be during as long as it's in furtherance of.

2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.871,3023.89,The discharge must be during?
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3023.89,3033.996,"--The discharge must be temporally related to the principal offense, yes, because the discharge is -- is discharged while you're in the course of the principal offense."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.364,3040.935,"I think I got everybody mixed up, because the first sentence of the statute is on the preceding page."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3064.467,3064.867,--Right.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.867,3065.517,So there it is right there.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3065.517,3066.05,"The ""during and""--"
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.05,3071.537,"""Or who in furtherance of such a crime possesses shall be sentenced. """
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3080.893,3081.993,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.631,3088.164,"Yes, exactly."
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3088.164,3088.781,Okay.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.297,3092.415,Then we have to read that by implication where it says
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3097.284,3098.153,--That's their argument.
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.153,3098.753,Yes.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3099.653,3100.453,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-5274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.105,3102.371,Forget it.
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.056,3116.114,"It's not your argument because if that was the only -- if that was the source of the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no contemporaneous requirement for the ""in furtherance""?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3116.114,3116.797,That's right.
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.347,3118.982,"The provision -- ""in furtherance"" provision--"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3118.982,3129.671,"--The reason we don't believe that's the correct reading is because, as this Court indicated in Harris, the principal offense -- the principal paragraph sets forth the complete crime, and it ends with ""shall""."
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.408,3152.0,"--And, of course, some of these difficult hypotheticals such as the one that Justice Stevens put about the gun going off while the -- while the individual is escaping, that's going to be a problem whether you adopt your interpretation or the -- or the Petitioner's interpretation."

2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3164.858,3165.725,--Just to be clear about--
2008.08-5274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.725,3167.093,"We don't have to decide that, do we?"
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3167.093,3170.379,"--It wouldn't have anything to do with whether or not it intentionally went off, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.331,3179.418,The strange thing about this case is we're talking about a category of crimes in which somebody mistakenly fires the gun.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3186.388,3194.41,"--Well, I think it's important to recognize, though, that Congress didn't want to open the door to claims that -- that the firearm was discharged accidentally."
2008.08-5274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.41,3195.01,Sure.
2008.08-5274,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3197.212,3197.862,Right.
2008.08-5274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.0,3230.25,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-5274,2,41286,scott_j_forster,,3232.119,3249.664,This Court in U.S. Gypsum was very clear when it said that far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with the intent requirement.
2008.08-5274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3302.632,3303.499,Is that helping?
2008.08-5274,2,41286,scott_j_forster,,3317.475,3317.991,"--But, Your Honor--"
2008.08-5274,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.991,3322.343,"--It just is -- they have ""during"", ""in relation to"", and ""in furtherance of""."
2008.08-5274,2,41286,scott_j_forster,,3331.383,3333.485,--Not under this Court's authority in Smith.
2008.08-5274,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3339.638,3343.542,What was the case you cited when you started your rebuttal?
2008.08-5274,2,41286,scott_j_forster,,3343.542,3345.058,U.S. Gypsum.
2008.08-5274,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3345.058,3347.077,Is that the antitrust case?
2008.08-5274,2,41286,scott_j_forster,,3352.029,3353.398,I believe it is.
2008.08-5274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.504,3363.504,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
