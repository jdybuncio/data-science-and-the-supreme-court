2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.439,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1159, the Board of Trustees of Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,11.172,13.908,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.975,71.66,What if the inventor had not been an employee?
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,84.052,90.908,"Well, Your Honor, the act deals specifically with independent contractors, and -- the regulations at least do."
2010.09-1159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,117.908,125.962,"That seems to be a factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,160.635,164.706,"--That's what they say, Your Honor, and I would submit that is plainly not correct."
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.187,237.235,"Just -- just as a hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much less employed by a Stanford project funded by the Federal Government, entered into this kind of an agreement with somebody that he had been working for."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,238.587,272.142,"Well, I think you have to look very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak loosely and categorically about the facts, but what -- what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set of facts, not affiliated with the university, and they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention, and that later the university takes that conception of an invention and reduces it to practice."
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.024,308.732,"--How does that change when you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as an employee of Stanford when he was at this other company?"
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,312.469,326.36,"Well, you would -- you -- I think you are now in a zone where one of the things that has to be considered is the equitable character of any assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future invention."
2010.09-1159,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.296,364.501,"Could you tell me, assume no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties that are not involved with the Federal Government."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,375.209,377.009,"Well, it depends what's assigned, Your Honor."
2010.09-1159,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.601,431.063,"--In this case, if you do not prevail on your principal argument, have you preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was contrary to public policy?"
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,431.063,432.346,"I think we have, Your Honor."
2010.09-1159,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.832,438.949,But the court of appeals didn't seem to discuss that.
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,438.949,476.259,"--Well, I think that is at the heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the government's argument, and it is that, as the trial court here held, and as we've said in our brief several times, the inventor, because he is working here at the time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as an employee of Stanford University, is essentially working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to transfer title to this future invention to someone else because the statute has already spoken for it."
2010.09-1159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.259,498.588,"Mr. Ayer, it seems the Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the scientist saying ""I will assign"", which was the language used in the agreement with Stanford, and ""I hereby do assign"", and it seems that that was critical to the -- to the Federal Circuit's decision."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,512.532,529.559,"Well, one interesting thing about that discussion is that the very first case that we know anything about, that we're aware of, making that distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an assignment using the words 1991."
2010.09-1159,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,578.907,583.442,What have universities been doing for the last 30 years?
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,597.702,603.605,"--Universities, and -- and I think everybody engaged in research, is generally careful."
2010.09-1159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,617.596,622.9,Do those policies ever distinguish between Federally funded projects and Non-Federally funded projects?
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,622.9,625.119,I don't -- I don't know about the universe of them.
2010.09-1159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.128,719.795,--Don't you think that the--
2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,719.795,725.781,"Well, in theory -- I mean, you're cloaking yourself in the interests of the United States, but we're going to hear from their lawyer shortly."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,725.781,726.265,--Right.
2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,726.265,733.721,Do you ever have different arrangements with respect to the assignments depending upon who the researcher is?
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,746.695,750.849,I don't know -- I wouldn't tell you categorically--
2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.849,757.603,"In other words, you'd be willing -- wouldn't you be willing to sell the interests of the United States down the river to get -- to advance your interests?"
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,757.603,762.139,"--Well, we would not, I think, be willing, and I wouldn't think anybody would be willing, to break the law."
2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,764.257,769.81,"Well, but I thought the law meant that the United States got whatever interest the contractor got, right?"
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,775.131,795.795,"The statute -- the statute defines a universe of covered cases which are inventions of the contractor, which we think the other side uses those words to argue that -- that inventions of the contractor are only the ones the -- the contractor already owns by virtue of--"
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.795,797.895,"Plus the word ""retained"", don't forget that, too."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,797.895,798.328,--Right.
2010.09-1159,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,861.737,864.689,There are two things that cut very strongly against your argument.
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,907.016,907.932,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.82,942.253,But this isn't vesting it in the United States.
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,964.702,965.536,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.536,973.625,"It says when you're working on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no right to your invention as an -- as an employee."
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,984.599,992.519,"--Well, Your Honor, I would take exception to how immense it is, given the prior history in which the government simply took title to these very same inventions."
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.24,1027.592,Excuse me.
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1030.058,1030.71,--Okay.
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.777,1032.627,"Yes, where is that?"
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1032.627,1037.281,--202(d) is -- is the section -- where is it in the -- okay.
2010.09-1159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.658,1056.308,Got you.
2010.09-1159,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1056.308,1068.566,"""-- does not elect to retain title to a subject invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may consider and, after consultation with the contractor, grant a request for retention of rights by the inventor. """
2010.09-1159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1087.228,1087.813,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1105.073,1107.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1120.601,1122.668,"Mr. Stewart, could I ask you just a factual question?"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1133.308,1147.852,"The government-wide regulation that -- which was promulgated by the Department of Commerce and which identifies certain things that should be in the funding agreements, it does not require an assignment of title from the university's employees."
2010.09-1159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1162.912,1168.081,So why doesn't the Federal Government just require assignments from employees to the university?
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1168.081,1173.669,"--Well, under our theory -- first, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary, because the statute itself would give the university title."
2010.09-1159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.072,1232.857,I don't understand that.
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1245.331,1258.155,"We would certainly like to have the opportunity to do that, but to use an analogy, the Bayh-Dole Act is triggered by voluntary choices of small businesses and nonprofits to accept Federal funds."
2010.09-1159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.155,1263.209,And by -- and by the Federal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds.
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1268.545,1280.069,"If -- certainly if this Court, as I say, holds that the -- an assignment from the inventor is required, then we would like to be able to have regulations that would require that to be done."
2010.09-1159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1280.569,1297.994,"Does the -- as a practical matter, when a university is seeking a patent, doesn't it have to identify the inventors and get their -- proof of their assignment before it can claim ownership of the patent?"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1297.994,1309.366,"--Well, typically it would -- it would certainly have to identify the inventors on the patent application, and typically the university would -- whether it felt an assignment was legally required or not, it would attempt to--"
2010.09-1159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1309.366,1310.568,That's a different question than mine.
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1310.568,1311.668,--It would--
2010.09-1159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1311.668,1318.658,Does the Patent Office require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership of the patent?
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1318.658,1320.808,"--Not -- in most cases, but not necessarily."
2010.09-1159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.554,1388.783,"Could I ask -- that all sounds to me like there's an assumption about assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the section that you just recited to me says a promise to assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't give it to you."
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1388.783,1390.433,"It could be a -- I mean, there are two different things."
2010.09-1159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.395,1409.43,Is that what we're dealing with in this case?
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1421.237,1430.176,"He agreed to that, and he also agreed that he would not enter into any other arrangement that placed him in conflict with the agreement he had made--"
2010.09-1159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.176,1433.128,So why isn't that the beginning and end of this case?
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1461.128,1476.805,"--Leaving aside the question of whether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract law, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to essentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of different respects."
2010.09-1159,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.401,1501.272,"Well, but Justice Ginsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is that why can't we resolve this case in a simple way?"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1520.75,1543.099,"--Well, I -- if the Court were to hold that the agreement made with Stanford took precedence over the contractual commitment to Cetus, based either on general contract law or on the view that Bayh-Dole would prohibit the enforcement of the -- of the agreement with Cetus under these circumstances, that would satisfactorily resolve the case from the government's perspective."
2010.09-1159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1543.715,1548.586,"Mr. Stewart, do you know, is this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general problem?"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1561.494,1576.336,"--I think there are probably a lot of universities that use this language, and indeed, as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very natural to distinguish between a present assignment and a promise to assign in the future with respect to an invention that now exists."
2010.09-1159,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1621.615,1631.871,"Isn't it the case that at least some components, possibly many components, of the Federal Government for the last 30 years have been proceeding on that assumption that assignments were necessary?"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1634.823,1635.306,--Right.
2010.09-1159,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1635.306,1655.486,"And one of the amicus briefs points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law an inventor has initial ownership of invention; however, awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act to have in place employee -- employee agreements requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an invention to the organization--"
2010.09-1159,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1655.486,1668.294,"--well, the -- the NIH document is internally inconsistent, because it says at the beginning that title passes automatically to the university, but then, as you say, it states later on that an assignment is required, but that the contractor is required to get it."
2010.09-1159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.303,1713.519,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1721.075,1723.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1749.409,1764.252,"Is there a reason that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody else until they have an agreement making clear that the inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1764.252,1767.954,"Mr. Chief Justice, I know of no reason why the Federal Government cannot make that requirement."
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.393,1797.14,"So you have no problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the government could impose that, even though there's nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it wants to promote commercialization."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1797.14,1820.32,"As far as I know that has never been litigated, but I know of no reason why a Federal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to be absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay not only Bayh-Dole contracting, but contracting going all the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in 1947, that everyone assumed was in place, which is an assignment from an employee, whether it's a Federally funded invention or a privately funded invention--"
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.32,1820.755,"Well, though--"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1820.755,1821.188,--would go to the contractor.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.188,1823.021,"--Well, that's where I exactly am."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1946.467,1955.073,"Justice Breyer, let me begin with the assumption that I agree underlies the AAU brief about the situation with respect to government employees."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.24,1986.358,Is that before the executive order or after?
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1986.358,2002.784,"The executive order simply says that there can be regulations where the employment agreement, which is essentially regulatory between the government agency and the individual, can result in an assignment from the individual to the government, just as the same applies in private industry."
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.073,2012.839,"Well, but the problem with--"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2012.839,2014.256,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.256,2015.858,--Are you finished answering Justice Breyer?
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2015.858,2020.493,"What I was going to say is that there was no rule of automatic vesting of title, which is what--"
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.493,2020.976,"No, no."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2022.095,2023.528,--There's a requirement of an assignment.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.275,2056.899,"And if the employee seeks to assign to a third party in contravention of his agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what happens to that assignment?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2056.899,2059.951,"Well, there can be -- it depends on the facts, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.951,2062.653,The facts are that he was supposed to give it to--
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2062.653,2065.772,"There could be a situation where there's an order to reassign, as there was in the Heinemann case."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.772,2072.277,"--No, there's no -- what there is, is an agreement with the government that says any invention you will assign to the government."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2073.26,2073.877,Uh-huh.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.877,2077.931,"And now, in violation of that agreement, he assigns it to a third party."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2079.931,2085.852,"The question will be whether that assignment can be void under ordinary equitable principles, just as it said here."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.852,2097.826,"And what the Court said -- my reading of it, must be yours -- is in the cases they cite, that assignment to the third party is void as a matter of law because it's contrary to public policy."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2101.944,2103.98,I'm not sure which case Your Honor is referring to.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.88,2108.865,"Well, you have -- you have here L-I v. Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery--"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2108.865,2111.884,"--Well, Li v. Montgomery, is I believe--"

2010.09-1159,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2131.744,2159.197,"--Is there any conceivable reason that, under the Bayh-Dole Act, whose intent was to protect the government's interests after it's funded the discovery or implementation of an invention, that Congress would have ever wanted the university and the inventor to be able to circumvent the act by failing to secure an assignment?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2159.197,2169.569,"The purpose of the act, Justice Sotomayor, was to clarify the relationship between the contractor on the one hand and the Federal government on the other on the basis of uniform Federal--"

2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2192.501,2197.238,"--The answer, Justice Sotomayor, is given by the IPA, which is: There was no need for such a requirement."
2010.09-1159,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2201.356,2221.751,"The government just said -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor can do what they want, what sane university wouldn't enter into agreements with employees letting the employees retain title to their inventions and just sharing royalties thereafter?"

2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.449,2268.029,"But that might lead to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to get away from, which is a variety of different arrangements across the vast array of government agencies, because they will have differing degrees of interest, differing leverage with respect to what they insist on from the different contractors."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2268.029,2273.016,"--Well, Congress, Mr. Chief Justice, in the Bayh-Dole Act, was considered with a particular type of uncertainty."

2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2286.741,2287.308,Certainly.
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2287.308,2294.847,"Presumably some of them have greater degree of leverage than others and can say: Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2294.847,2304.803,"Well, certainly there are different approaches, and that is the system that Bayh-Dole left in place, which is that the relationship between the contractor and the inventor would be governed under ordinary patent contract law principles."
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.606,2312.641,"No, go ahead."

2010.09-1159,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.213,2432.301,"We -- we have a number of sample clauses in this record, and some say ""I will assign""."

2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2490.607,2491.124,That's--
2010.09-1159,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2491.124,2495.542,"Then we're talking about nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, exist?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2495.542,2507.636,"--That comes from the FilmTec decision, which relied on Justice Storey's decision in Mitchell, and it's used, again, by universities like Caltech and MIT that rely on the validity of a present assignment of future expected interest."
2010.09-1159,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2526.013,2541.107,"So in the future, the universities would be protected against a third party simply by changing the form of contract with their employees to say ""I hereby assign"", so we would have no continuing problem?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2542.423,2548.963,I -- they -- they would be protected from this particular constellation of facts that came up in this case.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.079,2560.584,"Yes, and then your clients would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't even around yet."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2574.944,2580.482,"--The point, Justice Breyer, is that all these questions are resolved in the exactly same way when we're not talking about a federally funded invention."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.517,2583.184,So if fact--
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2583.184,2584.386,Those questions might be relevant--
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.386,2611.203,"--The reason it's relevant you to, of course, if that's so, Senator Bayh and Senator Dole passed a law which could so easily be subverted by individual inventions and third-party companies that there might be a large class of cases where neither the university nor the government would actually get much of a benefit from research that the taxpayer had funded."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2611.203,2612.719,"--I don't think that's a fair inference, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.719,2613.369,Because?
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2613.369,2617.071,The fact that this has not happened at all in 30 years of the Bayh-Dole Act.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.071,2620.439,Because most people perhaps thought that they had made a valid assignment.
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2620.439,2631.164,"Well, in most situations there will be a valid assignment, but the fact that Stanford here did not get an effective assignment from Dr. Holodniy is no reason to read the Bayh-Dole Act that Congress did not intend to draft it."
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2631.681,2632.431,But it's just--
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2632.431,2632.897,--it that it doesn't--
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.897,2635.782,--it's not just that there may or may not be an effective assignment.
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2660.064,2660.766,--I think--
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.766,2666.92,And they're happy because they're -- the value of the patent is not diluted by the fact that the government is going to be doing something with it.
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2666.92,2681.446,"--I think in that situation, Mr. Chief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the government or a bona fide third-party purchaser could invoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a lawsuit for a reassignment, as is happening in Fenn v. Yale or a--"
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2681.446,2694.071,"So at the end of the day, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point -- be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by the inventor and the contractor working together."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2694.071,2695.504,--It's not that it can be circumvented.
2010.09-1159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2703.11,2703.927,There's nothing inequitable about it.

2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2718.818,2720.352,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1159,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.352,2723.388,It could refuse to fund without a clear assignment upfront.
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2723.388,2723.938,That's quite right.
2010.09-1159,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2733.779,2741.516,"Do you have an explanation, Mr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big problem off the table?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2741.516,2742.05,--I--
2010.09-1159,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2742.05,2761.929,"In other words, clearly Congress was thinking about how to protect the government's interests with respect to these patents, and to say, well, we have these interests with respect to patents that the university owns, but we don't have those same interests with respect to patents that the individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2761.929,2763.715,"--There is an explanation, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-1159,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2777.689,2778.475,Sorry.
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2784.129,2785.545,"--Correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1159,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2785.545,2809.26,"And there -- there is proof that they can go into court, an employer can go into court and show that the inventor was hired for this specific item and the law would presume or recognize the employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of that up to the nature of the contract that the university entered into with its inventors?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2809.26,2826.306,"That's precisely what happens in the context of Federal employees, it's governed by the employment relationship between the Federal Government and the employee, and it was shown in the IPA system, in the system that Attorney General Biddle talked about in '47, that the assignment came under ordinary patent law."
2010.09-1159,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2827.472,2839.28,"But the -- but the question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up on, why would Congress create this act relying on assignments and not have a provision requiring one?"
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2849.404,2851.654,--Because there was no need for such a requirement.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.991,2917.097,"But it's also remarkable the other way, that here we have many statutes that took the principle that when the government pays for an invention, the invention vests in the government."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2921.917,2923.067,"--There are three of them, Justice Breyer--"
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.067,2923.901,"All right, that's fine."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2923.901,2927.154,--and they all specifically say in terms that title shall vest.

2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.154,2944.866,"My point is that it's somewhat remarkable because of this new statute, now that happens to only to inventions in those areas that are inventions of the contractor who, by the way, invents nothing."
2010.09-1159,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2949.484,2950.101,That's quite so.
2010.09-1159,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.101,2954.222,And on your view what that means is it applies to nothing.
