1978.77-1652,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.094,We'll hear arguments next in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against Shell and the consolidated case.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,46.302,51.124,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.018,236.878,"Mr. Shapiro, I wasn't quite as clear as you seem to be as to what question is presented by the Commission's brief, because I realize that the order adopted by the commission says that on or after July 30th, 1976 all Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity will contain this provision."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,279.229,280.584,That is the position Your Honor.
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.584,288.484,"Well, that's a little different than saying that the Commission was empowered to choose this as a regulation implementing the statute isn't it."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,291.999,301.637,"Well, essentially the Commission's position is, it has made an interpretation of the statute to define what the standard of deliverability is."
1978.77-1652,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.378,350.77,When was Gas Act adopted?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,350.77,352.109,1938 Your Honor.
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.109,356.698,And this is an interpretative regulation that was adopted by the Commission in 1976.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,356.698,357.991,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.957,517.809,Do you think the Commission made this point quite as clearly to the Fifth Circuit as you are making it us?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,517.809,520.246,"Well, the Natural Gas Policy Act hadn't been passed."
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.246,528.048,"No, but I mean the difference between a simple regulation by the Commission and a provision that is implicit in the Natural Gas Act."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,528.048,544.361,"Yes, it did Your Honor it's expressly stated in that order what they expressly declared was that they made, they found this standard to be implicit in existing certificates and they said that this implicit standard should be made explicit in future certificates."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.526,556.584,Has the commission ever taken a different view?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,556.584,567.806,"With respect to it's jurisdiction and the nature of the delivery obligation, certainly not since Sunray."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.371,576.033,"Well, it should have taken a far more expensive view in this very proceeding?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,576.033,586.825,In this proceeding the commission first undertook to adopt what I would call a quantitative delivery obligation.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.825,591.805,It didn't find that to be implicit in the Act did it or not?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,591.805,600.857,It found it to be implicit in certificates; it thought originally that it was reflected in certificates and in existing contracts that underlays.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.857,602.405,In the statute or not?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,602.405,607.786,And it thought that it was permissible to impose the standard on the statute.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.786,608.54,Permissible.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,608.54,608.807,That's right.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.807,609.849,But not required.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,609.849,610.828,But not required.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.828,621.761,"And now the position is that that a prudent operator standard is implicit in the Act, but it is, that's required by the statute."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,621.761,633.212,A deliverability standard is required that assures the maintenance of delivery and this is the standard the Commission feels is the appropriate standard to achieve that result.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.249,749.811,I take it the Commission's position is that its view of the prudent operator standard is a nationwide one or and that it's independent of State law?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,749.811,773.974,"The Commission's view as to the content of the prudent operator standard has reflected in its order and I can take it no further than that at this time, is that it does refer directly to local, state and local conservation laws for example, statutory, regulatory requirements of the states relating to production."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.964,788.873,Well then does it have any content other than what it might have under the local law.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,794.757,805.712,"As far as the Commission has taken it, it does make an obligation under the Natural Gas Act, the same duty that the producers are already under--"
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.712,814.757,"But as far as you can tell from the order it imposes, no further duty than the state law does."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,814.757,817.119,As far as the decision goes at present that is right.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.119,823.241,"And so, there might be a lot of different duties depending on what state you are in?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,823.241,830.136,Producers would be operating locally in different states and the nature of their duty might vary locally as a result.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.045,860.286,But if -
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,860.286,862.471,And they had adopted it to the Federal obligation.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.471,873.856,"But if the state hadn't allowed the rule about what the allowable production was, would the Commission, does this case suggest the Commission could set a different one or not?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,873.856,888.144,"No, the Commission was quite careful not to try and setup as a result of this standard any requirement that would go beyond or go into conflict with what the state required with respect to production."
1978.77-1652,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,946.025,949.104,May I ask this question in that connection?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,964.286,969.387,I don't know that for purposes of this case we would have to treat them as significantly different.
1978.77-1652,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1009.508,1018.74,"When acreage is committed, does that mean that all of the necessary drilling has been accomplished or does that lie ahead in the future?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1018.74,1023.335,I think it sometimes means that there will be additional development.
1978.77-1652,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1045.05,1066.896,"Well under this order, is it your view that the Commission could say it to a company that had dedicated say a 1000 acres, you aren't drilling enough holes to accomplish the deliverability that we think is appropriate and you must accelerate the drilling of holes or wells I suppose you would say?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1066.896,1080.716,What the Commission would look to is whether it would be prudent under the state standards for the operator to drill additional holes in order to meet his delivery obligation.
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.781,1107.572,"Mr. Shapiro I suppose the law has said that, keep your nose out of production and gathering even if it serves some deliverability and I suppose you can say then, Congress just said don't use this means of guaranteeing the service obligation."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1107.572,1108.772,That I think -
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.772,1110.439,But you don't think the statute says that -
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1110.439,1111.731,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.731,1118.291,"It says that production of gathering is not your business, but you say it is your business as long as it serves a service obligation."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1118.291,1140.621,"Yes sir, the analysis really is that Section 1(b) anything that is within the affirmative grant in Section 1(b) of jurisdiction over sales is not barred by the production and gathering exclusion that's what the Court has held in cases like Interstate Natural Gas Company against FPC in 331."
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.158,1165.829,But that just leaves the exclusion out of the Act?
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1165.829,1172.654,It leaves in place the state's jurisdiction over the manner in which production will be -
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.654,1181.392,"But it's enforceable, the thing that is excluded by the Act is then enforceable by the Commission, is it not?"
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1181.392,1182.468,It does make the state standard â€“
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.468,1188.088,It shows some rational connection with the service obligation.
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1188.088,1188.833,Yes sir.
1978.77-1652,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.833,1190.247,But you said that -
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1190.247,1199.244,"Well, the consequence otherwise is to leave an enormous gap in the regulatory scheme that Congress intended to fill."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.244,1206.077,"That maybe so, but the Commission hadn't discovered that enormous gap for quite a while."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1206.077,1210.821,"Well, the need for defining it as I have explained became more and more urgent in the late 70s."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.821,1217.071,"Of course, it took quite sometime for there to be discovered any obligation over producers at all."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1217.071,1228.821,"It took many years, it was 1954 before that was fully developed and it was 1964 before Sunray, so that this been a process of gradual development."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.077,1258.604,"What if some State dismantled its enforcement and its rules and said that we're going to deregulate it, you know, just turn the producers lose, we aren't going to put them under any conservation orders or anything else."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1264.584,1290.921,"I think that in the absence of specific conservation requirements by statute and regulation within the State, the Commission would look to the general common law applicable to relationships among lessors and lessees, which also implies a prudent operator standard and an obligation not to produce in a way that damages the property."
1978.77-1652,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.921,1301.176,"So there is some, so you suggested as soon the Commission decides that some State standard doesn't satisfy it, it will go off on its own."
1978.77-1652,0,28126,howard_shapiro,,1301.176,1306.334,"No, I think that the Commission will look to what are already valid state standards."
1978.77-1652,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1335.063,1339.107,Mr. Hill.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1339.107,1342.416,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1652,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.833,1557.918,You weren't up against any express limitation on the Commission's jurisdictions either.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1557.918,1559.67,That's right Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1652,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.594,1583.469,I don't blame you.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1583.469,1584.186,Excuse me.
1978.77-1652,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.186,1586.402,I don't blame you.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1586.402,1597.262,And that is whether or not the Commission has the authority to utilize and in fact is required to utilize the provisions of Section 4(d) and 7(b) to significant declines in service.
1978.77-1652,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.809,1604.206,You don't.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1612.106,1615.791,"Well, my hope is that the Court in deciding that."
1978.77-1652,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.714,1623.011,So you're defending that?
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1623.011,1624.367,"In that sense, yes."
1978.77-1652,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1624.367,1626.972,You maybe just weren't going to defend it in your argument.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1626.972,1630.163,That's right.
1978.77-1652,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.079,1699.022,Do you believe that some body of law is implicit in the Act such as Mr. Shapiro has said.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1699.022,1727.467,I believe that building upon this Court's decision in Sunray and Southland that they're clearly are obligations to continue service under the Act and that obligation requires a producer when he's contemplating a significant reduction in service to come to the Commission and say these are the reasons that I can't meet the production level that I've been providing and I want a reduction in service under Section 4(d) or to accomplish a partial abandonment under Section 7(b) of the Act.
1978.77-1652,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.467,1731.657,But that isn't the reason the Commission gave is it for its interpretative regulation?
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1731.657,1746.44,"Well, the Commission repeatedly refers to the Sunray case and the Sun Oil case in Order 539(b) and actually going back to Order 539 and they repeatedly rely upon the Southland case in their brief for this Court."
1978.77-1652,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.414,1779.365,But you say there's something either in this Court's decision or in the statute which authorizes the development of some sort of a Federal service standard.
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1779.365,1782.684,"That's right Mr. Justice Rehnquist, clearly so."
1978.77-1652,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.466,1786.447,Clearly in the Act or clearly in this Court's decision?
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1786.447,1796.165,"Well, I think it's found in-between the two and I think it becomes clear when one imagines the step passed Sunray and Southland."
1978.77-1652,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.156,1831.961,Where does that leave the exclusion?
1978.77-1652,1,19231,charles_hill,,1831.961,1842.246,That leaves the exclusion of the operation of the exclusion in essentially the same place that it is with respect to the Commission's current application of 4(d) or 7(b).
1978.77-1652,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.891,2324.5,Mr. Johnson.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2324.5,2326.075,Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1652,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.521,2566.072,But Mr. Johnson aren't the states still regulating it?
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2566.072,2571.872,"Yes sir, they are Your Honor and we don't believe there is any gap in regulation."
1978.77-1652,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.872,2577.808,There was any gap to inspect just production and gathering.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2577.808,2583.135,We believe Your Honor that the states are regulating the production activities.
1978.77-1652,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.543,2592.371,But at the time the Natural Gas Act was passed.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2596.684,2598.992,"No, I think that -"
1978.77-1652,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.992,2606.866,Had it been held at the interstate Commerce of Commission for bad the states from a regulating production and gathering.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2606.866,2609.024,"No sir, I think the states were doing that."
1978.77-1652,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.155,2619.263,But I thought you are already saying that the reason the Commission never got around this until 1976 was because the states were actively regulating.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2619.263,2619.684,Yes.
1978.77-1652,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.684,2625.218,"My question is, why did they get around to it in â€˜76 if the states haven't ceased regulating."
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2625.218,2627.439,We have a great deal of difficulty answering that question.
1978.77-1652,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.532,2633.679,May be I should ask you â€“
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2633.679,2636.226,The Commission argument that regulation -
1978.77-1652,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.226,2642.205,"The market price has something to do with it, in the ratio between the interstate price and the intrastate price â€“"
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2642.205,2655.126,"Your Honor, we believe that this whole proceeding as a result of erroneous assumption on part of the Commission on the consumer advocates that producers will not produce their gas unless the Commission makes them do it."
1978.77-1652,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.022,2669.316,"Yes, but isn't it conceivable that he can get a highest amount of income by selling in the local market rather then selling in interstate commerce."
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2669.316,2670.453,Your Honor that argument.
1978.77-1652,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.453,2671.795,It is theoretically possible they say.
1978.77-1652,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2671.795,2680.247,Your Honor that argument was made before the Commission in the Court of Appeals prior to the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act in November of last year.
