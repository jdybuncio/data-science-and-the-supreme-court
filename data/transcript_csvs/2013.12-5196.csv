2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.165,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-5196, Law v. Alfred H. Siegel, Chapter 7 Trustee."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,8.969,12.043,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-5196,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,28.476,29.382,Excuse me.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,35.286,45.924,"Congress, in Section 522(k), specified specifically that a debtor's exempt property is not liable for any administrative expense."
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,82.612,88.297,"I am somewhat taken aback by your constant reference -- your repeated references to ""wards of the State""."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,99.574,102.259,"--This is his last $75,000, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,102.259,102.853,Yes.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,107.304,111.678,It's -- it's about -- I'm not sure what the median net worth--
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,111.678,114.021,"It's less than $70,000."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,120.924,126.126,"--Well, I think what's going on here, Your Honor, is actually a federalism principle."
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.404,184.227,"I don't follow that, because I thought that $75,000 would go to satisfy part of the claim, that there would still be the legal fees unpaid."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,184.227,187.476,All his creditors -- the debts that existed beforehand--
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.476,188.039,Yes.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,230.115,243.0,"--Well, the first 280,000 have been satisfied, and the trustee was not obligated by any law to pursue the administration of the estate in a way that would be cost-ineffective."
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,262.166,264.664,What was -- what was the trustee supposed to do?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,291.06,312.161,"Well, the trustee, in that situation -- and the trustee handbook, pages 4-3, 4-4 of the trustee handbook that the United States Office of Trustee puts out, notes that administrators on the estate ought to assess whether or not pursuing a claim will be an effective -- will yield an effective return for the estate."
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,341.914,343.351,Can we talk about that policy?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,343.351,344.117,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,344.117,358.281,"I mean, it would seem to me that a court's sanctioning power is among one of the most respected and longstanding powers."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,370.371,371.278,"Well, inherent power--"
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.278,380.414,"Meaning, you want to read a preclusion of the inherent power out of -- not from an express term, but implicitly."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,380.414,382.288,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,410.23,411.964,But you are talking about the inherent power.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,413.494,413.884,--Not--
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.884,416.852,"--inherent power, can't use that property."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,418.18,430.394,"--My point is that there is no longstanding tradition of the same vein of a court being able to sanction, to be able to say, you owe attorneys' fees for this bad conduct."
2013.12-5196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,540.551,569.508,"Your position is that the trustee can take no action to make the estate whole in the event of, say, Justice Alito's type of hypothetical, the bank -- the estate bankruptcy trustee spends $125,000 in legal fees to bring property back to the estate that had been concealed by wrongful conduct of the debtor and the debtor still gets $75,000 of that?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,573.741,583.41,"--Of course, as was the case here, there was a denial of discharge, the classic and serious penalty for debtors who engage in misconduct before a bankruptcy court."
2013.12-5196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.246,600.981,What about the house?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,612.522,614.163,"Two points, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.198,648.305,The same thing is true of certain retirement funds.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,648.305,650.43,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.43,667.813,"So if, in fact, the person has $4 million in this special retirement fund account and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied nonstop, etcetera."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,667.813,682.245,"Congress has amended Section 522 already eight times since 1978, about once every 4-1/2 years, if my math is correct, to fine-tune the extent to which debtors can claim exemptions."
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,796.964,805.914,"When he takes that $75,000 and assuming he doesn't pay debts with it and he invests it, what happens to the income on that investment?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,809.1,813.068,"--It's actually even less friendly to the debtor than that, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,855.02,857.613,"That's California, but that's not necessarily every other State."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,857.613,871.856,"Those States that give a homestead exception, and that's 48 of 50, all, with the exception of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which use the Federal homestead exemption, all of those -- the vast majority of those States have a reinvestment principle."
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.395,900.297,"--Are you saying that he must spend the $75,000 on a new residence within how many -- what period of time?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,900.297,901.141,"6 months, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.141,901.813,6 months.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,907.811,913.183,California law says it needs to be reinvested within 6 months in a homestead.
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.599,936.08,"Then if 6 months runs, and he hasn't purchased a new home, then the $75,000 goes where?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,936.08,939.953,--It is available to his creditors.
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.953,941.25,They have been paid already.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,941.25,942.093,That's right.
2013.12-5196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.438,981.219,So then what you said before needs to be modified.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,987.841,995.024,"--The $75,000 is not protected from any creditor who might have a claim to it."
2013.12-5196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.958,1007.598,When you say 100 percent?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1007.598,1017.921,"--The -- his primary creditor was a judgment creditor who had a debt of $160,000; negotiated it down to $120,000 in exchange for being paid first."
2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1019.718,1025.841,"So what you started with, oh, this is a terrible sanction, he's denied a discharge and all that, that doesn't mean a thing to him, does it?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1028.402,1032.618,This debtor does not have any remaining debts.
2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1087.503,1093.735,"I should know this, but who's going to get stuck with the extra couple hundred thousand dollars?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1098.702,1103.933,"It's really the trustee's law firm, which is an arm of the trustee."
2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1103.933,1107.12,"They don't recoup that from anywhere else, right?"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1108.775,1110.51,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.257,1118.458,Do they get a thank-you letter from the--
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1120.286,1130.019,--The primary authority that my friends on the other side used to support their reading of the statute is the Marrama case.
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1191.164,1201.222,"In the Malley case, Justice Souter said that if this is not what Section 105(a) was intended for, it's hard to see what Section 501(a) was intended for."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1203.925,1205.362,"We do disagree, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1275.178,1279.692,"But, Mr. Hellman, (k) of course talks about exempt property."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1279.692,1280.676,Yes.
2013.12-5196,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1280.676,1286.408,Is there a possibility of reading the statute such that the exemption just never comes into effect?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1288.969,1289.5,Yes.
2013.12-5196,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1289.5,1290.969,"--(l) says,"
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1322.238,1323.113,Two points.
2013.12-5196,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1325.643,1326.44,Yes.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1328.799,1338.295,--That objection -- that objection would not be well founded because it is undisputed that Petitioner is entitled to his homestead exemption under California law.
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1384.276,1397.88,So you're saying a creditor could not have objected when your client claimed the exemption on the ground that the exemption is going to prevent the discovery -- the disclosure of the fraudulent nature of this mortgage.
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1401.299,1403.346,The objection was proper.
2013.12-5196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1409.827,1410.796,And why is that?
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1410.796,1418.684,"--Because Section 522, the way it works is that the question is are you entitled to the exemption under State law."
2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.782,1525.28,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-5196,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1525.28,1526.046,Thank you.
2013.12-5196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.046,1533.261,Mr. Katyal.
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2641.627,2643.813,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-5196,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2746.817,2748.895,"Ms. Harrington, you clearly have the facts on your side."
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2780.602,2783.757,What we're asking to do is look at all the provisions of the Code together.
2013.12-5196,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2835.908,2839.609,What is the -- you do have good facts on your side.
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2846.98,2850.853,"I mean, if it's a negligent -- negligent failure to list the asset, then I don't think--"
2013.12-5196,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.853,2858.477,"You know, it's a -- it's a bank account that's held in, you know, a separate name or it's separate real estate."
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2867.599,2889.713,"--I think if they do it in such a way that then they spend the assets -- so the way this issue usually comes up, the way it's come up in most of the courts of appeals is that a debtor tries to hide a nonexempt asset and then wastes the asset in some way, usually by spending it, and then when it's discovered, this is how it came up in the Malley case in the First Circuit, then the Bankruptcy Court surcharges the exempt property to sort of compensate the estate for the wasted nonexempt property."
2013.12-5196,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.022,2907.675,"Well, then it -- then it becomes a not very unusual exercise of authority."
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2916.515,2921.825,"--I don't think it happens terribly often, and when it does happen it isn't very often that the debtor spends the money that he's concealing."
2013.12-5196,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.36,2960.341,"Is there any case law -- because 522 says in (b), it says"
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2990.829,2991.47,None that I am aware of.
2013.12-5196,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.857,3006.369,"I mean, you first have to get to the thing where the -- we are pretending to put the creditor, the bankruptcy judge, as if he were another creditor."
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3019.864,3027.753,"--Well, the majority of the cases, it's not so much that there's been an objection to the exemption, so much as the exemption has been disallowed at the end of the case or surcharged."
2013.12-5196,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.322,3045.072,You see what I mean?
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3058.927,3060.255,--Right.
2013.12-5196,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.652,3099.55,"Ms. Harrington, at the cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the distinction between two situations: One, an action by the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving the creditors unsatisfied."
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3115.7,3137.879,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I think the distinction we were trying to make was more what I was discussing with the Chief Justice, which is when a debtor wastes nonexempt assets and can't turn over, nonexempt property, can't turn it over to the estate, and so then is forced to turn over exempt property so that the surcharge doesn't pay attorneys' fees; it just compensates the estate, and by extension the creditors, for property that should have been turned over."
2013.12-5196,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3233.84,3234.918,I'm not sure I understand that.
2013.12-5196,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3247.975,3255.347,"So our view is that he could have -- the court could have imposed a sanction, and that would not have been a prepetition debt, so it wouldn't have been discharged."
2013.12-5196,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3267.952,3269.326,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-5196,3,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,3271.2,3275.902,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-5196,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3454.6,3455.813,"Thank you, counsel."
