2018.18-96,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.36,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-96, Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association versus Blair. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,8.36,21.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the wake of the nation's failed experiment with prohibition, the Twenty-First Amendment restored to the states the powers that they previously had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,59.68,110.0,"Could I ask you to clarify for me your position? Justice Sutton, in his dissent, basically said, if your legislature came and said we don't want out-of-state wholesalers, distributors, or retailers to be in our chain of distribution, because they're going to take business away from our local enterprises, period, end of story -- are you saying that the state can do that? Are you disagreeing with Justice -- with Judge Sutton? Or do you think that there's an economic protectionism -- protection against what a state can do?"
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,110.0,121.68,"So I don't think that there is an economic protectionism exception to the Twenty-First Amendment, but even if there were one, as Judge Sutton recognized in applying his test to the two-year residency requirement in this case --"
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,121.68,122.16,The problem is --
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,122.16,122.96,-- we would still prevail.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.96,128.68,"Well, except we have a difficulty there, which is you can't look at legislation piecemeal."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,161.16,164.64,"So, Justice Sotomayor, that -- that gets us into a severability question."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.12,168.0,But -- but let's go back to my initial question.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,203.56,203.92,No.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,206.56,208.16,I know you want to limit it to producers.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,215.64,216.32,Well --
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,216.32,225.24,"-- you can slice and dice as much as you want, but is it your position that the Twenty-First Amendment makes all of our other jurisprudence wrong?"
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,225.24,233.72,"No, it's not, and -- and let me explain how to harmonize it. Granholm -- Granholm mandated a historical test."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,252.64,253.2,But they could have --
2018.18-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,253.2,266.56,"Can I come back to the -- what I -- where I thought Justice Sotomayor started, and ask you just very simply, can a state enact a 10-year residency requirement and, if not, why not?"
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,266.56,272.28,There would not be a dormant Commerce Clause problem with a 10-year residency requirement.
2018.18-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,280.48,280.72,Okay.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,296.52,320.32,"It would not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem because the whole point of the Twenty-First Amendment was to constitutionalize the pre-prohibition powers, which included the power to discriminate against out-of-state interests. If you think about the -- the three-tier system and the in-state wholesaler requirement, for example, that this Court in Granholm itself said was unquestionably legitimate, that discriminates against out-of-state interests."
2018.18-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,320.32,320.4,Okay.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,346.88,362.48,"I still don't think there would be a dormant Commerce Clause problem with that. Now, under Bacchus, if you're looking at the language in Bacchus, Bacchus does talk about economic protectionism, but it does so in the context of a case that was discriminating against out-of-state products. If the rule from Bacchus --"
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,362.48,365.64,Wholesalers. Bacchus -- Bacchus is --
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,365.64,374.6,"Well, it -- it involved wholesalers, but it involved a tax -- it involved a tax exemption that applied only for in-state products rather than out-of-state products."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,375.0,375.4,"Well, under your theory --"
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,375.4,378.28,-- the tax was collected through the wholesalers.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.28,379.16,"Yeah, that's the problem."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,396.04,404.08,"Because, under Granholm and under the history pre-prohibition, states could do virtually what they wanted within their borders but not everything."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,439.48,442.32,Then Ziffrin -- then Ziffrin was wrong? One of the cases you rely on.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,447.72,447.88,Uh --
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,447.88,458.72,And -- and Ziffrin basically said you can discriminate in terms of taxes basically.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,458.72,460.48,But not based on products.
2018.18-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,516.44,530.28,"Does it apply the Commerce Clause? I mean, if you go back to 1920, maybe they said you can only be sold on the basis of race or the basis of gender or some -- I mean, it can't be 100 percent whatever they did in 1920."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,530.28,546.16,"Well, that's right, but that's because the Twenty-First Amendment and the pre-prohibition powers that we're talking about are -- are powers related to overriding the dormant Commerce Clause specifically, not other constitutional provisions like the First Amendment or -- or partially these others."
2018.18-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,546.16,565.16,"So now, in other words, your position, your view is all the other amendments apply, okay, the Commerce Clause applies too as long as it wasn't part of the distribution system in the Wilson Act."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,565.16,568.08,And -- and that --
2018.18-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.08,580.56,"But, if it's part of the distribution of the Wilson Act, then it's free of Commerce Clause, but, otherwise, it's subject to it, and it's also subject to everything else."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,580.56,581.56,"Well, I -- I wouldn't quite --"
2018.18-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,581.56,583.84,Is that -- is that basically -- have I got it basically right?
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,583.84,584.2,No.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,607.76,644.4,"So that's where you're wrong because the law then did provide for racial discrimination, and there's nothing in the provision that limits itself to the Commerce Clause. It just says: The transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited. I don't actually see in that any reference to the Commerce Clause or to any other limiting principle."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,649.0,649.4,Yes.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.96,671.32,All right.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,726.12,729.88,"So, first, I don't think the question is whether it's necessary or not."
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,738.92,739.32,"Well, we just --"
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,739.32,741.68,There's no one size fits all solution.
2018.18-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.68,742.32,I -- I agree.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,774.12,775.36,Let -- let -- let me make two points.
2018.18-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,827.48,837.6,"Well, now you're -- you're arguing that they serve a public health and safety purpose, and -- but I thought you -- you answered my previous question by saying it doesn't matter."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,853.16,854.28,So -- so I think that's right.
2018.18-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,863.08,895.52,"Well, I think you're turning -- maybe you're turning it around, and maybe my understanding of history is wrong, so you'll correct me, but I thought that the purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment was a determination by those who adopted it and ratified it that alcohol created a public health and safety problem. And I thought the purpose of the -- the -- the Twenty-First Amendment and Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment was to say this is a determination, the public health and safety determination is not going to be made on the national level."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,923.0,927.68,I -- I don't think the purpose was specifically to allow protectionist activity.
2018.18-96,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,947.24,947.4,When you --
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,947.4,948.48,If the court --
2018.18-96,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,948.48,971.92,"When you say virtually complete authority, and you've said several times the point of the Twenty-First Amendment, the purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment, the problem that I'm having in thinking about this is the text -- the text of the Twenty-First Amendment does not support that, as I read it. You mentioned delivery or use, but it doesn't just say the states have complete authority over delivery or use."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,991.4,1008.08,"Two points in response to that, Justice Kavanaugh. First, the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read against the backdrop of the inherent authority that states already had to regulate the distribution systems within their system. The Twenty-First Amendment didn't need to say that expressly because it was understood at the time. Second, this Court in Midcal said -- and this is --"
2018.18-96,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1008.08,1008.24,Wait.
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1024.92,1032.08,"So -- so I direct you to Judge Sutton's dissent in the Sixth Circuit, which walks through the understanding of state authority -- of state authority at that time."
2018.18-96,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1032.08,1050.8,"I -- I -- I've gone through all that, and I -- and I don't see that in the Webb-Kenyon Act, that the -- the things that led up to that were not the -- the Act was not, as I understood it, enacted to enable states to enshrine protectionist legislation into state law."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1050.8,1057.64,Those -- those statutes were enacted in order to avoid circumvention of certain inherent state powers by importing product into the --
2018.18-96,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1057.64,1061.44,"When they wanted to -- when they wanted to remain dry states, as I understood it."
2018.18-96,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1061.44,1068.12,"But, when the Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, obviously, that was the end of prohibition."
2018.18-96,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.52,1112.4,"Thank you, counsel. General Franklin."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1112.4,1133.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly stated, most recently in Granholm itself, that Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment gives states virtually complete control over how to structure their domestic liquor distribution systems. Now questions have obviously arisen already this morning about whether residency requirements were -- were part of that structure."
2018.18-96,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1168.84,1169.08,Mr. --
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1169.08,1170.12,-- just couldn't be the law.
2018.18-96,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1170.12,1178.16,"Mr. Franklin, you're representing quite a number of states, including Tennessee, I guess."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1211.44,1241.76,"Well, I agree with my co-counsel that there wouldn't be a dormant Commerce Clause claim there because the Twenty-First Amendment, as he stated, was designed to supplant or displace dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Now there may come a point where the residency requirement is so extreme or so excessive as to be truly arbitrary, and then it could fail the Fourteenth Amendment's background presumption all --"
2018.18-96,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1241.76,1246.96,"Well, it's not arbitrary if you are intending to promote economic protectionism."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1259.92,1275.28,"Well, for example, it's our position in this case that the interplay between the initial two-year residency requirement for a license under Tennessee law and the 10-year renewal requirement, it's hard to see a rational basis for that."
2018.18-96,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1284.52,1284.8,Why --
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1284.8,1287.68,-- minimal rationality requirement under the Fourteenth amendment.
2018.18-96,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1287.68,1293.32,"Why is that? To pick up on Justice Kagan's question, economic protectionism is rational."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1307.04,1310.2,My comment went simply to the interplay between --
2018.18-96,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1310.2,1310.4,I know.
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1310.4,1313.28,-- the initial requirement and the subsequent requirement.
2018.18-96,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1313.28,1325.8,"Yeah, but the 12 years, no dormant Commerce Clause problem, you said, and the rationality argument would be that it's designed to favor in-state retailers. That's rational."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1325.8,1333.8,"Our position would simply be that, at some point down the line, there -- there could be a failure of minimal rationality."
2018.18-96,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1333.8,1333.96,I guess --
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1333.96,1336.84,But that's certainly not the case with respect to the two-year requirement that the --
2018.18-96,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1336.84,1364.44,"Well, General, I guess the question is, if -- if -- if you're conceding that much, what's the delta? What's the difference between what the dormant Commerce Clause would otherwise disallow and what I -- I take it to -- to be your position the Equal Protection Clause would -- would permit? If it's -- if it's irrational under one, why is it rational under the other? And are we just going to re-create our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence elsewhere?"
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1364.44,1369.64,"Well, I do think it would be a mistake to re-create the dormant Commerce Clause elsewhere because --"
2018.18-96,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1369.64,1370.48,Presumably.
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1370.48,1370.84,Right.
2018.18-96,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1370.84,1378.68,But why? Isn't that exactly the invitation you're issuing us through this concession?
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1378.68,1385.56,I -- I don't think so. All -- all legislation is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's background requirement of minimal rationality.
2018.18-96,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.56,1408.64,"Suppose you -- law: Any liquor store has to use paint made in Tennessee, asphalt made in Tennessee for the parking lot, neon -- you know, I can go on. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1408.64,1420.64,"I -- I -- I suppose at some point, if we're talking about the use of paint, then we're really getting pretty far afield from the state's structuring the in-state distribution and sale."
2018.18-96,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.64,1431.32,"And so there's just as good a reason for saying the out-of-state owner has to be -- live here for 12 years, as there is to say paint."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1438.84,1444.44,"But this -- the statute here, Your Honor, goes to the question of who can sell to whom and on what terms."
2018.18-96,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1454.88,1480.48,"I -- I guess, Mr. Franklin, the -- that a question that followed from my last is wouldn't it be a better idea if we said the dormant Commerce Clause does apply, and then let the state come back and say we can meet that test; we have real health and safety concerns here, and our law is well tailored to address those concerns. And so it's not a dormant Commerce Clause violation."
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1480.48,1497.12,"I -- I think that approach, which is essentially Judge Sutton's approach, would still embroil the courts in the kind of line drawing that the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to relieve them of by -- by creating what this Court has called an exception to the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause."
2018.18-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1618.4,1652.68,"As Justice Kavanaugh pointed out in an earlier question, the Twenty-First Amendment is about the transportation or importation of alcohol into a state. How do you get from there to a durational residency requirement that is imposed on the owner of a retail outlet in the state? Suppose I am not a resident of Tennessee and I want a license to operate an entity that will sell only Tennessee whiskey. How would that fall within the terms of the Twenty-First Amendment?"
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1652.68,1659.44,"Well, if I can quote from Midcal in the way that my colleague was beginning to do, what the Court said there is very instructive."
2018.18-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1683.2,1687.44,It speaks of transportation for the purpose of delivery or use.
2018.18-96,1,62885,david_l_franklin,,1687.44,1695.52,For the purpose of protecting the state's ability to control the terms on which delivery or use will take place within its borders.
2018.18-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1726.56,1731.4,"Thank you, General Franklin. Mr. Phillips."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1731.4,1781.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I'd like to start with the history because it seems to me that there's a fundamental difference here, and this Court actually has answered the question of what the history of the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to get at. And the language of the Twenty-First Amendment speaks directly to exactly what the purpose of this entire exercise was. The problem that the two federal statutes were designed to deal with was the fact that states had complete authority to say we're not going to allow any use or sale of alcohol within our states and had absolutely no authority to stop the import from other states of -- of alcohol. In the first instance, in the original package doctrine, they could sell it to retailers, and then, ultimately, beyond that, they could sell it directly to consumers."
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1856.84,1872.76,"Is that your standard? Because you seem to slide back and forth a little bit between standards in your brief -- or -- or I thought that you did maybe. If -- if a state can come forward with any purpose other than protectionism, the state wins?"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1872.76,1873.68,"No, no."
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1878.64,1882.36,"Well, suppose a state comes forward and says: We like this because it's protectionist."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1883.16,1883.24,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1883.24,1884.64,-- some protectionist things.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1893.04,1893.16,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1893.16,1893.88,What happens then?
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1893.88,1894.6,Then you're in Granholm.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.32,1946.04,"The -- the argument -- look, it also says in Granholm that the Twenty-First Amendment grants the states virtually complete control as to how to structure the liquor distribution system."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1946.04,1946.6,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.6,1952.16,We have previously recognized that the three-tier structure is unquestionably legitimate.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1974.52,1975.36,"Oh, I --"
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.36,1979.24,And so -- so this amendment was enacted against a history.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1987.48,1990.2,"Well, I don't think the history does favor the other side, first of all."
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.2,1991.04,Why not?
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1991.04,1997.48,I -- it's pretty clear to me there's nowhere near 34 states that have durational residency requirements.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.48,2001.0,"Well, that may be, but they say you have to be a resident on some form or other."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2001.0,2001.28,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.28,2002.4,But there are a lot.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2002.4,2012.16,"And my -- and my client is here, as I -- as we say in our brief -- actually, both of our clients are here to say we -- we -- we are not challenging the three-tier system."
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.24,2036.6,"See, I -- I -- the problem I have is it seems -- I don't think that you would challenge a state -- the state's residency requirement moving forward, meaning that almost all of the states require their wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to be resident in the state."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2036.6,2036.76,Or present.
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2038.76,2039.48,Present.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2041.84,2043.2,I do not challenge that whatsoever.
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2043.2,2067.88,"So now the challenge seems to me why is a pre-registration or pre-licensing residency requirement of the normal length, one or two years, because I think even the dissent below thought the 14 was too -- the 12 was too long, all right, but let's concentrate on the two."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2071.28,2072.12,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2072.36,2076.6,Why is that two years not reasonable --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2076.6,2076.8,Okay.
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2076.8,2080.56,"-- given the history of what other states have done, et cetera, et cetera?"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2080.56,2080.8,Okay.
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2130.08,2136.44,"Except for the attorney general may -- may represent the government, but the legislature gave a reason."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2136.44,2141.32,"And -- and the reason it gave was, because this is alcohol, we're protecting the public interest."
2018.18-96,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2211.4,2211.96,Let's have --
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.96,2212.76,The same question.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2212.76,2213.48,I'm sorry.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.48,2224.68,"That is, yes, of course, but to have -- to be able to have what is called the three-tier system is unquestionably legitimate."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2224.68,2225.72,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.72,2231.32,Virtually complete control over how to structure liquor distribution.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2255.4,2255.72,Right.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.72,2267.72,"And, therefore, given the case law and the history and the absence of any discrimination forbidden by others, this has been the law for 100 years."
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.36,2273.36,And there we are.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2273.36,2276.0,But this law does make sense because everything you're talk --
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.0,2279.92,"I mean, you want to say their -- their law -- you want to say their law does make sense?"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2279.92,2280.0,No.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2305.8,2310.56,"Well, Mr. Phillips, I -- I -- I -- if we were here on a dormant Commerce Clause case --"
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.56,2311.28,It would be easy.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2311.28,2311.8,"-- it would be easy, right?"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2311.8,2312.6,We'd be done.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2312.6,2312.72,Right.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2316.36,2316.92,Okay.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2316.92,2318.2,-- to discuss the history here.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2320.88,2321.4,Right.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2321.4,2327.0,-- than other commodities in our nation's experience for better or worse.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2337.72,2338.6,A presence.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2338.6,2338.72,Yeah.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2344.64,2344.96,Sure.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2344.96,2345.76,-- at the -- at the history --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2345.76,2345.84,Yeah.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2345.84,2347.4,-- and dealing with the Wilson Act and Webb Act and --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2347.4,2348.92,"Thank you, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2348.92,2349.92,-- those sorts of things.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2349.92,2355.48,"Appreciate the opportunity. The case that, it seems to me, speaks directly to this really is Walling versus Michigan."
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2450.48,2451.2,So that the three --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2451.2,2452.12,They're not interrelated -- interrelated.
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2452.12,2458.68,"-- the three-tier system does not necessarily, in your view, entail favoritism of in-state interests?"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2458.68,2461.24,It probably has some --
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2461.24,2462.16,Doesn't it do that?
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2462.16,2464.4,-- some advantages but not -- not that is inherent to it.
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2464.4,2465.96,Because when we're talking --
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2465.96,2466.88,Isn't -- isn't -- isn't that the next case --
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2466.88,2468.28,-- the paragraph that Justice --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2468.28,2468.8,I'm sorry?
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2468.8,2469.52,"No, I'm sorry."
2018.18-96,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2469.52,2490.32,"The paragraph that Justice Breyer's referred to multiple times also has a quote from a Justice Scalia concurrence which that says the Twenty-First Amendment empowers the state to require that all liquor be sold by an in-state wholesaler. In other words, that is interpreting the three-tiered system, I think, to entail favoritism of in-state interests."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2490.32,2490.48,Right.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2511.6,2533.4,"But, Mr. Phillips, I'd agree with you on that, but I would think that the next case would be -- much as we've reexamined Quill, for example, and the requirement of physical presence in state, that the next lawsuit would be that, yes, this three-tier system is, in fact, discriminatory by requiring some sort of physical presence in state. And under the dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, you have a point."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2537.6,2544.68,"Well, if only because, under these circumstances, as the camel at least, or I guess I'm the nose of the camel, that's not what I'm looking for."
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2544.68,2546.84,"I think you may be, yes. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2546.84,2554.56,"I am not -- that's -- that's -- you know, it is fundamentally at odds with my client's business model to be looking to undo the three-tier principle."
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2554.56,2561.92,But isn't the next business model just to -- to try and operate as the Amazon of -- of liquor?
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2561.92,2563.56,"No, Amazon wants to operate --"
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2563.56,2564.08,Or --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2564.08,2566.68,-- as the Amazon of liquor or may at some point.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.36,2583.72,All right.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2586.12,2586.92,I appreciate that.
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.92,2626.24,"I look at the Webb-Kenyon Act, 1913, and it says you can't send liquor into a state if it's going to be possessed or sold in a -- in any manner used in violation of any law of the state. Now ""any,"" well, maybe we can work with that, but we know at the time that these states did all, or 30 or 20 or 50, have laws that said when you, in fact, structure your distribution system in our state, you have to have local residents."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2648.24,2652.0,"Well, Justice Breyer, you know, I don't know how you can just limit it to that history, though."
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.92,2663.44,"No, but there were a lot that said you have to be a resident."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2663.44,2672.36,"Yeah, but there were probably a lot, as you said earlier, that also probably discriminated on the basis of race, discriminated on the basis of ethnicity --"
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.36,2675.52,Those other amendments say they took care of that.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2682.92,2685.96,But -- but the reason why they trump is because --
2018.18-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2685.96,2686.44,-- they -- they trump it.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2687.76,2691.64,-- you can't read under the laws of the state so broadly as to mean any law.
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2707.48,2737.48,"But, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's question, I mean, I'm trying to figure out what kind of opinion we could write, Mr. Phillips, that says you win, but then, when the next case comes along and the next case is somebody that says we don't like this brick-and-mortar stuff, we don't want to have any physical presence at all, and the state is preventing that, and in doing so, the state is discriminating against out-of-state companies. And, you know, you've said that that's not valid, so we're entitled to do what we want to do too."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2737.48,2740.8,I think there are two ways you can go about this.
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.56,2774.52,"Well, we're leaving a lot of things for another day, but they all seem to be demanded by the principles that you're asking us to adopt."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2774.52,2796.16,"Well, I don't think so. All I'm asking -- the principle I'm asking you to adopt is to not discriminate against us under these circumstances where we are clearly exactly identically situated and where the state's interests in -- in protecting against alcohol can be fully protected. And leave it for another day if there are other rules that are challenged to see what those rules are --"
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2796.16,2796.92,I guess what I'm asking --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2796.92,2800.28,"-- how they operate, and what's the state's justification for them."
2018.18-96,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2800.28,2806.76,Because the hypothetical I was attempting to pose is a hypothetical where the state is acting in a discriminatory manner.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2814.96,2823.08,"Because, under certain circumstances, there may not be any less discriminatory way of achieving the state's objective."
2018.18-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.08,2824.36,"Well, but, I mean, are you incorporate --"
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2824.36,2825.28,Granholm says that.
2018.18-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.28,2830.0,-- are you incorporating the dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence completely?
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2830.0,2853.68,"Well, it's a little tricky because Granholm's a little unclear to me on that because the -- I mean, the normal Commerce Clause says if you discriminate, it's -- it's almost per se unconstitutional. Granholm didn't seem to go that far and just talked about narrow tailoring and non-discriminatory means of achieving its objective. And I can imagine in a close case it would make a difference how you deal with that."
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2853.68,2854.84,But isn't that exactly --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2854.84,2856.24,This is not a close case.
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2856.72,2862.36,"Isn't that exactly where you want us to go? Not today, of course, but tomorrow or next year."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2862.36,2863.6,Or maybe not ever. (Laughter.)
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2863.6,2863.92,And all --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2863.92,2866.0,"Only if I'm standing here, Your Honor."
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2866.0,2867.28,And we'll see you again.
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2883.8,2886.28,"I -- I -- I'm -- perhaps, but at least the state --"
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2886.28,2887.2,This is just like --
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2887.2,2888.4,-- at least the state will have the opportunity --
2018.18-96,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2888.4,2890.68,"-- just like milk, just like books."
2018.18-96,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2890.68,2898.76,"But, Justice Gorsuch, somebody is going to -- at that point, presumably, the state will say: This is why we can't regulate effectively."
2018.18-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.88,2934.84,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Dvoretzky."
2018.18-96,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2934.84,2967.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Respondents offer no administrable rule that would support even the basic presence requirement that this Court recognized in Granholm was unquestionably legitimate, and no account of the history. First, Respondents concede a residency requirement. A durational residency requirement follows from that: first, because states get to define what residency is, and, second, because the same interests that serve a presence requirement also serve a durational -- durational residency requirement. Duration facilitates background checks."
2018.18-96,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3062.12,3062.8,"Thank you, counsel."
