2006.06-134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.715,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-134, The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations et al. vs. The City of New York."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,10.997,13.574,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,45.763,57.587,Of course you could say the same thing if the mission here sold its property to someone and someone was claiming the right to possess the property by reason of the sale.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,67.098,67.864,--Uh--
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.864,71.815,"But it would clearly come within the property right exception, wouldn't it?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,79.873,92.728,"--Actually, Justice Scalia, I believe that if you had a dispute over what happened with the sale of property that it would fall within the based upon commercial activities exception in 1605(a)(2)."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.728,94.837,"Let's assume that, let's assume that exception didn't exist."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,94.837,95.727,Okay.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.727,97.868,And you had nothing but the real estate exception.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,107.019,107.722,No.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.818,151.253,But what New York is seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest in the land.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,154.659,155.642,I... I... yes.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,181.303,184.441,Can't he force a sale of the property to collect the lien?
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,184.441,186.27,This action does not.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.27,190.205,I understand that this action does not because of the sovereign immunity.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,201.998,202.795,Yes.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.743,221.725,"Well, how can he commence an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the property?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,221.725,231.205,"I do not dispute that a lien holder has an interest, a security interest in the property."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.788,262.239,You're distinguishing between rights in property and interests in property?
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,266.94,268.456,No.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.164,297.803,"The counterclaim sounds to me very much like it comes straight out of the Federal Rules, not out of any convention."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,300.16,301.879,--Yes.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.614,307.878,"Well, that's exactly what it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory--"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,307.878,322.854,"--Yes, but Congress said, in the House report Congress refers to the European Convention as the source for the counterclaim exception in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so Congress said we are taking this from the European Convention."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.807,326.651,Congress didn't really say it.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,329.008,331.913,"--Yes, that's absolutely correct, Justice."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,331.913,332.992,Good.
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.992,334.867,What was your distinction between a mortgage and a tax lien?
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,334.867,340.862,"I don't think there is a distinguished, a distinction between a mortgage and a tax lien."
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,340.862,342.706,"Well, so think they can't enforce mortgage under this?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,347.423,348.736,No.
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,366.884,373.475,"That's, that's where it's hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell the real estate."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,385.486,387.58,"--Well, actually there is."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.85,428.781,"Well, on that point in some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as opposed to an attachment."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,440.495,441.994,"Well, yes."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.211,445.633,Yes.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,445.633,458.097,"It is an interest, a security interest in the property, but it is not a right in the estate of the property, and it doesn't give any type of the possession and ownership rights that every other right in property gives."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.097,461.798,Is there New York law to that effect?
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,461.798,462.908,"Yes, there is."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.913,492.63,Because I had... I had thought that it is an estate in land in at least some jurisdictions.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,500.782,506.671,"There appears to be in different jurisdictions, different treatments of liens."
2006.06-134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,506.671,511.889,"Well, that brings up the basic question I have, is this a question of State law or Federal law?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,511.889,513.698,This is a question of Federal law.
2006.06-134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,514.793,521.758,"So even if you have different rules in different States, there is going to be one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,521.758,523.991,"--Yes, that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-134,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.113,577.329,"Had the State Department taken a position at that point, at the time the Act was passed?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,577.329,580.812,There is... not to my knowledge.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.93,604.474,--There was nothing vague about the State Department's brief in the Englewood case.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,604.474,607.692,"--No, there is not, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.402,638.649,"But anyway, at a time closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department was taking the position that a lien was an interest in land."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,638.649,640.726,"Yes, that is correct."
2006.06-134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,644.334,648.222,"Well, they just may be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were to Libya."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.222,654.595,"That's not beyond the realm of the conceivable, is it?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,654.595,657.859,It's not beyond the realm of the conceivable.
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.859,672.18,"But I take it there has never been a case in the history of the world you'll tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned money to build an embassy has ever brought a case against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won under anything like this exception, because they can't sue them."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,672.18,675.352,"Not that we're aware of, and not that we've seen--"
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.352,675.664,Ever.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,677.616,677.928,--Yes.
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.928,678.225,Okay.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,680.553,699.655,"Well, because once you lend money and you engage in commercial activity, if the claim is based upon the commercial activity, Congress had provided a separate section, 1605(a)(2) that protects the American citizen who has lent money to an embassy."
2006.06-134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.655,708.151,"And how did it work before 1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th century, embassies, if you know."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,708.151,711.009,I don't know about 19th century embassies.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.412,735.734,"Why isn't buying land that you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,735.734,750.337,"Well, this Court held in Saudi Arabia against Nelson that it's not just engaged in, related to commercial activity, but the cause of action, the claim has to be based upon commercial activity."
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.337,756.663,"So the Indian embassy could own real estate throughout New York City, which it wouldn't have to pay taxes on?"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,760.895,764.175,It depends on the use they put that property to.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.175,764.503,Why?
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,770.251,772.0,The mere ownership of the land is not--
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.0,779.122,"--It depends upon the use, and the use in this case is not... is not the embassy itself or the residence of the ambassador."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,783.84,787.869,"--As long as it's not commercial activity, it would not be taxed and--"
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.869,791.586,But the buying and occupying of it is commercial activity.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,791.586,804.034,"--Well, the buying of it, if the claim is based upon the buying of the property, under Saudi Arabia against Nelson, then the commercial activities exception would apply."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.439,818.623,"Why isn't it commercial activity for New York to say, we provide garbage services, electric services, et cetera."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,818.623,837.692,"Well, separate and apart from the jurisdictional issue, the Vienna Conventions do say that if there are fees for services provided, such as garbage collection, water, those types of services, then there is no immunity from the fees for those services."
2006.06-134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,852.951,854.748,But they pay fees and New York taxes.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,858.965,872.584,"Well, no, that does not... on the substantive issue of whether it's immune under the Foreign... under the Vienna Conventions, a tax is immune."
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.644,885.266,"And in reality, you will never get there, because the Vienna Convention deals with the substantive liability... you're talking about jurisdiction."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,893.326,895.637,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, not at all."
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.031,935.98,"The commercial activity, it's applied to that same building that you say can't be... it can't be any suit for taxes."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,935.98,936.762,--Yes.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.133,958.284,"Even... even if this, the building were only the mission and the representative, the minister to the U.N., even then--"
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,958.284,958.939,--Yes.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.939,969.108,"--the water of a municipal service, garbage collection, could be charged."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,969.108,983.383,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just as if the Indian mission went out to a private water company and said, please supply me with water, the private water company could sue, based on commercial activity, to collect for the water it had provided."
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,985.023,985.662,"Well, it's the city."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,987.74,995.956,The nature of the activity doesn't change just because it's the city providing the water as opposed to a private entity providing the water.
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.173,1000.579,"Of course, this isn't a suit for the taxes."
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,1003.093,1004.421,We are here--
2006.06-134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.421,1008.545,We are talking about a declaration as to the interest in the land.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,1008.545,1009.403,--No.
2006.06-134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1074.752,1077.969,You could easily say there has to be a relationship to the property itself.
2006.06-134,0,30735,john_jp_howley,,1077.969,1081.437,"Well, that's not... that's not what the City's position is."
2006.06-134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.752,1110.534,"Thank you, Mr. Howley."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1120.936,1127.246,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.349,1194.61,"That's always brought up to answer the problem, well, you know... let me give you a case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity, but it seems to me that the... that the lien interest has to be honored."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1234.093,1240.56,"--Well, the lien wouldn't constitute a right in the property, and that's consistent with what... the way this Court has always described liens."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.293,1244.871,Enforceable or not.
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1244.871,1253.212,"--The lien would not be enforceable against a foreign sovereign, because... at least with respect to the immovable property."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.212,1254.304,That seems very strange to me.
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1254.304,1257.148,We are only talking about--
2006.06-134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.144,1273.547,"I thought that the Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in 1985."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1287.197,1292.819,"Well, we, of course, reviewed our position in that case, and we have come to the conclusion that it was incorrect."
2006.06-134,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.708,1304.098,"Well, what about the argument that it was an interest in property."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1317.591,1318.544,I don't--
2006.06-134,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.544,1322.387,It survives bona fide... it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?
2006.06-134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1322.387,1332.585,"The other reasons you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to compensation if eminent domain is exercised."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1335.756,1338.224,"--Well, let me try to take up some of those in order."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.213,1367.04,What property is it a right in if not the immovable property?
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1367.04,1367.337,"--Well, it's--"
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.337,1372.928,And it follows that immovable property and when the immovable property disappears the lien disappears.
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1378.488,1379.254,"--Well, I think--"
2006.06-134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1397.105,1403.228,"Well, how can the, how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin waste of the immovable property?"
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1403.228,1409.617,"Well, a lien holder can bring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to understand what interest the lien holder is protecting in that situation."
2006.06-134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1446.321,1451.537,What about paragraph 3 just after paragraph 2 in the complaint?
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1478.79,1482.462,"Well, I don't... you'd have to ask Respondent's counsel exactly what they mean by--"
2006.06-134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.665,1484.227,"Well, I did in part, so he can answer."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1484.227,1486.007,Because Respondents have--
2006.06-134,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1504.344,1512.747,"In a very practical way, you're expressing that right means ownership means ownership."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1522.618,1523.664,Well--
2006.06-134,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.664,1526.35,So the title is certainly clouded by this lien.
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1526.35,1532.754,"--Well, I think liens generally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that something's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in the property."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.113,1536.096,It doesn't have to be a right in the property.
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1567.802,1583.405,"I think our arguments apply equally both to the lien holder and to the property owner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with respect to both of them a lien... the lien doesn't affect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right to exclude others, which this Court has characterized as the most fundamental of property rights."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.17,1593.324,"It affects the right to convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous right that goes along with the real estate."
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1593.324,1600.491,"Well, it has a practical consequence on conveyance because it, as Justice Ginsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title."
2006.06-134,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1629.324,1632.37,How long did the United States take the opposite position and when did it change?
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1632.37,1633.354,I'm sorry?
2006.06-134,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.354,1640.211,How long did the United States adhere to the position that's reflect in the Englewood brief and when did it change?
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1640.211,1644.708,"Well, I'm not aware that we took the position before the Englewood brief, so I think that would be 1985."
2006.06-134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.37,1712.558,What about an easement?
2006.06-134,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1717.305,1724.851,"Well, an easement I think would qualify as a right in property because at least your standard easement would provide a right of access to the property by a thoroughfare."
2006.06-134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.754,1730.395,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,1735.313,1738.453,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.413,1774.438,"Mr. Cardozo, before you go any further, I had been under the impression from your brief that you're not trying to enforce anything against, against India or against the mission."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,1785.091,1792.135,"Justice Scalia, we know that Section 1610 would preclude us from actually foreclosing."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.338,1796.135,You just asked for it to scare them?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,1797.041,1797.133,No.
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.732,1904.278,"Well, but they'll say as was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the commercial act exception covers that."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,1904.278,1908.823,"Your Honor, it may or may not cover the commercial act exception."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.848,1970.594,"The problem that actually is bothering me with your side of the case which I find difficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you have."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2002.535,2004.503,"--Let me try, Justice Breyer."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.887,2027.197,"I'm imagining a city or Belarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip and fall on ice... you know, you get a lien against the property prior to... okay."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2028.993,2029.212,--Yes.
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.212,2033.053,And in a range of subject matters.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2037.099,2054.871,"And the stopping place I think is a Federalism concept and a due process concept, because as this Court has held in a number of cases, there's a real due process question if liens are created with no concern about the effect on the defendant."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.368,2085.501,"Why didn't you just say... you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of stuff easements, which, which the other side says is undoubtedly a property interest."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2098.073,2115.223,"--Justice Scalia, they did say that and certainly if an easement is a right in property, either because of the hypothetical you just gave or a traditional easement, there is nothing different with a tax lien."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.504,2129.093,"I still have my question because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't carry around in my head all of the possible things that might be liens against property."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2164.859,2189.303,"And what I see, Justice Breyer, is when you take a look at the cases in this Court such as Connecticut against Doehr and the other cases which put limits, the constitutional limits on liens, of course if a State passed a statute that runs afoul of the various due process concerns that this Court has articulated that is certainly one check that we have."
2006.06-134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2189.303,2202.172,"Well, let's take the parking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York would make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking ticket a lien on all, all property."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2202.172,2218.712,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that would be a hard question, but if it does not run afoul of the constitutional concerns that I just articulated and it was a lien applicable not just of course to foreign sovereigns, but to any unpaid parking ticket--"
2006.06-134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2218.712,2219.071,"Yes, yes."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2219.071,2222.788,--I think that then that would come within the immovable property exception.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2222.788,2234.346,So the only thing they would have to do I suppose... you've mentioned the due process point... would be to perhaps give a hearing before the lien was declared and that would be enough?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2234.346,2238.252,"I think, I think it certainly would, Justice Souter, if in fact there was a hearing."
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.252,2247.592,"Well, provided that, provided notice of hearing was offered, the parking ticket lien would be in the same position as this lien, right... the hearing."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2247.592,2248.92,I think that's right.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.717,2254.418,"And under New York law does property, do property tax liens have some superior status?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2257.73,2264.618,"--Well, they're... as tax liens you may get into a priority fight in a bankruptcy context."
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.618,2265.71,Without reference to priority.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2265.71,2281.61,"I don't believe that they would have any different lien, any different status, although my colleague corrects me and says that yes, tax liens... tax liens do have in certain circumstances a greater priority."
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.406,2291.044,I... I had thought they had a greater priority and that they even survived purchase from bona fide sellers.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2291.044,2302.712,"That certainly, that is certainly true and a property... excuse me for interrupting... a tax lien would run forever with no time limit, for example, whereas a mechanics lien has a statutory time on it."
2006.06-134,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.537,2311.879,May I ask... may I ask this question?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2326.499,2328.716,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-134,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.716,2337.712,"And don't you think it's sort of a strange way to define a tax immunity, by... by, by describing the... the interest in immovable property?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2337.712,2343.804,"Well, we start off with the statutory language and the statutory language says right in property."
2006.06-134,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.913,2351.909,"But, but the basic issue in final analysis is whether they have to pay their taxes, isn't it?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2351.909,2352.237,I'm sorry.
2006.06-134,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.237,2356.142,The ultimate issue is whether they have to pay their taxes.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2356.142,2364.03,"The ultimate substance... underlying substantive issue is that but... and of course, the State Department even today says these taxes should be paid."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.68,2381.351,Do you know any States that don't?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2383.381,2387.302,"I believe... I believe it is fairly standard, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.302,2387.88,--Yeah.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2387.88,2391.643,"I... there may be one out of 50 States that, that don't say this."
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2391.893,2397.189,"May, may I just ask, for a kind of a footnote kind of question?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2440.39,2441.062,"--I, I agree with that."
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.189,2472.361,Yeah.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2472.361,2477.188,And I think we can also get a great deal of help by looking--
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.188,2482.467,"The... the... the European, the European treaty looks at it from the other side, you're saying."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2484.075,2491.729,"--The European Convention phrased differently looks at it from both sides, Justice Scalia, which is why they needed the words obligation."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.153,2530.323,"Would the obligations arising out of the property in the European Convention include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2530.323,2533.462,It would include a controversy over that absolutely.
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.932,2571.713,This says what explicitly?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2571.713,2574.212,--Says that there is jurisdiction over tax claim.
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.508,2579.554,Over tax liens or claims?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2579.554,2580.242,Over tax claims.
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.475,2583.49,And you don't go that far.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2583.49,2590.315,"That... we don't have to go that far because we believe we, as a... we have a right in property arising from the lien."
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.54,2655.272,Is this the Vienna Convention?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2655.272,2656.085,Pardon me?
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.709,2658.522,European Convention.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2658.522,2658.741,Right.
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2694.054,2700.005,"Well, the... the convention used language quite different than that was used by Congress."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2707.298,2710.813,"--I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not talking just about the language."
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.477,2739.848,And in some cases they used language directly from the convention and in this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying to do.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2739.848,2742.596,--Then I would say where did they get that source from?
2006.06-134,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.553,2781.581,Did their practice draw a distinction between occupied by the ambassador himself and property occupied by employees of the embassy?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2781.581,2785.799,"As a substantive matter, Justice Stevens, the answer to that question is of course yes."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.436,2836.434,"Can I ask you what, what do you get out of this case?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2848.852,2854.427,"Oh yes I think if you look, if you look at the Petitioners' brief I think they do contest that they, that they have to pay the tax."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2886.742,2887.102,"Yeah, but--"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2887.102,2887.585,In addition--
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.585,2889.397,--You say he is wrong about a lot of other stuff.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2892.271,2907.702,"--And the... the reason I believe him about that is that Congress has passed a law that says if you don't pay your taxes reflected by a judgment, whatever the amount of that tax is, you're going to lose 1110 percent of your foreign aid."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.029,2915.214,Can I... can I can ask you to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into a muddle here.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2961.118,2961.32,And--
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.32,2978.158,"So I'm still back in a different route at where I'm having the problem, which is a problem of distinguishing in principle between either your absolute principle, ""do it"", his absolute principle, ""don't do it"", or something in the middle."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,2978.158,2984.967,"--And I think the something in the middle, Justice Breyer, is if you're talking about a prejudgment lien which I think is your hypothetical."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.342,2988.919,The hypothetical was doing away with the prejudgment lien.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3011.442,3019.595,"--But Justice, Justice Breyer, in that hypothetical, you don't have a right in property until you win the case."
2006.06-134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.595,3020.547,Do you?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3020.547,3032.213,"We have, we have a, there is an in issue today our right to property and I believe that that is a distinction and I believe also... and of critical importance."
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.213,3032.432,"Well, wait a minute."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3048.848,3049.504,And if--
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.504,3052.8,You want to look at it from the embassy side too so--
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3052.8,3052.986,--Yes.
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.417,3070.869,"--Well, that's your big defense."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3076.68,3077.336,--That's right.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3077.93,3091.128,"Is it only the case that the, that the only instances in which, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say you get the house, would be instances of litigation arising out of commercial activity?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3091.128,3092.517,Yes.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3101.796,3102.015,Yeah.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3102.015,3106.167,--And you can execute unless the premises are not being used for the purposes of the mission.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3106.167,3117.18,"Now... now I take it you under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions, the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before any judicial proceedings."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3117.18,3117.899,That is correct.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3117.899,3118.772,Just because they are unpaid.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3130.814,3131.518,Of course they can.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3133.891,3136.921,You mean of course they can under their view?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3136.921,3138.031,--No.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3141.45,3141.607,No.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3141.607,3142.122,--I'm sorry.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3142.122,3142.575,Excuse me.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3145.918,3148.025,They can demand it.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3148.025,3148.275,"--No, no."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3160.224,3165.362,"Well, I haven't heard their articulation of that position, but they certainly could write--"
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3165.362,3167.394,It would seem to me to follow from what they're saying.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3167.394,3168.315,--I think it may.
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3184.043,3188.993,My hypothetical is can they demand that the lien be removed solely because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3188.993,3196.506,"They could demand that, but I don't that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act answers the underlying substantive question."
2006.06-134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3247.034,3257.372,"With reference to the offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do you have to have a judgment first?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3257.372,3257.575,No.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3279.254,3281.066,May I ask you a question in your remaining time.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3295.513,3300.903,Theoretically it would have an application in a counterclaim situation as well--
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3300.903,3301.073,Okay.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3301.073,3302.808,--Justice Souter.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3310.569,3310.803,That's right.
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3311.694,3312.147,Right.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3312.147,3320.691,"So in practical terms, with the possible exception of a counterclaim, the foreign aid setoff would simply apply to a case like this, then?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3320.691,3320.91,That's right.
2006.06-134,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3333.92,3335.826,"I was going to say, if you deny all the statutes you've got to--"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3335.826,3339.371,That is obviously the way to reconcile these statutes.
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.371,3340.73,What do you do with traffic tickets?
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3348.429,3353.224,You can't get a judgment that that is owing.
2006.06-134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3353.224,3355.582,So you can't use even the foreign aid gimmick to--
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3355.582,3363.016,"Not unless, unless the statute is changed, Justice Scalia, which we have from time to time tried to persuade Congress to do."
2006.06-134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.016,3363.532,Foreign aid--
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.532,3370.249,"Unless New York law is changed and you pass something saying you get a lien on property if you have delinquent property, parking tickets."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3370.249,3372.232,"That is right, and that would get us right back into the--"
2006.06-134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3372.232,3379.386,"--I thought that the Federal, the 100 percent withholding, relates to taxes?"
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3379.386,3380.681,--Yes.
2006.06-134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3380.681,3383.494,"Taxes, not for parking tickets or anything else."
2006.06-134,2,35653,michael_a_cardozo,,3383.494,3385.915,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it does."
2006.06-134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.206,3396.534,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-134,3,30735,john_jp_howley,,3398.751,3401.501,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-134,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3447.108,3451.699,Do you take the position that it's improper even to notice the property with the lien?
2006.06-134,3,30735,john_jp_howley,,3451.699,3457.354,"Under New York law, yes, and we have Chief Judge Fulbright for a unanimous--"
2006.06-134,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3457.354,3459.088,"I mean, let's assume that you owe the taxes."
2006.06-134,3,30735,john_jp_howley,,3459.088,3475.345,"--Well, we say that there's no right to impose the lien because the Vienna Convention and New York law prohibit the taxation of the property and you cannot impose the lien to collect something that you're not entitled to."
2006.06-134,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3495.807,3498.884,You mean we'll have to start paying our taxes around the world?
2006.06-134,3,30735,john_jp_howley,,3498.884,3500.024,"I'm afraid so, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-134,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.024,3500.665,Is that a real problem for us?
2006.06-134,3,30735,john_jp_howley,,3501.29,3501.96,I am afraid so.
2006.06-134,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3503.913,3504.569,"Thank you, Counsel."
