1977.76-6372,0,46076,william_l_skinner,,48.686,51.542,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-6372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,95.16,97.1,You are referring now to the new statute?
1977.76-6372,0,46076,william_l_skinner,,97.1,98.741,I am referring to the old statute which has a --
1977.76-6372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,98.741,106.151,"So tell us so that we have it thoroughly entirely before us, unless what the old statute is again and that what the new statute is?"
1977.76-6372,0,46076,william_l_skinner,,106.151,119.06,"The old statute does start off with a provision that no adoption can be had of man or children without the concern of living parents, it goes on then to state exceptions."
1977.76-6372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.183,163.893,But he did file one afterwards did he not?

1977.76-6372,0,46076,william_l_skinner,,187.023,206.847,"That is, but I think that that was based upon the conclusions of law that Mr. Quilloin had no standing based upon the challenged statutes which only give standings to object to adoption to the legal father, that is the father who has married the mother or has legitimated the child prior to the filing of the adoption action."
1977.76-6372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.286,263.173,"But for 11 years, he could have legitimated?"
1977.76-6372,0,46076,william_l_skinner,,263.173,266.366,"I think, I addressed that issue in my brief as mush as I could."
