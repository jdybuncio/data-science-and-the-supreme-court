1988.87-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.81,"We'll hear argument now on Number 87-470 Fort Wayne Books, Inc. versus Indiana, and Number 87-614, Sappenfield versus Indiana."
1988.87-470,0,33536,john_m_weston,,15.862,37.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, recently in Hustler Magazine versus Falwell, this Court reaffirmed the need to give adequate breathing space to First Amendment freedoms in order to protect them."
1988.87-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.414,101.337,"Mr. Weston, in Sappenfield there wasn't any seizure, was there?"
1988.87-470,0,33536,john_m_weston,,101.337,102.489,"--That's correct, your Honor."
1988.87-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.489,109.221,"So, what is going to chill people about simply upholding the possibility of prosecuting under the statute?"
1988.87-470,0,33536,john_m_weston,,109.221,128.695,"But in Sappenfield, your Honor, although it was brought pursuant to the Indiana criminal RICO statute, the civil RICO statute is a direct adjunct of that and given the collateral estoppel provisions of civil procedure, forfeiture and subsequent restraint and so forth are automatic upon conviction."
1988.87-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.787,151.209,"But, peddling obscenity is not presumptively protected by the First Amendment."
1988.87-470,0,33536,john_m_weston,,151.209,151.579,--No.
1988.87-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.835,164.168,Nothing happens to these people in Sappenfield until there is a determination.
1988.87-470,0,33536,john_m_weston,,164.168,193.678,"--That's correct, your Honor, except to the extent that someone like Sappenfield, a book seller, or someone in another endeavor subject to the possible application of obscenity law faced with the draconian potential sanction of eight years in a criminal jail sentence for violation of the statute, which at best is inelastic with a limited scienter standard, will certainly think more than twice before electing to deal with sexually oriented material."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1861.666,1869.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, let me just... Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1869.77,1874.755,"xxx 47, whatever that number is, out of this case?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1874.755,1876.677,"We think we're here, your Honor."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1891.837,1894.248,"Well, now, you we're the prosecuting attorney--"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1894.248,1895.079,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1895.079,1895.9,--in 4447?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1895.9,1896.239,Right.
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.239,1898.522,"Well, how is that case here?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1901.855,1905.255,"Well, it's a procedural question, your Honor."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1922.077,1922.786,We accepted the--
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1922.786,1923.226,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1923.226,1924.679,--In 4447?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1924.679,1925.687,Yes.
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1926.558,1927.339,"Well, why doesn't--"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1927.339,1928.7,"--Well, because... I'm sorry."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1928.7,1929.882,--Go ahead.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1929.882,1937.446,"The confusion, your Honor, is that the defendants in that case did not become petitioners in this case."
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.832,1946.252,The case just got here on its own?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1947.814,1964.513,"Well, your Honor, this Court accepted certiorari for... under a petition that came from a cause number that included 4447 and included Fort Wayne."
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.154,1980.014,Maybe we granted it improvidently then.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1980.014,1980.835,Very well--
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.835,1985.728,I don't recall that we've ever let one side beat up on another who is not even here.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1985.728,1994.944,"--Justice Scalia, I think if I could address my remarks to the overall issue of the RICO laws and the only reason that the Indianapolis--"
1988.87-470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.944,1998.667,Don't you sign with the clerk's office who represents who?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,1998.667,1999.816,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.777,2002.468,"Well, did you sign that?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2005.41,2006.201,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.201,2007.463,You're sure?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2007.463,2007.971,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2007.971,2016.459,ISSI and Plaza Entertainment and Burton Gorlick.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2016.459,2019.91,Those were all of the defendants who were rearranged--
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2019.91,2023.913,"Well, what you're submitting, does that go also for them?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2026.184,2033.209,"--Well, they are here as not... pursuant to this Court's rules, they are here as nominal respondents because they did not elect to come forward as petitioners."
1988.87-470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2035.7,2037.082,"Well, how come you're representing them?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2037.082,2044.615,"--I represent Sappenfield, Fort Wayne and if 4447 is here, I represent them as well."
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.954,2105.027,"Mr. Goldsmith, will you help me with the issues a little bit."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2120.557,2122.568,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.388,2127.059,"Well, that's right."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2140.149,2147.145,I don't agree that that could necessarily happen.
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.145,2148.254,Can it happen under your statute?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2149.215,2158.549,"Justice White, I think in terms of post-trial sanctions, it has not happened in any one of these cases."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.549,2159.14,I know.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2164.025,2173.349,"My position, Justice Stevens, is post-trial that becomes an Eighth Amendment question, which could or could not occur, depending on the proportionality of the response."
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.349,2175.022,"Oh, I'm not asking you about its constitutionality."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2191.094,2191.752,I could--
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.752,2192.883,If that's all you've proved?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2192.883,2195.715,--I could ask for that remedy and--
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.715,2197.595,And would you be entitled to it under the statute?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2197.595,2199.967,--It would be a proportionality question.
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.209,2205.861,"So, the only objections to that relief would be constitutional objections?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2205.861,2211.146,If I convince the judge and the jury and then the outside--
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.146,2217.83,That the three books were obscene and they were sold in a particular store and the rest of the store was filled with nothing but Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2217.83,2218.54,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.54,2224.273,"Well, didn't... wasn't there a seizure of the entire store before trial?"
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2224.273,2225.024,There was a--
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.024,2230.858,Based on just probable cause to believe that obscenity was being sold there?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2230.858,2232.36,"--In the Fort Wayne case, that's true."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.36,2234.511,A few items of obscenity being sold there?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2234.511,2238.541,"Well, it was based on the allegation that there had been 39 prior convictions at those three stores."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.541,2239.573,Yes.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2248.419,2258.567,"Nor, Justice White, no one of these cases takes the position that whether or not the materials seized are obscene is significant."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.691,2262.991,Yes.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2262.991,2275.61,"And in this particular case, the state maintains that once there is an adjudication of obscenity, then it becomes a proportionality question because of 39 prior convictions, each conviction carries a year sentence."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.005,2290.8,"Yes, but I thought... I thought the remedy was seizure of the proceeds of the violation."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2290.8,2306.108,"--The Indiana and Federal Racketeering laws, it's the position of the respondents, allow seizure of proceeds and also seizure of other assets if they are derived from a criminal activity to wit--"
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.108,2309.26,"Yes, if they are derived from a criminal activity."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2321.919,2323.999,"--Yes, Justice White."
1988.87-470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.011,2330.635,"So, that's a state statutory construction problem in the first instance, I suppose."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2330.635,2341.123,"In the trial court, just because there is a sanction allowed statutorily for a crime doesn't mean that the maximum is automatically going to be imposed."
1988.87-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.123,2341.882,I agree with that.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2365.277,2366.519,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.483,2389.794,You're getting me confused now.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2396.479,2397.59,--That's the state's position.
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.59,2397.999,You said that.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2409.598,2413.819,There has to be a nexus between what you're trying to forfeit--
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.819,2414.741,"Oh, of course."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2414.741,2418.431,--and what you have previously convicted for or judged.
1988.87-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.479,2427.588,What is the nexus?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2430.5,2432.563,--The people would need to be same.
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.786,2442.427,Yes.
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2468.815,2469.336,Yes.
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2469.336,2478.111,"And, therefore, everything in the store is automatically subject to forfeiture because the whole store is a criminal activity by reason of the fact that the two obscene books were sold there."
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2479.463,2480.162,It does.
1988.87-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.091,2503.379,But how can there be a proportionality problem if under the RICO statute the pattern of activity is satisfied by the sales of two or three items which are part of the ongoing business?
1988.87-470,1,41381,stephen_goldsmith,,2508.161,2508.832,--It does.
1988.87-470,2,33536,john_m_weston,,3424.647,0.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
