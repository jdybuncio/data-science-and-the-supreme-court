1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,52.981,56.999,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,243.199,244.593,Did you say page 16?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,244.593,246.152,Seven of our reply briefs.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,423.858,426.047,Nothing unique about that in public enterprise?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,426.047,427.389,No sir.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,427.389,431.01,You are right and it still goes on and will.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,431.01,450.346,"Now, with this deficit, looking the investors in the face, a new deficit, a completely different concept of $5 Million to $6 Million, we are told with that Austin Toven went out and beat up investment consent."
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.042,467.829,Excuse me Mr. Milburn.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,470.9,471.349,No sir.
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.855,741.169,"Mr. Milburn, has the covenant been repealed by New York too?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,741.169,741.404,Yes.
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.452,743.447,"Whole State, is it?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,743.447,744.693,"By a State action, yes, sir."
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.976,753.366,Was the New York repeal was litigated in the New York Court?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,753.366,754.531,It has been litigated.
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.531,755.932,"I see, that’s still not --"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,755.932,774.046,"There’s been a complaint and an answer, and a lot of papers prepared, but if you ask me why we haven’t proceeded immediately, I'll give you the answer; we were waiting for the Flushing Bank case to come down from the Court of Appeals of New York."
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,783.645,786.006,What’s the issue there Mr. Milburn?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,786.006,787.694,Big Mack.
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.618,789.953,Yes.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,789.953,794.797,New York notes it were extended and somebody sued and --
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,794.797,795.304,Yes.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,795.304,797.839,-- it’s before the Court of Appeals of New York.
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,797.839,801.142,What's the (Inaudible) support authority about it?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,804.838,809.506,The effect on the market was for a period of eight months.
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,826.98,828.979,A leveling off at what?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,828.979,831.81,At about the same as same spread.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.34,905.092,Even with respect to its own obligation?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,905.092,908.356,"Even if -- well, in this -- may I say this."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.448,932.389,You could have a few more facts and just describe this case.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,932.389,933.524,"I almost did, I think sir."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.524,934.352,That’s not what I thought.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,934.352,935.326,I may have misled --
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.326,947.707,Even -- you wouldn’t say there’s any per se rule against a State exercising its police powers with respect to its own obligation?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,947.707,948.838,Per se no.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.201,959.611,What you think of this case is a --
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,959.611,960.499,This case I think is --
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.499,967.31,-- is distinguishable from any cases that approve the modifications such as El Paso?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,967.31,971.332,I do sir and if a -- would you like to discuss El Paso?
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.332,971.736,No.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,971.736,972.958,I wish you will hear bring it alive.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.958,974.162,You’ve gone by along there.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,974.162,977.043,"We’re going to discuss El Paso, Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-1687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.043,990.007,"Mr. Milburn, we don’t need -- the creditors know but how long is Holland Tunnel been paid for? Did you make agreement on that that if it were paid for it, it would be free?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,990.007,991.767,"[Laughter] No, sir."
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1047.646,1050.936,Do you mean something like the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1050.936,1051.826,"This was it, sir."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.713,1222.898,What did they talk about?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1222.898,1224.004,Nothing.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.004,1226.52,"Well, they must have -- this wasn’t just a focus thing."
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1227.653,1233.18,"As far as -- as far as the record shows, Mr. Justice White, it was completely focused."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.532,1239.949,You would like to -- I know you would like to say they’re -- it was that and they would like say there was an emergency.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1239.949,1241.166,That is exactly right.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.166,1241.831,But the --
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1241.831,1242.152,But I don’t what would made --
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.152,1243.432,Is there any evidence at all?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1243.432,1246.17,No.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.88,1273.331,"Or perhaps, at the minimum you could say their object was to achieve what the repeal of the covenant would achieve, which was what?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1273.331,1279.635,"They, as far as we know, the object was to put the Port Authority in the Mass Transit."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.635,1280.316,"Well, that’s a --"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1280.316,1288.296,And the Mass Transit is going to -- someday it's going to have an effect on environment and it's going to have an effect on energy.
1976.75-1687,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1288.296,1291.48,Do you say Mr. Milburn to put the Port Authority in the Mass Transit?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1291.48,1292.783,"Well, let’s reverse that."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.743,1300.8,With the covenant that they could --Mass Transit would mean more deficits and the covenant would prevent more deficits?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1300.8,1301.561,Absolutely.
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.561,1302.871,And the --
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1302.871,1304.704,The covenant basis had no more error.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.885,1319.892,So was there an emergency about Mass Transit?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1322.612,1332.036,"Well, I can go back to 1921 if you like and come all the way through, there’s always been an emergency -- well, why is that word because I don’t think it’s apt, it’s -- it’s chronic situation."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.777,1339.944,And it’s precisely the object of the covenant?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1339.944,1340.636,Precisely.
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.636,1341.134,Yes.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1341.134,1349.28,Was to stop it and -- and to get the investors to put the money in to buy H & M which is Mass Transit and it is a beautiful piece of Mass Transit they --
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.28,1355.376,"The covenant said this is one emergency that we won’t take care of on the Port Authority, that’s what the covenant said?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1355.376,1356.186,Comes with what?
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.186,1364.672,"If you call Mass Transit as an emergency, you can say that the covenant said this is one emergency that Port Authority won’t take care of?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1364.672,1367.015,"If you call it an emergency, yes."
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.087,1449.959,"Well, suppose that you don’t -- suppose you just don’t go at it by labels and you just say that the real inquiry is the significance of the interest of the State in achieving what they’re trying to achieve by the repeal of the covenant?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1449.959,1454.346,If you say that that is the interest of the State --
1976.75-1687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.346,1462.638,"Say that instead of calling it an emergency or instead of asking where there is an emergency, shouldn’t you ask how important the interest of that state that seem to justify the action?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1462.638,1470.277,I think you can ask how important the interest of the State is and the interest of the State in Mass Transit is extraordinarily important.
1976.75-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.436,1558.376,"Mr. Milburn before you use all your time, be sure to discuss El Paso, the El Paso case?"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1558.376,1565.477,I was going to ask the time to rebut but the let me discuss El Paso and may be I --
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.477,1569.882,"I think in the circumstances which will enlarge the time of each side five minutes, so that --"
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1569.882,1570.064,Thank you.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.064,1570.607,You take that into account.
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1570.607,1572.919,Thank you sir.
1976.75-1687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.239,1654.791,Why do you call his interest an unbargained for one?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1654.791,1656.7,He bought the land.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.074,1766.509,Do you want to save -- how much do you want to save for rebuttal?
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1766.509,1768.835,"Well, I’d like to save what I have left."
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.166,1774.298,"So, you may reserve that for now."
1976.75-1687,0,21214,devereux_milburn,,1774.298,1784.776,Thank you.
1976.75-1687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.776,1785.605,Mr. Sovern.
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1785.605,1789.207,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1976.75-1687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.997,1840.506,"Did you have any express, are there any express assurances there about the malodorous factors?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1840.506,1840.65,As the way that it --
1976.75-1687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.65,1845.61,Or just so that it was an incident of running a slaughter house in those days?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1845.61,1848.14,That was the basis on which the police power was asserted.
1976.75-1687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.14,1854.2,"Yes I know, but was there any grant?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1862.125,1867.014,"In that case, Your Honor, the repeal did not involve their losing the right to continue."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.161,1933.104,"Mr. Sovern, how does the repealer of the 1962 covenant could change the air quality in New Jersey?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1933.104,1938.28,"The covenant does two things, Your Honor, that it is critical to correct."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.855,1979.013,Is the only method of limiting the number vehicles across the bridge to increase the fare?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1979.013,1979.719,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.784,1982.187,"That would be the only consequence in terms of air quality, wouldn’t it?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,1982.187,1988.557,"Well, there are many other methods at least some of which would be far more destructive of the bondholders’ interest without --"
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.557,2001.703,"Well, are there other methods of -- just if you concentrate in a one feature limiting the amount of traffic coming across the bridge, are there any ways that that could be done without tampering at all with the New York Port Authority, with the bondholder structure?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2001.703,2003.029,Ah.
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.029,2005.037,Could you close the bridge for a couple of hours a day?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2005.037,2006.184,You could Your Honor.
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.054,2087.224,Is there any evidence of an attempt to get more limited change in the terms of the bond in venture to just permit that change without repealing the entire covenant?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2087.224,2092.549,"The difficulty, Your Honor is that the covenant is absolutely categorical and --"
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.549,2095.708,"Does it have a procedure for getting consent to changes, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2095.708,2096.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.025,2101.344,You don’t think the bondholders would have consented to permission to increase the toll?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2101.344,2103.436,"Unquestionably not, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.764,2133.896,Did that change -- ?
1976.75-1687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.896,2135.737,And who is Mr. Thompson?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2135.737,2140.609,Mr. Thompson was plaintiff’s witness called to discuss this question among others.
1976.75-1687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2140.609,2141.941,What is his expertise?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2142.377,2148.769,"Oh, he said he was presented as an expert on the bond market, the rights of bondholders and the behavior of the investment community."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.769,2155.691,"But was the change he was discussing, one that would permit investment in the Mass Transit or merely a change in the toll?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2160.464,2163.178,"Well, I'm not clear Your Honor."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.04,2183.535,Was the reason -- let me just tie it.
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2211.137,2212.358,"I think not, Your Honor."
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.523,2268.175,"In other words, still raising cap would be a device for cutting down on air pollution then?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2268.175,2268.271,It --
1976.75-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.271,2269.748,-- which I thought you were saying was the reason for this --
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2269.748,2273.093,"It can as part of a package,Your Honor, that’s the point."
1976.75-1687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.895,2354.289,Is it possible Mr. Sovern that closing the bridges down and doing some of these other things that were suggested by Justice Stevens were politically unpalatable?
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2354.289,2358.589,"Well, there's no question about that Your Honor that neither legislature --"
1976.75-1687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.589,2365.709,"The voices of those people would be heard more widely than the voices of the bondholders in the public arena, wouldn’t they?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2365.709,2369.067,"Well, the different -- yes, there's no question about it."
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.87,2453.278,"Mr. Sovern, couldn’t the States have provided that if the authority was to go in Mass Transit, you could go into it as a separate operation in the sense that its other revenues and its other assets would not be subject to a lien of any losses in Mass Transit and couldn’t the State have otherwise underwritten those losses, rather than expose the bondholders who have the right to a revenues and other operations?"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2453.278,2457.37,"Well, let me say two things about that Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.853,2468.558,"Isn’t it historically, didn’t -- in the beginning didn’t they used to -- in the Port Authority in the early days specialized in bonds."
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2472.108,2475.314,"In the very earliest days, the bonds were a single project."
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.314,2476.373,"Yes, the bonds."
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2476.373,2478.553,But they failed and that’s why this --
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.553,2493.141,"I understand that but nevertheless, if the State had wanted to commit there own credit than that of the Port Authorities, they could have had the Port Authority to go into Mass Transit as a separate, single venture."
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2493.141,2500.861,There is no project of the Port Authority for which it would have been possible to sell bonds if it were not supported by the others.
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.861,2502.729,Unless the States themselves --
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2502.729,2504.289,Unless the States guarantee.
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.864,2506.768,"Well, that's what I'm asking you."
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2514.923,2516.784,I’m afraid to say it wasn’t feasible and it is --
1976.75-1687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.784,2520.648,"It wasn’t feasible, but it was less intrusive as far as the bondholders --"
1976.75-1687,1,36740,michael_i_sovern,,2520.648,2524.196,No question that the bondholders would’ve been happier had the States done it that way.
1976.75-1687,2,21214,devereux_milburn,,3910.634,3913.358,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1687,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4166.703,4167.352,Thank you gentlemen.
