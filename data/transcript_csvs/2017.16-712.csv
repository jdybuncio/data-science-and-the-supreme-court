2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.4,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case Number 16-712, Oil States Energy Services versus Greene's Energy Group. Ms. Ho."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,10.4,22.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 400 years, courts have adjudicated disputes between private parties about the validity of patents."
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.6,86.32,"Ms. Ho, you outlined your position, but there must be some means by which the Patent Office can correct the errors that it's made, like missing prior art that would be preclusive. So, do you recognize any error correction mechanism as within Article III?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,86.32,88.04,"Yes, certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.04,115.36,But your brief wasn't clear on that.
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,128.64,131.48,"Yes, ex -- ex parte reexaminational -- reexamination --"
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,131.48,133.44,What about inter partes reexamination?
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,133.44,141.2,"I think inter partes reexamination presents a closer case, but it is still fundamentally examinational."
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,153.44,154.16,Could you --
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,154.16,155.76,And that distinguishes us --
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,155.76,160.04,Could you review for me what you mean by examinational?
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,160.04,160.84,Certainly.
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,176.8,189.2,"But it's one, I suppose, in which anybody can participate? In other words, including the person alleging infringement or the person challenging the grant of the patent?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,189.2,193.12,Not with respect to -- with -- with respect to -- I think that's a fundamental difference.
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,221.2,221.56,But I thought --
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,221.56,226.56,"I'm sorry, there is always inherent a burden of -- of -- of production."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,255.68,256.68,"Certainly, Justice --"
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,256.68,265.24,Both of them are just informing the PTO of the nature of its error and giving it an opportunity to correct its error.
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,265.24,283.56,"I think the fundamental difference -- which is that I think the -- why the -- the government itself has referred to inter partes reexam as -- as adjudicational, is it is -- it is initiated by the third party and the third party actually prosecutes that proceeding. It is deciding a cause between the patent owner --"
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,283.56,309.64,"Well, not quite, because under the rules, if the third party settles with the patent owner, the PTO can still continue the action, can still decide the question, can still participate on appeal. So it is a public issue that is being litigated or discussed or adjudicated, so isn't that quite different than a normal adjudication?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,309.64,310.96,"I -- I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.8,357.04,"But in -- in your -- in your brief, you said if the parties settle, the PTO can't go on."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,359.96,377.4,"Well, I believe what we did was we -- we -- we quoted the statute, which says it -- it can -- its preference is to settle, or it may proceed -- it may proceed to final written -- written decision. And we've -- again, we've located only four times when the PTO has -- PTAB has done that."
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.76,419.68,"If this is a private right, as you claim, what does it matter in terms of whether the process is adjudicatory or not? If I own something, which is what your basic position, I understand, is, that this is a personal right, how can a government agency take that right away without due process of law at all? Isn't that the whole idea of Article III, that only a court can adjudicate that issue?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,419.68,460.0,"I think I would say, Justice Sotomayor, your -- it -- in terms of -- of matters that have been adjudicated traditionally in courts, over -- between private parties over -- over private rights, I think this Court's cases have established a baseline where those matters -- Article III vests those matters in Article III courts. At the same time, this Court's cases have recognized narrow exceptions, where public rights, as distinct from private rights, are at issue, where Article III does not require that those rights be vested, the decisions of those rights --"
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.0,473.92,"Just to examine public rights, could Congress say -- let's hypothesize going forward -- that we will grant you a patent on the condition that you agree to this procedure; otherwise, we don't give you the patent."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,476.0,497.4,"No, for -- for two reasons. First, we believe that would be an unconstitutional condition, so that Congress cannot condition the exercise of a right or a property or benefit of -- of any sort, to the extent that doing so would -- would conflict with another article of the -- of the Constitution."
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.4,497.48,What --
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,497.48,498.4,"So, for example -- yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.4,504.92,"What's your closest case for that? Not Crowell versus Benson, that doesn't quite work."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,504.92,515.64,"I think -- I think, perhaps -- I think, perhaps our -- our closest case to that might be Northern Pipeline or maybe one of the bankruptcy cases --"
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.64,515.84,I --
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,515.84,526.52,-- where even -- even -- even the fact that Congress had recognized -- had said that it's permissible for -- for these rights to be adjudicated in an Article III court.
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.76,542.4,"But -- but Congress didn't create the right in Stern, so that's quite distinguished. Let me ask you this, it's a basic question -- patent lawyers would probably know the answer."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,548.84,554.6,"Yes, I think that would -- that -- that goes to the limited times requirement in Congress that this Court doesn't --"
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,554.6,563.88,"Well, then that -- doesn't that show that the patent owner has limited expectations as to the scope and the validity of the property right that he holds?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,563.88,589.96,"No, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think the limited times requirement, which is the Article I, Section 8 requirement, I don't think that goes to whether Congress could, by statute, withdraw the adjudication of disputes that have been adjudicated in courts for centuries, could withdraw those cases and put them in a non-Article III tribunal. Again --"
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,589.96,632.56,"What is -- what is the relationship between your position and the takings clause? The government can certainly diminish the value of your property rights quite extensively when it comes up with new -- new regulation. You have a lot that you think you could have built a mansion on, and then the government passes a law and you can only build a shed on it and -- and yet we often say -- or give the government a lot of leeway in saying that -- that they don't have to pay compensation. So, if the government can restrict your property right in real property to that extent, why can't it do so with respect to patent rights?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,632.56,697.76,"And I think the fundamental difference there, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of -- of -- of takings and due process, which we haven't advanced arguments about, and Article III, which is really focused on the exercise of the judicial power, and it has really two components. It has the component that is directed toward the individual rights guarantee, so the guarantee of litigants to impartial decision-makers and at the same time at the structural protections, the checks and balances protections that protect the -- the judicial integrity. So I think the difference here is that when Congress -- and certainly individual rights are at stake when the government takes property that belongs to one person for a public use and doesn't pay just compensation. But I think, in the Article III context, where Congress is taking a category of cases that have been adjudicated in courts for centuries and removes those cases -- withdraws those cases to a non-Article III tribunal, that impacts not only the individual rights guarantees that Article III does --"
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.76,704.64,"But for a very limited purpose, for the purpose of determining whether -- it's not a duplication of an infringement action."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,723.64,792.16,"Several points to that, that -- Justice Ginsburg, you're absolutely correct that the grounds are under sections 102 and 103 novelty and non-obviousness with respect to prior art. Even if that were narrow, I think this Court has said that it's no more permissible for Congress to -- to kind of nibble around the edges, as opposed to a wholesale transfer, but even so, here, setting aside that those two areas of novelty and obviousness make up about 60 percent of the patent validity challenges in the district courts, the estoppel provisions provide that, in the 80 percent of cases, in 80 percent of inter partes reviews, those proceedings are taking place with concurrent district court litigation. So, if in those cases, if in the IPR the patent holder wins, then the -- the claims of the patent are canceled and the patent -- the challenger goes into the district court and says the action is moot -- the infringement action is moot."
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,792.16,792.92,So -- I'm sorry.
2017.16-712,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,792.92,809.92,"Ms. -- Ms. Ho, we have a number of cases that have arguably addressed this issue already, like McCormick, for example, in which this Court said the only authority competent to set a patent aside or to annul it or to correct it for any reason whatever is vested in the courts of the United States."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,828.68,834.4,"So our reading of those cases, particularly McCormick, is they are constitutional."
2017.16-712,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,843.48,846.2,"Why is your reading that they're constitutional, if you could help me with that?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,846.2,846.96,Certainly.
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.24,914.64,"Ms. Ho, I'm sorry, I thought in McCormick, that -- why did the Court even bother looking at the statute? What it did, I understood, was look at the statute and say the statute basically defines the issue of a new patent being issued as one -- before the old patent expires. And so they were really doing a statutory analysis of whether or not, by that process, the old patent was expired, and they were saying, no, if you want it to expire now, you have to go to court, because there's no statutory authority for doing it currently. So I'm not quite sure how -- how you get to the constitutional holding."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,914.64,929.64,"I -- I think how we -- how we get to the constitutional holding, Your Honor, is that there was, at that time, there -- there -- there was another statute in play that would have -- would have permitted the -- the -- the -- the cancellation."
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,941.6,945.12,It's certainly true that it didn't refer to that other statute either.
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,945.12,945.48,I --
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,945.48,945.92,Ms. Ho --
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,945.92,946.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,946.36,950.28,-- can I -- can I take you back to this question of where you would draw the line --
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,950.28,950.92,Yes.
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,950.92,991.68,"-- between ex parte and inter partes reexamination on the one hand and this? Because, as I understand what you would permit, those proceedings too can be initiated by a third party -- you know, can be at the request of a third party, and -- and those -- in those proceedings too, the third party can participate in some way, can file a reply to the patentee's statement, can make known its views. So what's the line? Where would you -- what are the procedures that are here that you think make this essentially adjudicatory that are not in those other proceedings?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,991.68,993.08,Certainly.
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1017.92,1019.56,"Well, I didn't say they fall out."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1023.52,1024.12,Certainly.
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.12,1031.08,"So what is it? Is it discovery? Is it -- is it participation in the hearing? I mean, I just want to ground this in something."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1031.08,1031.76,Yes.
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1042.4,1048.44,"But what -- what's the most that the government could do, do you think?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1048.44,1049.0,The --
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1049.0,1057.2,"You know, what's the -- what are the -- how many of these things do you have to take away before you have a constitutional system?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1057.2,1074.84,"I think -- I think, fundamentally, an adjudication, an exercise of the judicial power -- and one reason we know it in this case is because it simply has taken a category of cases out and put it into the tribunal, but I think hearing and deciding a cause between two private parties that results -- that results in a -- in a final binding judgment."
2017.16-712,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.84,1083.56,"It would be like if the airlines loses your umbrella, for example, and the CAB used to say, you go to the CAB, you complain, they lost my umbrella."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1087.8,1088.16,"No, Your Honor, the --"
2017.16-712,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.16,1090.32,"By the way, there was judicial review."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1090.32,1090.56,I -- JUSTICE BREYER.
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1133.08,1133.16,To --
2017.16-712,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.16,1136.92,-- or do you want to say it isn't special and all the agency proceedings are unlawful?
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1136.92,1137.0,It --
2017.16-712,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.0,1140.16,"Because a lot of them would fit the definition, I think, that you propose."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1140.16,1163.2,"Let me -- let me -- let me begin with -- with your last -- your last question, Justice Breyer. I don't think that invalidating IPR would affect these, for the fundamental reason that in virtually -- virtually all truly administrative adjudications, those are between the government as -- as -- as the enforcer."
2017.16-712,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.2,1174.88,"You could have -- is an airline the government? Is a trucking company the government? Is a utility, electricity company or a natural gas company, the government?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1174.88,1186.2,"In the vast -- in the vast majority of administrative adjudications, it is -- it is the government, or those proceedings are acting as a permissible adjunct to the district court."
2017.16-712,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1186.2,1190.12,"Well, one understanding of this, Ms. Ho, is that this is the government in a real sense."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1235.44,1236.84,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1271.52,1271.96,"Well, to ask you --"
2017.16-712,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1271.96,1286.52,"Why not -- why not, though, Ms. Ho, just simply say the question is whether there's a private right involved? In answering Justice Kagan's questions and Justice Breyer's questions, you struggled with how much of an adjudication does an inquisitorial process have to have before it becomes an adjudication."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1300.32,1308.72,"In large measure, Justice Gorsuch, because of several -- in several of this Court's cases, in Schor, for example, in Providence --"
2017.16-712,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1308.72,1312.08,Schor is about the line between public and private rights.
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1315.56,1318.16,We certainly do stake our ground on that it's a private right.
2017.16-712,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1322.52,1323.24,But then you -- but then you --
2017.16-712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1323.24,1331.4,"Well, suppose -- suppose that Congress had included inter partes review in the Patent Act of 1790."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1335.72,1346.2,"Yes, we would, because even in -- even in -- in 1790, Your Honor, there would still be a 200-year history of these rights being adjudicated in -- in courts -- in courts at all."
2017.16-712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1346.2,1352.52,"But you think Congress was under an obligation to create the patent system, a constitutional obligation to do it?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1352.52,1354.24,"No, we don't."
2017.16-712,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1354.24,1361.92,"So could it do it subject to the -- grant these monopolies, subject to this limitation?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1361.92,1369.88,I think there are any number of ways that Congress could certainly permissibly condition a grant on -- of a patent.
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1379.4,1416.64,"So is your -- is your position that somehow at the founding in 1789, given the replete English history of the Crown and the Privy Council sidestepping -- sidestepping any judicial adjudication of validity, that in 1789 the founders intended to change that system as radically as to say, no, we're not going to permit either the legislature -- the legislature to change the terms of a patent grant?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1416.64,1438.48,"The way I would respond, Your Honor, I think with respect to the history, I think the history here is very strong that at -- certainly, at the time of the founding and for centuries before, that English courts at law, this was precisely -- this wasn't just the stuff that was decided in the -- in the courts at Westminster in 1789 were those proceedings."
2017.16-712,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1438.48,1458.52,"Your amici -- your strongest amici says that it had waned, the Privy Council's adjudications had waned over time and that they could only find 10 times over a 20-year period preceding 1789 in which the Privy Council had acted."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1468.8,1471.24,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I believe that it did."
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.52,1514.24,Who -- who grant -- who granted the patent in -- way back in 1787 -- 1789? Who granted the patent?
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1514.24,1519.24,"Who granted? It would have -- in England, it would have come -- it would have come from -- from the Crown, according to --"
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.24,1522.6,"And was it subject to findings about novelty, non-obviousness?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1522.6,1526.92,"Yes, it absolutely was, and in -- in disputes between --"
2017.16-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1526.92,1529.16,"Was that statutory, or was that just the custom?"
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1529.16,1535.24,"Well, the statute of monopolies in 1624 referred to that the validity of patents should be decided as at common law."
2017.16-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.68,1549.88,And the king couldn't say I made a mistake?
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1549.88,1556.76,"Well, the statute of monopolies in 1624 said the validity of a patent should be decided at common law."
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.64,1572.0,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-712,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1572.0,1576.88,Thank you.
2017.16-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.88,1579.36,Mr. Kise.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1579.36,1622.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: IPR, inter partes review, comports with both Article III and the Seventh Amendment for at least the following three reasons: First, inter partes review simply reexamines the propriety of the original grant of a patent, engaging in the same type of patentability analysis entrusted by Congress to the executive since 1790. The process itself is not inherently judicial, and it does not involve the exercise of the judicial power. Next, inter partes review does not extinguish, in the language of the question presented, private property rights."
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1640.36,1664.8,"You at some point -- I mean, what I've wondered as I've read this is -- suppose that just what you say happens, with that all we're doing is reexamining the patent and the statute provides it, but suppose that the patent has been in existence without anybody reexamining it for 10 years and, moreover, the company's invested $40 billion in developing it."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1680.44,1684.24,"I -- I don't think so, respectfully, Justice Breyer, and here's why."
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.24,1686.68,Fifteen years?
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1686.68,1688.24,I don't know that the timeline --
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1688.24,1691.72,"Thirty? Everybody -- I don't know how long they last, but, you know, they --"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1691.72,1691.92,Well --
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.92,1693.32,-- some lasted a long time.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1693.32,1708.52,"Respectfully, I don't think that it -- it matters, certainly not constitutionally, but -- but -- but even in the structure of the -- of the patent statute -- the patent scheme that's been created by Congress. Congress established certain patentability criteria that need be met, and all patents are taken --"
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.52,1713.84,"Everybody's dead, by the way, who actually knows about the original article written in Danish, that -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.84,1720.36,-- nobody found except this one guy who happens to be sued for infringement.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1720.36,1724.56,All patents are taken subject to these patentability standards.
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.56,1744.0,"Yes, but I'm just saying can it be anything? Can it be anything at all where you're going to re -- do people gain a kind of vested interest or right after enough time goes by and they rely on it sufficiently so that it now becomes what?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1744.0,1744.04,I -- I --
2017.16-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.04,1758.84,Is there something in the Constitution that protects a person after a long period of time and much reliance from a reexamination at a time where much of the evidence will have disappeared?
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1758.84,1761.4,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I -- I would say no, because --"
2017.16-712,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1761.4,1761.84,"Well, here is --"
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.84,1762.24,I understood --
2017.16-712,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1762.24,1766.32,-- how about -- how about if there were no judicial review at all?
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1766.32,1770.08,"Well, I think, if there were no judicial review at all, that presents a different question."
2017.16-712,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1770.08,1770.28,Yes.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1772.32,1780.56,"Well, I -- I don't know that I would have to say yes because we're still talking about a patentability determination that's being made by the executive branch."
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.4,1796.12,"So your -- your position, it strikes me, is simply that you've got to take the bitter with the sweet. If you want the sweet of having a patent, you've got to take the bitter that the government might reevaluate it at some subsequent point."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1796.12,1797.52,"Yes -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.52,1804.24,"Well, haven't our cases rejected that -- that proposition? I'm thinking of the public employment cases, the welfare benefits cases."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1812.88,1816.44,"I -- I don't think, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, this is inconsistent with due process."
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.32,1861.2,"What about -- in terms of due process anyway, what about this business -- and maybe it's in the Petitioner's brief, that the commissioner can change the -- the panels if she doesn't agree with the direction they're going, that she can add new judges to the panel so that they'll -- in other words, it's a -- the panel itself -- and I think constitutionally this may be fine, is -- is a tool of the executive activity, rather than something involving some -- anything resembling a determination of rights?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1861.2,1879.08,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the panel packing, if you will, mentioned by Petitioner in the briefs, I don't believe -- and -- and I'll leave it to the government to -- to have the exact statistics -- precise statistics, but I don't believe that that's taken place more than one or two times, and I don't believe it's taken place with respect --"
2017.16-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.08,1881.12,"Well, suppose it were rampant."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1881.12,1901.76,"Well, if it were rampant, then I think what this Court said in Cuozzo, that -- that was written, that the -- the shenanigans point, if you will, that the Administrative Procedures Act and other provisions of the Constitution would deal with infirmities in a particular case on an as-applied basis, but I don't think that the -- the potential for there to be mischief afoot --"
2017.16-712,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1901.76,1911.0,"That -- that was what troubled me deeply about you telling Justice Kagan that, without judicial review, that this would be adequate."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1938.76,1942.36,"Justice Sotomayor, I did not mean to imply that -- that there is unfettered discretion."
2017.16-712,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.16,1948.32,"Well, that's what you're saying because, without judicial review, how -- what else is it?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1948.32,1951.04,"No, I think with respect to this process there is judicial review."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1951.04,1954.2,"Well, now, counsel, there's only judicial review if somebody appeals."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1978.2,1979.2,Well --
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1979.2,1980.32,Did I miss something?
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1980.32,1981.44,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1985.6,1988.64,"If somebody takes review, but if not, it -- it's binding, right?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1988.64,1993.0,"Well, I think that would be true with respect to any -- even in the original examination process."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1993.16,1996.16,"Well, it's not true with respect to magistrate judges or anything like that."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2003.88,2005.68,"No, Your Honor, because I -- this is a different structure."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2006.52,2007.72,"It is a different structure, yes."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2007.72,2011.92,It is because it's the same patentability determination that's made during the original examination process.
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2011.92,2032.76,"Do you think it would work if -- if we had land patents subject to the same circumstances, that they could be reexamined at any time over hundreds of years, even after the farmer had sold the land to the developer who built the houses and that the land patent could be revoked by the government, by bureaucracy, I suppose, in the Department of Interior?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2032.76,2033.64,I think that there is --
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2033.64,2038.12,"But, that it is subject to packing by a director who's unhappy with the results?"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2038.12,2046.56,"There's a fundamental distinction between -- respectfully, between land patents which -- which grant fee-simple title to the holder and an invention patent."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2046.56,2047.36,A monopoly in the use of land.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2052.2,2059.28,"Well, one is -- one is -- one is -- is a core fundamental right, to borrow the -- the expressions of the court, it's more of a Lockean interest, it's a fundamental right."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2060.16,2064.88,Isn't that question begging about what's a private right? Isn't that the very question this Court has to decide?
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2064.88,2085.28,"Respectfully, as I began, I don't believe that the Court does need to decide it because this is an executive adjudication, but to the extent the Court looks to those factors, I think under -- under almost any test the Court has established, we -- we have a right that derives solely from and depends solely on a federal statute. There are no common law antecedents. The Petitioner has not disputed that."
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2112.16,2117.96,"Fair -- fair enough, when it's -- when it's granted, but once it's granted, there's an abundance of law going back 400 years."
2017.16-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.32,2139.72,That -- and that's the -- that's the constitutional provision.
2017.16-712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2139.72,2140.24,Yeah.
2017.16-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.24,2147.0,"Securing for limited times authors and inventors the exclusive right, securing to them, not securing to the public --"
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2147.0,2154.36,"But -- but those cases were decided, first of all, as -- as -- as the discussion earlier revealed, they were decided on a statutory basis."
2017.16-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2161.68,2167.12,I think Ms. Ho conceded that there can be an examination -- reexamination.
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2192.52,2199.32,"May I respond, Mr. Chief Justice? Justice Ginsburg, what you're hearing from the Petitioner is a process versus power argument."
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2227.56,2228.4,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-712,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2228.4,2239.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2239.12,2240.4,Mr. Stewart.
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3442.68,3446.84,"Thank you, Your Honor. Three quick points."
2017.16-712,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3484.4,3488.56,Wouldn't that be an obvious due process flaw?
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3488.56,3493.96,"I -- I would have thought in a case where it happens, it would have been an obvious due process flaw."
2017.16-712,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3514.36,3524.6,But I think the government has conceded that due process has to be a check on administrative agency adjudications as well as court adjudications.
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3524.6,3527.44,"And we certainly -- we certainly don't disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-712,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3545.12,3550.12,They're the same people that -- that grant the patent in the first place.
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3556.04,3556.52,No.
2017.16-712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3640.16,3652.92,"I guess the Federal Communications Commission, at least as they used to have it, where a citizen could come in and say I want you to take away the franchise of KPIX, sounds to me as if you've described it perfectly."
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3655.0,3655.6,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3684.36,3685.84,"Well, if I could just --"
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3685.84,3686.12,"Oh, yes."
2017.16-712,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3686.12,3690.2,"-- I mean, because there are formal adjudications all over the place in agencies."
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3701.16,3702.76,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2017.16-712,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3703.12,3703.72,Go ahead.
2017.16-712,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3703.72,3742.84,"I think the big difference there is at the NLRB, it is the general counsel, it is the general counsel of the NLRB, it is the government, that is bringing that action and that is prosecuting that action. So you're -- you're right there. There -- I think there is some confusion in terms of adjudication for rule-making purposes, which is the government prosecuting the action and choosing that, in opposed to rule-making, which we're not challenging. Our challenge is to an adjudication in the Article III sense between two private parties, where the government isn't -- isn't engaging in the classic executive action of bringing the action or prosecuting action but is adjudicating, is the decider of the action."
