1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.336,"umber 329, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus Cabot Carbon Company and Cabot Shops, Inc."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,29.639,31.796,May it please the Court.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.082,1069.267,"Well, how far does this go Mr. McDermott?"
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1080.384,1090.696,Committees such as this could exist to discuss -- they could -- they could exist to discuss grievances in working conditions.
1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1102.133,1109.91,I take it Mr. McDermott's of your -- your position is that the -- the employees could do anything they wanted in that -- in that line --
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1109.91,1111.056,"That's right, absent to the --"
1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1111.056,1114.987,"-- to the committee, as long as they're not -- dominate in any way by the employer."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1114.987,1118.248,"That's right, in an absence -- the presence of a majority representative."
1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1118.248,1119.291,"Yes, yes."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1119.291,1120.146,Definitely.
1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1120.146,1120.292,Yes.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1120.292,1127.293,Well -- well then we're not to be concerned here with the matters discussed but rather with how the committees were composed?
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1127.293,1128.281,"Well, no."
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.749,1160.691,"Well, stop right there."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1160.691,1161.155,Yes.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.155,1165.186,Would you say would be quite proper provided they were not dominated.
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1165.186,1166.428,Provided they were not dominated.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1166.428,1169.142,Well then does that get down to how they were selected?
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1171.132,1187.514,"Well, the -- if I may point out first, that question is along here before for this Court because the court below agreed with the Board except to the Board's findings that these committees were dominated and the respondents do not contend otherwise."
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1254.175,1256.209,They had held they were not labor organizations?
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1256.209,1281.435,"And held they were not labor organizations, basically because the Court said the word to “deal” must mean to “bargain” or “negotiate” and it -- unless these organizations bargain collectively and I might say the Court had in mind the -- the traditional sense to negotiate a contract, formal or informal, to sit across the table and -- otherwise the union would do --"
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1281.435,1282.987,"Well, is that what the issue in this case now (Inaudible)?"
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1282.987,1287.634,The issue in this case is whether these committees are labor organizations under the Act.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1287.634,1296.871,"I mean, -- no, the -- pardon -- and is that narrowed to the question whether deal is -- means bargain?"
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1296.871,1305.487,"Well, it's narrowed to the question of whether the word “deal” as used in Section 2 (5) is coextensive with “to bargain” or “to negotiate.”"
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.293,1339.369,"As to domination, it's -- it's -- it's almost the part of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals and part of the argument of -- of respondents that these are -- that these groups were so dominated, so obviously dominated, they were creatures of the employer, that for that very reason they were not labor organization."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1339.369,1339.93,"Yes, the --"
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.93,1340.821,Is that almost the --
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1340.821,1346.318,They argued that they're not labor organizations because they never negotiated a contract or attempted to --
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.318,1346.598,Whether they were created --
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1346.598,1347.572,-- nor that --
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1347.572,1350.636,-- by the employer and sustained and carried by the employer --
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1350.636,1352.797,That's correct.
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.797,1355.504,-- for a different -- the purpose is quite different in collective bargaining --
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1355.504,1355.952,Yes.
1958.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.952,1363.392,"-- and that -- almost because of that, obvious domination, that -- that is one of the reasons that they -- they say these are not labor organizations."
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1363.392,1368.661,They proved it not to be a labor organization by the result of the domination.
1958.329,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.191,1405.356,"There is a bargaining agent here, is there not?"
1958.329,0,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,1405.356,1408.765,In -- in -- they're a total of some 18 plants.
1958.329,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1487.82,1490.523,Mr. Hillyer.
1958.329,1,27316,haywood_h_hillyer,,1490.523,1493.174,May it please the Court.
1958.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1588.505,1601.541,"Before -- before you leave that, Mr. Hillyer, did they negotiate such things as determining whether you would have plant seniority or company seniority?"
1958.329,1,27316,haywood_h_hillyer,,1601.541,1605.467,"There was no negotiation on that, Your Honor, and the record so reflects."
1958.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1650.084,1665.96,"Then were the -- were there any -- any other things that were filling the legitimate field of -- of bargaining, collective bargaining that were determined by -- by understanding between this committee and the management?"
1958.329,1,27316,haywood_h_hillyer,,1665.96,1671.365,"Your Honor, there was no understanding between the committee and management."
1958.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1671.365,1672.442,Or did they work out?
1958.329,1,27316,haywood_h_hillyer,,1672.442,1672.55,They --
1958.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1672.55,1673.159,Did they work out?
1958.329,1,27316,haywood_h_hillyer,,1673.159,1674.398,They have worked out.
1958.329,2,43000,thomas_j_mcdermott,,3087.321,3102.345,"Only one point, Your Honor, you asked the question of what -- asked the question whether in reenacting Section 2 (5) of the Wagner Act, did Congress change the definition of labor organization?"
1958.329,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3119.708,3124.489,We'll recess.
