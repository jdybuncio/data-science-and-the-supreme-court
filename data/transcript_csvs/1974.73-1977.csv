1974.73-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.916,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1977, Alyeska Pipeline against the Wilderness Society."
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,68.411,72.365,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1977,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,144.84,146.934,"What's the way you pronounce it, Alyeska?"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,146.934,147.853,Alyeska.
1974.73-1977,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,147.853,149.658,Not Alyeska?
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,149.658,152.883,"Alyeska is the correct pronunciation, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.617,341.804,Did they seek fees just for their services in the Court of Appeals or for throughout the litigation?
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,341.804,365.636,"Well, it wasn't throughout the litigation but it covered such things for example as obtaining expert comment on the environmental impact statement, they submitted four volumes of comments to the Secretary of Interior as part of the public comments, preparation of the Mineral Leasing Act brief, preparation of the briefs in connection with the NEPA issues."
1974.73-1977,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,604.355,612.493,Is there any case in this Court that is held that there is a general -- private attorney generals?
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,612.493,632.054,"There is no such case, there was a reference to the private attorney general doctrine in Newman versus Piggie Park Enterprises but that was a statutory case under Title II of the Civil Rights Act and it was more -- the Court was effectively creating a presumption in favor of attorney's fees on one of the statute there."
1974.73-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.793,999.003,"Well, Mr. Jordan how can a Court possibly decide whether or not that was or was not an important statute?"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,999.003,1006.132,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my position or our position here is that Court ought not to be doing that."
1974.73-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.726,1040.055,"Certainly, if a width statute were passed today with the environmental concerns that are apparent, I suppose one might say that it was thought to be very important that the secretary grant just so much right of way and no more."
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1040.055,1052.923,"Well, I think that that could be but I think you have to look to how Congress viewed it, not how the Courts view and you want to look for some object determination of what Congress thought about the time passed it."
1974.73-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.923,1068.516,"But you sat here during the argument of this last case, we have a hell of a time figuring out what Congress meant substantively in the statute to -- that we should go further and decide whether or not Congress thought it was important."
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1068.516,1076.902,"Well, I agree with your analysis Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I would say these, you know that you can kind to go one way or the other."
1974.73-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.138,1121.301,Of course the Civil Rights Act of ‘64 authorizes counsel fee.
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1121.301,1124.576,Some titles do such as Title II.
1974.73-1977,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1131.755,1136.161,"But this may be the third one, the general equitable powers of an equity court?"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1136.161,1144.998,"Well, the opinions of this Court have often -- attorney's fees have often made reference to that general equitable power."
1974.73-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1169.013,1190.643,"Suppose, Mr. Jordan that if we had a broad equity approach, we might then say that if someone on the posture of the wilderness society brought litigation of this kind and lost, that attorney's fees could be taxed against them, the equity power can't be one that works just one way, could it?"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1190.643,1206.504,"Well, we don't think it should work one way but that's exactly what the Court of Appeals said in his opinion and Judge Wright said, “It's okay to award the attorney's fees against Alyeska because they have such a massive interest that they couldn't possibly be deterred from bringing the litigation."
1974.73-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1212.853,1215.097,"Well, the same could be set to afford foundation."
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1228.695,1231.578,"No, it certainly will not apply to Ford Foundation but you know --"
1974.73-1977,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.578,1238.542,Do you draw a difference between a non-profit corporations and fourth foundation in people like that?
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1238.542,1239.56,I beg your pardon.
1974.73-1977,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1239.56,1246.091,"Do you draw a difference between a non-profit corporation in Alyeska, whatever it is?"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1246.091,1249.301,"Well, let's put it this way."
1974.73-1977,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.301,1253.257,"I mean there is a difference, you couldn't collect from them and they couldn't collect --"
1974.73-1977,0,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,1253.257,1258.601,"Well there maybe judgment proof Mr. Justice Marshall, that that may be a possibility."
1974.73-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1528.388,1532.116,"Very well Mr. Jordan, Mr. Flannery."
1974.73-1977,1,20861,dennis_j_flannery,,1532.116,1534.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1977,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.721,1537.314,"Mr. Flannery, has the amount of this ordinance fixed?"
1974.73-1977,1,20861,dennis_j_flannery,,1537.314,1538.246,It has not Your Honor.
1974.73-1977,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.09,1545.914,Was the hours pretty well defined?
1974.73-1977,1,20861,dennis_j_flannery,,1550.296,1551.108,"Yes, they were Your Honor."
1974.73-1977,2,39625,robert_e_jordan_iii,,3826.031,3829.753,A few further observations Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1977,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4181.064,4182.075,Thank you gentlemen.
