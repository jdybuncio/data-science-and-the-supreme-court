1962.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.749,"Number 104, New Jersey et al., Appellants, versus New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad Company."
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,37.224,45.204,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.104,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,446.182,448.936,(Inaudible)
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,448.936,457.451,"As far as I know, the Interstate Commerce Commission has authority over the bus, their intrastate bus, by a provision in the carrier's tariff."
1962.104,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,464.709,469.781,(Inaudible)
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,469.781,479.552,The Interstate Commerce Commission could approve abandonment of the buses if this carrier should file amendment to its tariff and discontinue.
1962.104,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,513.825,516.264,(Inaudible)
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,516.264,528.367,"Oh, if the train was authorized to be discontinued, all the carrier would have to do is amend this tariff and I'm sure nobody would complain then once the train was discontinued."
1962.104,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,528.367,542.388,(Inaudible)
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,542.388,576.799,"Well, no I disagree because this carrier operates these buses by virtue of a provision that has this tariff, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and if this carrier wanted to discontinue these buses, it could file and amend the tariff and if there were no objections to the amendment, I would assume that the Interstate Commerce Commission would permit the filing and that would be the end of the bus."
1962.104,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,576.799,579.107,They're not an interstate --
1962.104,0,44823,william_gural,,579.107,581.213,"It is an interstate bus, yes sir."
1962.104,1,43555,vincent_p_biunno,,1884.133,1889.831,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4007.022,4012.961,I just wanted to make an observation --
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4012.961,4032.494,What about this question Mr. Gural that Justice White and I were putting to Mr. Biunno about that -- this apparently people ride to 908 and leaves at Butler at 626 to Hackensack 721 that was the -- they couldn't care less whether you go on to Susquehanna Transfer but if they're going to lose that service.
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4032.494,4032.712,Yes.
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4035.813,4039.198,"But, I haven't -- you haven't made in the argument based on that or is there no merits --"
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4039.198,4048.241,"No, my argument is that the whole operation from Butler to Susquehanna Transfer is an intrastate operation."
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4049.269,4061.733,"Well, suppose you're wrong about that, suppose you are wrong and this is a train in that sense even though it utilizes a bus, what about the state's interest in the continuance of that intrastate service?"
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4061.733,4077.025,"Well, I'm afraid that if the Interstate Commerce Commission had permitted the discontinuance that the Interstate Commerce Commission decides that this is an interstate operation and permitted discontinuance, I'm afraid the state's ousted from jurisdiction."
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4077.941,4085.971,But whether -- but the question here is what is -- what are the respective scopes of 13a (1) and 13a (2)?
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4085.971,4088.119,"Well, I can only --"
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4088.119,4095.572,Congress says that the states may pass -- may first pass on the discontinuance of an intrastate train.
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4095.572,4096.529,"Yes, sir."
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4096.529,4098.17,Isn't it an intrastate train --
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4098.17,4098.594,That's our argument.
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4098.594,4100.846,-- after the Hackensack?
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4100.846,4103.18,In that respect although that's not the entire trip.
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4103.18,4110.252,"But you just argued that it is not an interstate claim, it hooks onto bus."
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4110.252,4111.312,"And not only that, Susquehanna Transfer --"
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4111.312,4115.417,And I don't know why you won't argue that an intrastate train no matter what it has ought to do because if --
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4115.417,4116.791,Exactly.
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4116.791,4118.638,-- because it runs to Hackensack.
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4118.638,4123.189,Or to Susquehanna Transfer which is also within New Jersey.
1962.104,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4127.832,4139.89,(Inaudible)
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4139.89,4142.411,"No, that would be an interstate train's act."
1962.104,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4143.033,4144.18,"First, second and fourth?"
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4144.18,4145.035,Yes sir.
1962.104,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4168.004,4174.133,"Mr. Gural, you can put an intrastate train in Hackensack?"
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4174.133,4180.47,"Yes sir, if we found -- if the State found public convenience and necessity required such as service, we could order -- however --"
1962.104,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4180.47,4188.192,"This train is -- if you lost here, my argue could if you get these findings within Hackensack."
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4188.192,4212.234,"No sir, because the way 13 (a) works if the Interstate Commerce Commission does not choose to investigate, they have to make up their mind within 20 days of debate with these notices to investigate and if they don't do that, those trains -- under the statute, those trains automatically go off."
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4212.234,4213.233,"Well, even though."
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4228.416,4228.924,I -- I --
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4228.924,4230.222,You disagree with them about that?
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4230.222,4235.298,"Yes sir, I must disagree because I think that the Interstate Commerce Commission at this point (Voice Overlap) by fairly --"
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4235.298,4237.04,He just had a gift times five.
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4237.04,4238.334,Well --
1962.104,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4238.334,4239.552,They wouldn't have anything to do with it.
1962.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4241.349,4252.585,It's entirely intrastate that his point was that abandonment or discontinue of this interstate train and then tomorrow you can require them to give another train service between the intrastate point.
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4252.585,4266.157,"But aren't you saying that why abandon and have it that -- then you have to set up a new docket and have a new hearing to go on the train and you said abandon meanwhile and then you have to get them to reinstitute a service, is that it?"
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4266.157,4267.22,That's -- that would be the proceeding --
1962.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4267.22,4272.794,And you would like to get (Voice Overlap) before they abandon that train from the Hackensack?
1962.104,2,44823,william_gural,,4272.794,4282.829,We would like to -- we would like to extend the hearing and explore this application before the Interstate Commerce Commission gets it.
