1982.81-2338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.746,We will hear arguments first this morning in Regan against Taxation with Representation of Washington.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,12.869,16.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.158,184.67,"Well, did the Court of Appeals use that rather obscure phrase that you just used that First Amendment rights were affected but not infringed?"
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,184.67,190.92,"Well, it first held, Justice Rehnquist, that under Cammarano they had not been violated."
1982.81-2338,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,340.498,346.354,But the Court in those cases left open a situation which I take it you are going to come to.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,346.354,357.445,"Yes, but the difference of treatment in those cases was undeniable, and the effect was on a fundamental constitutional right."
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.762,745.683,Solicitor General Lee?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,745.683,746.608,--Yes.
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.608,757.523,What if Congress instead of giving the veterans organizations a break in the tax statute had simply appropriated $5 million to each of them?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,761.133,761.851,I do not.
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.851,763.535,This really isn't much different.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,763.535,765.536,I think it is not very much different.
1982.81-2338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.547,781.465,Has not the Congress over a period of years granted a great many benefits to veterans?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,781.465,782.046,Precisely.
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.344,860.59,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I go back for a moment to your comment that there are only two differences between the abortion cases, the funding case, and this case?"
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,883.488,885.442,"Yes, and I plan to do so right now."
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.366,970.436,"Well, I suppose you say they are wealthy persons because they are rich enough to contribute to a charity, but by hypothesis, I suppose, the lobbying is for a charitable purpose which the Government recognizes is in the general public interest, or otherwise they wouldn't give them the tax exemption in the first place."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,970.436,986.041,"Yes, and in Slee, of course, the problem was attacked by defining what is meant by ""charitable"", and what Judge Han did in that case was to uphold the Government's position that it isn't really charitable if it is being used for lobbying purposes."
1982.81-2338,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1015.373,1025.633,"Well, General Lee, I suppose the Appellee can set up a separate corporation to do its lobbying and preserve the 501(c)(3) status for everything else."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1025.633,1029.633,"The Court of Appeals in fact pointed that out, and that is our understanding."
1982.81-2338,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1029.633,1030.694,Do you agree with that?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1030.694,1032.067,They can.
1982.81-2338,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1038.236,1043.423,"Wouldn't the IRS be the first to move in and say these are twin corporations, and, hence, they will lose their--"
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1043.423,1048.983,"Well, it depends on what the relationship is between them, and that's the disadvatage, Justice Blackmun, as you correctly point out."
1982.81-2338,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1064.586,1066.898,--It is certainly not so easy to answer.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1066.898,1067.615,That's right.
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.301,1080.203,"General Lee, I am not quite certain what happens to an organization, a 501(c)(3) organization, which does lobby."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1083.919,1085.093,That is correct.
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.093,1086.295,Is that correct?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1090.669,1091.776,That's right.
1982.81-2338,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1136.711,1151.44,"General Lee, one of the amicus briefs argued that there was no jurisdiction under Section 7428 to make a constitutional attack on the validity of tax statutes."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1173.198,1177.055,"It certainly can be interpreted in that way, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-2338,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1273.502,1275.187,One other question if I may.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1284.81,1287.15,"Well, I think it helps us to an extent."
1982.81-2338,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.221,1308.909,Flexibility for the First Amendment?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1308.909,1342.019,"Well, the ability of that amendment to make accommodation in the light of other policies, in this case it enforces at least Cammarano's holding that when you have an arguable effect as you do in this case on a First Amendment interest that comes about because of an income tax classification, that you judge the case as an income tax and you defer to Congress's judgment in that case."
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.983,1353.671,May I ask one other question?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1353.671,1354.249,Yes.
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1354.249,1363.229,"Forgetting for the moment the equal protection phase of the case because I think part of your position that all charitable organizations are not fungible, veterans are different from--"
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1363.229,1363.729,Right.
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.729,1369.04,--Do you think your First Amendment argument is equally strong regardless of the character of the organization?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1375.957,1376.924,"I do, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.262,1402.416,"But you have acknowledge, I think, that there is more than subsidy at issue."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1409.006,1411.723,"--That is correct, and it is different from Cammarano in that respect."
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.984,1434.762,"Here in effect, my Aid to the Blind organization is losing a very valuable exemption because it engages in a protected activity."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1439.324,1448.211,"--Yes, but it is just as true here as it was in Buckley and in Monner and in McRae, and in those last two cases the Court said,"
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.863,1456.127,"No, but in none of those cases did the claimant lose anything."
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1457.831,1461.251,That's true and there is that distinction as we have observed.
1982.81-2338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.063,1473.074,Is there any other case in which merely because a party engaged in an activity protected by the First Amendment that the Government was allowed to take something away from it?
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1473.074,1498.222,"--So far as I know, at least in that respect, you will be making mula in this case, but I submit to you that the principle from which that mula ought to be made has been declared by Cammarano, and that is that it is after all a matter of Congress's determining how certain activities should be financed and how valuable those activities are to Congress, and I would like to save the rest of my time."
1982.81-2338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.222,1509.153,I take you stand by your... I think it is in your reply brief... you suggest that the First Amendment issue isn't here at all.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1509.153,1509.671,That is correct.
1982.81-2338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.671,1510.919,It isn't properly here.
1982.81-2338,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1510.919,1512.982,That is correct for reasons set forth in that footnote.
1982.81-2338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.982,1521.51,Mr. Sims?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1521.51,1527.461,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.622,1709.136,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Sims, that IRS could make an evaluation in each case of each exempt taxpayer and say,"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1720.534,1730.516,"Your Honor, if Congress were to pass that alternative statute, that would deal with our argument about the disproportionate penalty."
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.125,1780.559,"Mr. Sims, you suggested a moment ago that there was a distinction to be made between lobbying for a private interest or in the public interest."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1784.104,1795.335,"That's part of Section 501(c)(3), Your Honor, in that no group can qualify under 501(c)(3) if there is going to be any inurement for the benefit of a private individual."
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.783,1809.687,So it is the common law concept of inuring to the private groups as opposed to the public groups.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1809.687,1834.754,"It is a common law concept that has been incorporated in the statute, and that is also reflected in the regulations, so to the extent that one can discuss a concern about the possibility that lobbying might be directed to a private end, that is already dealt with in a number of other ways in the statute and in the regulations and, as you have indicated, in the common law of charities and trusts."
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1834.754,1841.629,"Well, the truth of the matter is if you set a trust for your own benefit, that is not charity."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1841.629,1843.143,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.143,1845.455,"Well, I don't understand your public and private."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1848.78,1850.547,A private foundation is--
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.547,1852.934,I said a private charity.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1852.934,1856.307,--I'm not sure that there is such a--
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.307,1858.869,You said the difference between the public and the private.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1858.869,1878.549,"--Your Honor, the terminology that we have been using in our brief and that I have been trying to use today is public charity which is not a statutory term of art, but it is a term that is used often to refer to charities, that is, 501(c)(3) groups, which are not private foundations."
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.128,1918.438,What would the Ford Foundation be?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1918.438,1919.955,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.955,1922.595,What would the Ford Foundation be?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1924.077,1924.782,I'm not sure.
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.716,1927.624,"Well, what are you talking about if you don't know?"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1933.668,1940.368,"A private foundation is defined in Section 509 in terms of the sources of income, so--"
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.368,1943.429,"I'm talking about charity, not foundation."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1943.429,1949.77,"--Well, a private foundation under Section 509 is a subcategory of Section 501(c)(3) charities."
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.77,1952.457,Just because you are named by an individual?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1952.457,1977.714,"No, because the sources of revenue for that particular subcategory of charitable organizations comes primarily from a small number of sources rather than from the general public, so in enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1969, Congress indicated that there wasn't the same discipline of public support for those groups that there is for public charities, but this case only involved public charities."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.714,1981.102,Is there any issue like this in the cases as far as you know?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1981.102,1984.413,Involving--
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.413,1986.554,This distinction.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,1988.239,2000.733,"--Well, the distinction is only relevant to the extent that it addresses the concern expressed about the diversion of charitable resources to private benefits."
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.193,2035.704,"Mr. Sims, do you agree with the Solicitor General that a 501(c)(3) organization lobbying loses its exemption?"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2035.704,2044.31,"First of all, an organization is permitted to lobby up to the level of substantiality under Section 501(c)(3)."
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.713,2055.68,Could it then qualify for 501(c)(4)?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2055.68,2059.662,It could up until the Tax Reform Act of 1976.
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.522,2334.332,So you are really challenging on First Amendment grounds the whole lobbying qualification in 501(c)(3).
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2334.332,2337.658,"Your Honor, we are challenging both."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.467,2348.295,I understand that.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2354.339,2357.151,"Your Honor, we believe that the issue is here."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.78,2386.432,What about your qualification to argue it as an Appellee?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2386.432,2390.012,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.012,2395.288,Suppose you had never filed a cross appeal.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2397.617,2405.895,"We believe... I think there is something to the Government's argument that the relief would be different, and if it weren't a 1252 case."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.47,2416.828,--All right.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2417.671,2428.543,"On Cammarano, we do think that the penalty issue is very important, that there is not the correspondence here that there was in the Cammarano case."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2471.399,2493.688,Do you suggest that Congress cannot distinguish between an organization formed let us say to help the handicapped and others of that kind where there is a great deal of public activity in the area that these activities supplemented?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2515.725,2516.334,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2520.162,2522.549,Congress has an enormous respect for the veterans.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2528.41,2531.673,--The problem is not the favorable treatment.
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.794,2540.17,I'm addressing that.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2546.542,2554.661,"--Your Honor, we don't believe that there could be more favorable treatment of that sort unless it can meet the First Amendment standard of review."
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.741,2668.336,"Mr. Sims, supposing the cure to the problem you are now addressing was to just say,"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2674.458,2677.878,"It wouldn't, Your Honor, and we don't think that is the appropriate relief."
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.705,2683.44,It would remove the illegality which you are now purporting to describe.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2683.44,2683.845,--That's right.
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.009,2740.524,So you don't defend the Court of Appeals' result in this respect?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2740.524,2742.771,"No, and in fact no one does so far as I know."
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.487,2760.985,Then don't you have the jurisdictional problem that you are basically arguing for relief as an Appellee that was different than that granted by the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2760.985,2770.979,"Yes, Your Honor, so that everything that I said before with regard to the First Amendment issue would be equally applicable to this except to the extent that I think this Court has in the past sometimes regarded a remedy--"
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.979,2773.105,Except with respect to your cross appeal.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2774.618,2775.101,--Yes.
1982.81-2338,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2809.787,2821.985,But can you think of any case in which this Court has granted someone a benefit under the Internal Revenue Code which Congress didn't choose to grant them because of an equal protection argument?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2821.985,2825.83,"I'm not aware of any tax case that does that, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.83,2841.322,"But there is one case in this Court where it says that on equal protection argument, you cannot solve it by taking away from the other one, Cummins against the Board of Education, 1914."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2841.322,2845.304,I'm glad to hear about it.
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.111,2860.785,That was a California--
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2860.785,2861.378,That's right.
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.248,2877.105,"--While we are talking about remedy, may I ask you what you would suggest is the proper... if we put to one side for a moment the equal protection problem and just concentrate on the First Amendment and your argument that there is a penalty here, how do you cure that?"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2890.241,2901.64,"Well, we think that the right way to cure it would be to pass a statute that if there are particular abuses that are concerned relating to lobbying such as improper lobbying for private purposes, that the statute--"
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.64,2910.293,Suppose that Congress decides that 60 percent of your revenue is spent on lobbying and they don't want to subsidize the lobbying portion of your work.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2917.777,2921.524,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, because in this case--"
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.524,2924.803,"Well, then you really are not relying on the penalty aspect of the case."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,2924.803,2925.836,"--Well, we are relying on both."
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.938,2990.682,"But my question is on the assumption that we are not troubled with... we say we agree with the Government that veterans are different from Aid to the Blind because taking away their exemption won't really help you, and we are just concerned with your First Amendment issue on its own bottom."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3008.128,3010.284,--I haven't developed a specific one.
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.486,3025.184,Does that sound like your position is that the Government must subsidize the lobbying?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3025.184,3027.356,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.356,3029.123,Just to be consistent with the First Amendment.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3029.123,3031.26,"No, our argument is that the Government--"
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.26,3035.276,What limited relief besides that could you have?
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3045.754,3059.983,"--Well, I think Justice Stevens is asking whether a remedy could be developed that would prevent subsidy of lobbying but still allow deductibility for other charitable activities."
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.552,3090.298,So you must keep the exemption going for people who lobby for charitable purposes.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3090.298,3094.487,"--The Congress, if it is going to single out that category of First Amendment activity--"
1982.81-2338,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.487,3095.313,"So, yes, they do."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3104.122,3106.263,"--Yes, that is our position."
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.263,3108.809,And must to that extent be subsidized.
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3108.809,3113.555,Unless Congress could explain in a way that would meet this Court's First Amendment--
1982.81-2338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.555,3120.96,"We see the problem, but we can't figure out administratively any way to avoid the... we have the two extremes."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3134.53,3151.041,"--Well, the Tax Reform Act of 1969 shows that when Congress does what to specifically address an identified problem it can do it, and that's exactly what it did with regard to the perceived abuses and activities by private foundations."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.041,3164.973,"But you have already conceded I thought in discussion that Congress can favor some entities like the veterans, the handicapped, over others."
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3166.471,3167.738,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.398,3210.236,"When the blind and the veterans engage in lobbying, it is to advance a broad public interest that has been recognized in other settings by Congress, is it not?"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3210.236,3211.078,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3230.993,3235.442,"They don't have a case before the Court for us to make an evaluation of their problem, do they?"
1982.81-2338,1,32826,john_cary_sims,,3235.442,3241.05,"No, all their activities are limited by the same statute that limits Taxation's activities."
1982.81-2338,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3314.365,3329.03,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1982.81-2338,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3329.03,3332.809,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has some questions."
1982.81-2338,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.809,3334.197,"Thank you, gentlemen."
