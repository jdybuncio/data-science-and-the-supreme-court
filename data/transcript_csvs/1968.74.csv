1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,30.578,47.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Justices of the Honorable Supreme Court of the United States, I would like to indicate at the outset for the record that I would like to allocate my time in 20 minutes for argument and reserve 10 minutes if possible for rebuttal."
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,47.491,48.418,It's alright.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,48.418,49.54,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,299.653,311.067,"Now did it -- in advising the draft board that he would be away from his residence, did he advise them where he would be?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,311.067,319.499,"If it please the Court, he did not but he did advice them that he would in fact furnish addresses if it please the Court and I --"
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,319.499,320.745,Can he do it later?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,320.745,323.146,"He did, if it please the Court."
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,383.298,390.689,And was it sent to the -- to that address wrong -- wrongly by the board?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,390.689,390.839,No.
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,390.839,393.989,And did it -- did the Board sent it to his correct address.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,393.989,397.531,The Board did in fact send it to the correct address if it please the Court.
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,401.91,406.417,"Well, you mean the Post Office Department wrongly delivered it to another place?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,406.417,407.116,No.
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,407.745,409.218,"Well, what are the facts?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,410.19,438.825,"The facts briefly, Your Honor, that the communication was in fact addressed to the appellant at 10 Foulk Road and that the same was in fact received by a person other than the appellant and that the return receipt received by the draft board indicated that it was received at a post office box, Post Office Box 10, if it please the Court but a different address."
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,504.806,507.599,What was the notification they sent from Mexico?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,509.024,517.14,The -- the -- he advised them as to an address in Mexico if it please the Court.
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,517.14,519.111,Where he could be reached?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,519.111,520.837,"Yes, if it please the Court."
1968.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.178,619.622,"Am I right in understanding that your defense, your sole defense at the trial was a defense of insanity?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,619.622,620.773,"No, if it please the Court."
1968.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.747,630.915,Yes.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,630.915,644.676,"The record if it please the Court, I feel is replete of testimony from both sides and I'd like to deviate for a moment to explain that if it please the Court."
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,743.75,772.821,"Oh, was that the issue that you were raising, the so-called insanity issue whether he was emotionally unfit for military service or were you raising a defense in conventional criminal terms that the view of the M'Naghten test or that he was unable to distinguish between right or wrong or unable to control his actions."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,777.292,785.78,"If it please the Court, at the particular time the jurisdiction in Rhode Island was following this so-called M'Naghten rule."
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,785.78,805.151,"Well then, does the question of whether he was or was not mentally or emotionally suitable for a military service and then being new at the M'Naghten rule except possibly that it involves some of the same criterion but the standards are quite different, isn't it?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,805.151,806.034,"I agree with you, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,806.034,818.584,"Let's say, what fitness or unfitness has an emotional matter for a military service have to do with the issues that were before the District Court and now before us?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,818.584,826.921,"If it please the Court, at the trial level, it was a clearly a straight criminal defense and I filed a straight criminal defense --"
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,826.921,828.529,On the M'Naghten basis?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,828.529,831.089,-- of not guilty by reason of insanity if it please the Court.
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,831.089,833.055,The M'Naghten test?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,833.055,836.785,The M'Naghten test was in fact applicable at that time.
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,836.785,837.342,Right.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,837.342,843.737,I requested the trial justice to give to me a charge under the American Law Institute Rule.
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,848.909,849.794,Alright.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,849.794,859.953,But my psychiatrist if it please the Court found that the applicant in this case and the defendant in that case was in fact insane.
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,865.341,867.665,"Well, are you -- now you're saying insane."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,878.761,880.093,The --
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,880.093,892.226,He testified in terms of an American Law Institute Case test or the M'Naghten test or did he test by in terms of the military suitability?
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,892.226,905.627,"If it please the Court, the transcript would indicate that as far as military suitability goes, he testified clearly that the defendant -- appellant was not suitable."
1968.74,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,960.672,979.084,You are here urging that its reversed -- the trial judge may -- have committed reversible error by failing to find that the judgment against the defendant should've been not guilty by reason of insanity.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,979.084,981.594,"In effect, yes Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.708,994.318,"Mr. Rogers, may I ask you, I noticed you opened -- you said you're going to give only 20 minutes."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,994.318,995.187,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.187,1001.071,"You haven't yet touched on the issue that I must say to you in all candors, the only one really concerns me in this case."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1001.071,1001.944,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.944,1007.289,"And that's one, the refusal of the trial judge to postpone the trial, are you going to get to that?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1007.289,1007.788,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1134.541,1159.708,"Well, is this the situation that as you saw it at the time -- if the Government were to find on an examination that he was not in fact fit for induction that then the Government is having said that those who -- this examination, if the find, “I am fit for induction, I'll be inducted.”"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1171.034,1171.371,No.
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1176.231,1177.254,"Well, let me ask you this."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1177.254,1177.342,Yes Your Honor.
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1177.342,1185.479,I'm looking at this colloquy between the trial judge and the -- Mr. Giron I gather represented the Government.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1185.479,1186.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.478,1195.653,"And Mr. Giron says, this is the position that if this man submits to induction in all probability, he will not be acceptable anyway."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1225.044,1225.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1225.741,1241.753,"And then the Government had to -- in effect, I thought your position was -- although the Government was willing to postpone the trial and not even to go forward with the prosecution if in fact it were determined that he was not fit for induction."
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1251.706,1252.387,If it please the Court --
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1252.387,1253.569,"Well, is that or not?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1253.569,1254.334,It is not Your Honor.
1968.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1254.334,1254.832,Alright.
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1254.832,1265.341,"The examination had already been accomplished at that time and the trial justice well knew the findings of the three Navy psychiatrists at that time, if it please the Court."
1968.74,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1269.345,1275.518,"Well that's what the court -- the court said, “I had seen no need of it, let's try this case and get it behind us.”"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1275.518,1277.728,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.728,1279.742,"Well, that's what the judge did say?"
1968.74,0,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,1279.742,1281.885,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1281.885,1290.041,Mr. Solicitor General?
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1290.041,1293.345,May it please the Court.
1968.74,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1396.352,1411.207,"Well apart -- Mr. Solicitor General, from the prosecution as such, I gather that a finding that he was unfit might have a bearing might it not on the issue of whether the trial should've been postponed?"
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1411.207,1416.282,The question whether the trial should be postponed is another issue.
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.244,1429.041,"Well, apart from the merits of the prosecution itself, it may not -- as you say, that he was not fit for induction may not have been relevant on the issue of guilt or innocence."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1429.041,1430.055,That is what I might say --
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.055,1433.899,"But it might well be, it might well matter -- wouldn't it not be relevant on the issue whether --"
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1433.899,1436.887,"Yes, Mr. Justice and that is one of the two issues which I am --"
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.887,1437.282,Yes.
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1437.282,1438.929,-- I'm picking out of the group.
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.068,1440.752,Excuse me.
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1440.752,1450.965,-- of others and perhaps I didn't make it clear it enough that that I have thought of as a somewhat different issue than the one as to whether the trial should have been postponed.
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.137,2307.231,Does the record show where this petitioner was a student?
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2307.231,2310.769,"Yes, I've -- the record shows that he was classified 2-S."
1968.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.769,2311.111,Yes.
1968.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2314.539,2316.421,"Well, up here it's Columbia University at the time they sent --"
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2316.421,2325.233,It says Columbia University at the time of trial whether he was a student.
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.522,2515.626,"Mr. Solicitor General on page 18, Mr. Giron, we would continue it if this man."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2521.213,2524.554,What -- Mr. Justice what -- where is it on page 18?
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.554,2529.371,"The second from the last way down, two-thirds down."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2529.371,2533.034,"Yes, yes."
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.506,2542.143,"Well, you are."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2542.143,2548.18,"Because even if it is, I think the judge had discretion to deny it."
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.18,2556.185,"But I'm also worried with the judge's language, sort of a gung ho language."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2556.185,2560.567,"Well, either he is guilty or he isn't, I guess it's a --"
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2560.567,2562.697,"Well, let's get it behind us."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2566.517,2569.012,"Well, I agree Mr. Justice."
1968.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2571.366,2572.744,It would've been better if it wasn't.
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2572.744,2589.645,"Hadn't been handled the way it was but I, except in terms of what is sometimes referred to in the books as this Court's supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice."
1968.74,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.576,2623.255,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General I suppose that this accurately state your position that the best you can make out of this colloquy is that the Government representative would have -- would not have objected to a continuance if the judge thought on the facts as he and Mr. Rogers laid them out for the judge to justify."
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2623.255,2628.258,I think that's exactly what I get out.
1968.74,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.258,2630.72,That's the most that you can get out of it?
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2630.72,2631.055,"Well, I think that --"
1968.74,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.055,2633.29,It was if the Government wasn't urging at the beginning.
1968.74,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2633.29,2635.893,I think that's the most I can get out of it.
1968.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2647.592,2649.352,Mr. Rogers.
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,2649.352,2651.216,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1968.74,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2872.023,2882.017,You're not really suggesting that petitioner in good faith left a series of forwarding addresses?
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,2882.017,2885.191,"I do Mr. Justice Fortas, I truly do."
1968.74,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2898.914,2900.707,That wasn't my question.
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,2900.707,2900.904,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1968.74,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2900.904,2936.718,My question was whether that your contention based on this record that the judge should have instructed the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty because you're client in good faith left a series of forwarding addresses at which he might have received notice had the board been diligent in giving him notice.
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,2936.718,2939.251,Yes I am if it please the Court.
1968.74,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3047.26,3056.467,How do you explain the two instances where he declined to appear for physical examinations?
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,3056.467,3060.925,I have nothing factual if it please the Court to back up what I say.
1968.74,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3091.572,3094.385,Leaving the insanity aside for a moment the --
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,3094.385,3095.027,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3095.027,3102.799,-- the letter --- reads a letter that he wrote to the board saying he didn't want to be associated with murderers and so forth --
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,3102.799,3103.499,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.74,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3103.499,3136.947,"-- and his refusal on two occasions at least to appear for physical examinations should those be taken into consideration in determining whether these postcards and letters that he got from Tennessee with no address from a general delivery address at Veracruz, shouldn't it be taken -- take -- those things should be taken into consideration in determining whether he was actually trying to comply with the regulations."
1968.74,2,19956,charles_j_rogers_jr,,3136.947,3138.321,"Yes, Your Honor."
