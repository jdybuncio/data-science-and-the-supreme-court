1966.252,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.279,"Harvey Lyle Entsminger, petitioner versus Iowa."
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,19.57,25.006,"Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.867,192.841,"The printed, the printed record is the full record --"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,192.841,193.884,"The full record, yes sir."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.884,195.377,-- including any of the testimony that --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,195.377,196.003,Yes.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,196.003,196.929,-- is relevant.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,196.929,197.552,"Yes, Justice White."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,198.344,206.692,"Isn't the counsel, doesn't the Attorney General pretty much concede this part of your case?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,206.692,207.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,207.485,234.293,"Now on page, for example, on page 28 of his brief, as well as elsewhere, it seems to me that he suggests that you are entitled to have the case remanded to the Iowa Supreme Court because of the inaction of court-appointed counsel and have the case remanded for carrying the appeal on the basis of the record."
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,234.293,235.192,"Yes, Your Honor, Justice Fortas"
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,235.192,237.692,"Now, where does that leave us?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,237.692,246.743,"I think that basically, this is the primary relief that we are seeking here although we do raise the additional issue as to whether or not there is a sufficient record before this Court."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,246.743,247.442,Sufficient what?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,247.442,257.069,Sufficient record before this Court because the actual trial transcript has been introduced as an exhibit filed with the record on appeal.
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,264.048,278.734,"Yes, but the real question, the question then the only remaining question that I see as subject here enlightened -- enlightening me is whether we ought to reach the search and seizure question?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,278.734,278.896,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,278.896,292.691,Or whether we just ought to remand as the Attorney General if I correctly understand his brief suggests that Iowa Supreme Court for the consideration of the appeal.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,292.691,292.823,Well --
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,292.823,293.796,Am I -- am I right in --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,293.796,296.59,"Yes, you're absolutely right, Justice Fortas."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,296.59,296.973,Was that --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,296.973,343.636,"That the Attorney -- the Attorney General as a matter of fact in this particular case, the appointed counsel Mr. Warnley finally did serve, after the expiration of this 90-day period, Mr. Warnley did served a notice on the Attorney General specifying his intent to file a record and a brief and although the Iowa Supreme Court had ordered that the case be submitted on a clerk's transcript which is not a transcript of the record at all, that the Iowa Supreme Court set aside that order without prejudice to the Attorney General's office to file a motion to dismiss and I think it's indicative of the Attorney General's office that they did not elect to stand on the technicality of a motion to dismiss, but rather wanted to have the appeal heard in substance."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,403.332,403.448,I may --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,403.448,404.846,- the case occurred here.
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,404.846,428.935,"I may be wrong about this, but my reading of the -- my recollection of the Attorney General's brief is that at least state is agreeable having this case remanded to the Iowa courts for consideration of the appeal on the basis of a complete record and with the newly appointed counsel."
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,428.935,430.19,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.252,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,430.19,434.004,"So, if that so, I don't see what we've got left here --"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,434.004,434.683,Well (Voice Overlap) --
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.683,435.578,Do you mean --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,435.578,435.908,Yes.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.908,458.172,"I would -- I would be interested in knowing whether or not the clerk's transcript system that you call it, is something that is used regularly by lawyers who have examined the record and have decided on their own that there is nothing really to appeal here."
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,503.145,503.35,I think --
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.35,504.739,What is -- what is it in this case?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,516.225,518.868,"Your Honor, I think it happens in both instances."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.539,540.025,If I may --
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,540.025,544.274,-- they've got to do something when they received the record the transcript in December already.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.248,555.833,Yes.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,555.833,564.615,"He says, that on the basis of my examination of the record, I don't think you have any basis for appeal or in substance this is what he says."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.867,567.454,Yes.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,567.454,568.708,-- or whether or not he really felt that.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.708,573.842,"Oh you mean, there's -- the record does contain some expression by him that -- that there's no merit."
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,573.842,575.615,"Well, this is a very late expression."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.543,579.124,What would you say the rule should be?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,596.535,608.191,"Your Honor, I think the basic constitutional issues is whether or not the clerk's transcript system can be used as a vehicle by court-appointed counsel because I don't think would happen --"
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.191,609.395,Yes but that's not my question.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,609.395,615.691,"In your -- in your situation, I don't think there would be any basis for appeal because I don't see any equal protection argument."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.977,617.157,"Well, then --"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,617.157,617.74,-- outright --
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.74,625.483,"-- what if, but do you think there should be a constitutional rule if appointed counsel makes this same error?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,625.483,636.716,"Well, I think that the -- that the dangers are far greater in court appointed counsel doing this because of laziness or inadvertence, whereas I think that the retained counsel is not going let this happen, at least I don't think --"
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.716,639.257,I guess it happens all the time?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,639.257,642.047,"It does happen, but I don't think the degree is nearly as great."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.153,676.926,"But the -- but the appointed counsel, the defendant with hired counsel who haven't -- the hired counsel went through the same procedure, would have received exactly the same treatment as the Supreme Court, wouldn't he?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,676.926,680.596,"Yes, if this were a conscientious effort to do it."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.798,688.661,What do you mean?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,688.661,700.92,I think that the likelihood of a -- of a retained lawyer through neglect letting a clerk's transcript system arise is much less than the likelihood of a court-appointed lawyer.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.92,702.801,Do you think this makes a constitutional difference?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,702.801,715.055,"I think it makes a constitutional difference to the extent that if the man could have retained a lawyer, I don't think it would have happened nearly as much as it might have happened in the other situation, yes sir."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.055,715.468,Okay.
1966.252,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,715.468,732.72,"I suppose if -- if the retained lawyer took the money and then did nothing for him and his counsel, I mean, his client had wanted him to do so, he'd be subject to discipline, wouldn't he, by the -- by the Bar for having neglected his professional duty?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,732.72,734.02,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.252,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,738.92,739.442,Yes.
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,739.442,742.336,"-- but again, you have -- it's a question of judgment."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.155,778.986,"Well, in Iowa -- the -- by the transcript system, the Iowa Court never gets around looking at the printed record or anything?"
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,778.986,779.465,No.
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.089,783.291,Never passes on anything that was raised on the motion for new trial?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,783.291,797.009,"That's correct, and as a matter of fact, the tragedy here was that there actually was a full transcript of the trial court record available at the time it went up on the clerk, â€“ at the time the Iowa Supreme Court ordered it to submit on the clerk's transcript."
1966.252,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.484,818.18,But is it one step beyond the California as we heard about yesterday?
1966.252,0,20576,david_w_belin,,818.18,818.581,Yes sir.
1966.252,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,867.519,869.285,Very well.
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,870.719,879.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.902,1020.673,In this case?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1020.673,1022.229,In this case.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1028.796,1031.253,Because of the insufficiency of the indictment or something like that?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1031.253,1036.049,Or the Griffin versus California error where the instructions are part of the clerk's transcript --
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.049,1036.387,The instructions are --
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1036.387,1042.944,-- and the Court -- yes and the Court has charged the jury relative to the defendant Enstminger to take witness stand.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.944,1043.165,For what?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1043.165,1044.416,That should result on reversal?
1966.252,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1044.416,1046.714,As a matter of question of law?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1046.714,1047.925,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.925,1052.551,"Well, what does the clerk's transcript consist?"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1052.551,1062.046,"Well, there's -- unfortunately, there is no uniformity among the various clerks in the state but, by and large, you can expect to find a copy of either the indictment or the information."
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.367,1112.468,So there might be cases as Justice Douglas suggests where the questions is one of law and not at all as to insufficiency of the evidence or rulings on admission of evidence or anything but simply the sufficiency of the indictment or the instructions to the jury as to what the content of the particular offense was or -- where a clerk's transcript would be adequate?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1112.468,1120.982,"Well, that's correct Your Honor except -- I appreciate that whenever clerk's transcript is used for a review there is no argument."
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.5,1125.639,"Well, you --"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1125.639,1134.61,"What happens is the -- the printed record, this is an abstract of the record, it's not usually the full trial record and the trial transcript."
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.212,1143.526,So there is no argument?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1143.526,1143.961,Right.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.961,1167.706,"Well, I don't quite follow that because you think that there might be cases where a perfectly -- a perfectly careful lawyer might have one good solid point on appeal which could be fully disclosed and exposed by a clerk's transcript and therefore he wouldn't bother asking for anything else and then he'd go and argue his case and probably win it if let's say there were instructions and violation of Griffin against California."
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1168.693,1170.513,And this is very conceivable.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1179.219,1180.268,Without any -- without any --
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1180.268,1180.426,Right.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.426,1180.783,-- argument?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1182.74,1183.825,Right.
1966.252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1183.825,1184.718,No briefing here?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1184.718,1188.34,"No briefing, no record, just the clerk's transcript."
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.42,1216.469,"But in the -- in this case, the state did appoint counsel to represent him on appeal?"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1216.469,1217.256,Well --
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.256,1218.009,Didn't they?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1218.009,1218.577,Yes.
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.021,1240.48,And the sole -- the state furnished him counsel and the counsel either decided this to submit it on the clerk's transcript because he didn't see any merit in it or simply neglected to proceed with the appeal which he's told this company or his client that he was proceeding with.
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1244.919,1259.29,I would say that the indications in the record probably go to more of the -- more of neglect of some sort rather than counsel having come to a conclusion that the appeal was frivolous.
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.29,1260.183,Well then --
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1260.183,1271.601,Because counsel had written the petitioner on two different occasions; once in March and once again in September indicating that a -- that a brief or a record would be filed.
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.601,1295.594,"Would you say -- or would -- you would suggest then that the constitutional rule in appointed cases, in appointed cases, the -- the appeal would not be disposed of for any reason without a full record in the appearance of counsel."
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1295.594,1299.068,"No, I wouldn't suggest that if I follow your question --"
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.068,1312.143,"Well, what I -- what I wonder is that why do you think the defendant should not be charged with the error or neglect of his counsel, like he might well be if the counsel was retained?"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1312.143,1314.155,In this given -- in this case?
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.155,1314.558,"Well, yes?"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1314.558,1316.735,"Now -- well, in the first place, I am not certain."
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.012,1327.22,Yes.
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1327.22,1331.483,â€“ and his client received a clerk's transcript appeal that you wouldn't have a constitutional problem there.
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.483,1334.209,"Well, that's -- that really what I am --"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1334.209,1345.656,I suppose (Voice Overlap) you could express it -- you could express that in -- in terms of ineffective assistance of counsel or something of that akin and this would entitle that individual to relief.
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.356,1371.342,Would you think the rule as saying that the both appointive and hired counsel -- what is unconstitutional there?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1375.02,1377.186,In the case of a retained counsel?
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.186,1386.374,"Well, you say that it's a constitutional should be the same, what is -- what is the constitutional error if -- if they affirm on a clerk's transcript."
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1386.374,1388.798,"Well, in the case of the indigent --"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1388.798,1401.524,"-- because if you say that they used the clerk's transcript on which to affirm in both -- in both the appointed case and in the retained case, you say that -- that's that -- that's wrong."
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1401.524,1401.811,"Well, in the case --"
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.811,1403.402,-- (Voice Overlap) why is it wrong?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1405.092,1432.764,"In the case of the indigent, and in keeping with this Court's decisions starting with Griffin versus Illinois, right on down to the one that the Court decided, I understand a week or a few days ago, you could spell out the constitutional violation where the Indigent is concerned by State stating that he has not received adequate and full plenary review to which he is entitled and the reason he hasn't received it is because he wasn't able to fire an attorney."
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.014,1466.473,"So really -- that's a -- so, are you conceding in this case a constitutional violation of Equal Protection or of the Sixth Amendment?"
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1466.473,1486.949,"This question has bothered me and one that I haven't really come to resolve myself, but I do believe that under this record we would have to concede that this indigent was not or did not obtain whole and effective appellate review to which he was entitled and that within this Court's decisions, he wouldn't be entitled to relief for that reason."
1966.252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.949,1492.94,And yet make the same concession if on the same facts retained counsel did the same thing?
1966.252,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1492.94,1506.594,"Well, I -- I'm willing to state for the sake of argument that I believe I would make the concession that there would be a constitutional violation if he did nothing and that his client -- and didn't let his client know of anything."
1966.252,2,29010,justice_bernnan,,2442.655,2447.669,[Inaudible] do you think we're going to have to [Inaudible] than that?
1966.252,3,20552,don_r_bennett,,2447.669,2448.146,"Well, I don't think so."
1966.252,4,29010,justice_bernnan,,2448.146,2453.262,That was what Mr. Belin raised but I wondered the why we have to spend time on it?
1966.252,5,20552,don_r_bennett,,2453.262,2453.695,Alright I --
1966.252,6,29010,justice_bernnan,,2453.695,2456.314,"Those -- those issues aren't here, are they?"
1966.252,7,20552,don_r_bennett,,2456.314,2457.793,"Well, Mr. Belin thinks they are."
1966.252,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2504.954,2506.869,Mr. Belin.
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2506.869,2511.645,"I'd like to make two comments if I may, first with regard to the merits of the case."
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.405,2548.449,It also bears -- it also bears on whether or not the counsel made any -- actually decided [Inaudible]
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2548.449,2550.608,"Yes, that's the very point Your Honor."
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.084,2611.67,"Mr. Belin, what if there are two cases before the Iowa Supreme Court exactly like this one where the exactly the same thing happened and one of the case the counsel was appointed and in the other case, the counsel was retained? Exactly the same thing [Inaudible] in this case, do you think it will have the identical results?"
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2611.67,2620.233,"Your Honor, my personal belief is it there should be because I don't think that there has been in the one appeal that the defendant has as a matter of right."
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.286,2633.681,"What's the deprivation, [Inaudible] deprivation as to both of these --"
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2633.681,2638.409,I would say effective assistance of counsel in both situations.
1966.252,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2639.447,2642.151,What would be the ineffective assistance of counsel?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2642.151,2646.411,"No presentation of either a record or a brief -- or brief in arguments, so that the court itself --"
1966.252,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2646.411,2652.666,Failing to file -- failing to file a proper bill of exceptions or what have you told us?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2652.666,2664.09,"Failure to file a record, fail to file a brief in argument while knowingly, in a state procedure that it really be -- it's the state procedure itself that permits this thing to happen."
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.09,2669.909,"Well, what's the -- what's the state charge if anything in an appointed counsel situation?"
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2669.909,2671.038,In the appointed counsel --
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.038,2673.439,I mean in the -- in the retained counsel?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2673.439,2676.551,In the retained counsel there is a question of state action.
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.125,2694.817,There would be the same with the retained counsel?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2694.817,2695.766,Pardon?
1966.252,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.766,2699.029,"If the same thing happened with the retained counsel, it would be the same for â€“"

1966.252,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2711.757,2713.031,Do you call that a --
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2713.031,2713.252,Pardon?
1966.252,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2713.252,2720.774,Do you call that a constitutional defect that the counsel didn't file a paper?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2720.774,2726.745,"Mr. Justice Black, I don't think the counsel -- the fact that the counsel doesn't file a paper makes it a constitutional defect."
1966.252,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2726.745,2730.653,Maybe it's one that has to be filed in order to get the appeal?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2744.538,2745.528,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.047,2808.503,"I'm looking at -- through the statement of -- the statement of facts in your brief and I thought I'd seen that -- that Mr. Enstminger himself had written to the Supreme Court, well, I don't see that."
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2808.958,2809.937,"Well, yes -- yes, Your Honor."
1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.058,2817.992,27 of the record

1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.386,2842.381,Yes.
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2844.385,2844.895,That was --
1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2844.895,2847.825,"It's dated -- it's dated October 8th, 1965?"
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2847.825,2848.688,"Yes, and the opinion --"
1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2848.688,2850.015,Where did that fall in the chronology?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2850.015,2857.55,"Well, the -- the dismissal of the petition for writ was on October 18 and the opinion was on October 19th."
1966.252,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2857.55,2858.426,About 10 days after?
1966.252,8,20576,david_w_belin,,2858.426,2861.174,Yes sir.
