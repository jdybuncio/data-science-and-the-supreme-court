1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.472,"Mr. Solicitor General, the Government’s motion to conduct part of the oral arguments involving security matters in-camera, as has been done in the District Court’s of New York and in Washington and in the Courts of Appeals, in the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit is denied for the Court."
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,52.691,93.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I say in respect of the announcement just made that all three parties have filed a closed brief as well as the open brief and in addition, I have filed just within minutes, two statements, one prepared by the state department and one prepared by the department of defense, giving more detail about some of the items which are discussed in my closed brief and I believe that those will all be before the Court."
1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.361,100.297,Are you suggesting that these matters last filed are security matters or they merely supplement and explain --
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,100.297,104.355,The only ones that are security matters that I have filed are all marked top secret.
1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,104.355,107.15,"I see, thank you very much."
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,110.611,125.04,"The items filed by the Post and the Times, I do not believe are marked top secret, but they are marked in-camera in the caption of the items."
1970.1873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,807.371,811.753,"Mr. Solicitor General, of course, as the Times Film case as well and there are no doubt others."
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,856.084,860.665,"Mr. Justice if they have conceded it, I am glad to proceed on that basis."
1970.1873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.665,868.554,"No I am not conceding it for them, but that had been my understanding of what the issue is."
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,870.351,882.497,"I may say that their brief were served on me within the last 15 minutes which -- the last hour which was entirely in accordance with this Court’s order, but I have not seen their briefs."
1970.1873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.798,898.866,"In other words, I have thought in my analysis and I haven't had the benefit of much more time than you had, that this basically came down to a fact case that the issues here are factual issues?"
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,898.866,902.37,And that Mr. Justice is extremely difficult to discuss --
1970.1873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.37,903.331,"Argue here in this Court, I understand."
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,903.331,910.146,--in open court and we have endeavored to --
1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.146,921.041,Is then to say qualifying and acceptance of the scope of the initial review of the executive determination (Inaudible)
1970.1873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.041,931.938,And that is the throughout the standard --
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,931.938,944.475,"Mr. Justice White, it was the latter point for which I was seeking to get this because our contention, particularly with respect to the Washington Post case is that the wrong standard has been used."
1970.1873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1084.268,1087.705,I thought the New York Times was required too and did give you a list of --
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1087.705,1096.133,"They prepared an inventory but from it, it is not possible to tell whether they are the same papers that we have."
1970.1873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.887,1198.16,"Mr. Solicitor, your closed brief cover all of the items on a special appendix and any that you think should be added to it?"
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1198.16,1201.149,"No Mr. Justice, it does not refer to all of them."
1970.1873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.538,1247.995,"Well Mr. Solicitor General, if we disagreed with you on those that you have covered, the remainder of the items need to be looked at?"
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1247.995,1254.57,"Mr. Justice, I think that the odds are strong that that is an accurate statement."
1970.1873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.489,1271.501,Are you making an argument that even if those ten that you have covered don’t move us very far that nevertheless the cumulative impact of all the others might tip the scale?
1970.1873,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1271.501,1283.031,And that there ought to be an opportunity for a full and free judicial consideration of each of the items covered in the supplemental appendix.
1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.543,1368.809,What was the length of the trial before Judge signed in the argument?
1970.1873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.809,1370.208,Mr. Seymour --
1970.1873,1,40878,seymour,,1370.208,1376.787,"The in-camera proceedings Your Honor were approximately four hours, including cross examination and argument."
1970.1873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.787,1381.556,What was the length of the hearing in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit?
1970.1873,1,40878,seymour,,1381.556,1391.705,"The camera argument, the total argument there public and in-camera was just over 3 hours, in-camera portion I would guess was about an hour."
1970.1873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1391.705,1397.246,And decisions were rendered in the New York case by the District Court within two days after which --
1970.1873,1,40878,seymour,,1397.246,1405.235,"Then less than 24 hours after, Your Honor, the hearing finally finished at 10:45 pm on Friday night."
1970.1873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.186,1412.237,And what was the time in rendering of the decision of the Court of Appeals?
1970.1873,1,40878,seymour,,1412.237,1416.397,"I believe it went one full day, Your Honor."
1970.1873,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.821,1431.287,"And the District of Columbia proceedings, of course, you don’t know, but perhaps the Solicitor General --"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1431.287,1439.613,"The trial in the District of Columbia occurred between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, including the decision last Monday."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1460.831,1477.579,"Mr. Solicitor, I don’t want to bring in a red herring in this case or which might be, but do you also say that the ten items you have talked about fully justify the classification that has been given them and it still remains on them?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1477.579,1482.222,"Mr. Justice, I’m not sure whether this case turns on classification."
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.222,1485.617,"I agree, no body does it but --"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1485.617,1493.233,No judicial proceeding has been brought under the freedom of information act by either newspaper.
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.934,1529.009,"I understand that but on those ten documents, I won’t press you anymore, you think it’s perhaps needed to be answered in this case and is perhaps irrelevant."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1529.009,1542.994,"I think it need not be answered, but my position would be that as to those 10 items, it’s more than 10 documents as to those 10 items that they are properly classified top secret."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1542.994,1545.149,Thank you.
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1545.149,1554.51,"One of the items, I should make plain is four volumes of the 47 volumes, four related volumes, all dealing with one specific subject."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1578.759,1594.947,"As I understand it Mr. Solicitor General and you tell me please, if I misunderstand it, your case doesn’t really depend upon the classification of this material, whether it’s classified or how it’s classified."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1613.001,1616.814,"I would still be here, but would have one string off my book."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.814,1618.864,"Well, I didn’t understand it was a real string and that's why I am asking the question."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1618.864,1632.995,"Well, it maybe this, but there are those who think it is and I must be careful not to concede away in this Court grounds with some responsible officers of the Government, I think how important, but I do understand --"
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.995,1660.344,Secondly I understand and tell me if I’m wrong again that your case really doesn’t depend upon any assertion of property rights by analogy to the copyright law. You are not -- your case would be the same if the New York Times that acquired this information by sending one of its employees in to steal it as it would if it had been presented to the New York Times on a silver platter.
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1660.344,1661.382,Yes Mr. Justice but I --
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1661.382,1662.569,"-- rather than (Voice Overlap) to the Government, am I correct?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1662.569,1670.902,"But I don’t -- I don’t think that literary property is wholly irrelevant here, but my case does not depend upon it."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.119,1682.135,Your case depends upon the claim as I understand it that the disclosure of this information would result in an immediate grave threat to the security of the United States of America?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1682.135,1683.075,Yes Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1683.075,1685.301,"However, it was acquired and however it’s classified."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1685.301,1699.602,"Yes, Mr. Justice but I think that the fact that it was obviously acquired improperly is not irrelevant in the consideration of that question and I repeat obviously acquired improperly."
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1699.602,1703.814,May I ask Mr. Solicitor General?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1720.058,1729.21,"It is my understanding Mr. Justice, though I have not had an opportunity to read everything that has been published in other newspapers."
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.781,1775.973,"Well then, are you suggesting that these other newspapers do not in fact have either this study or access to this study or parts of it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1775.973,1777.7,"Mr. Justice, I do not know."
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1779.186,1780.848,But you’re not telling us that they don’t?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1780.848,1781.435,No.
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1783.428,1788.798,There is the possibility that they do of either the study the same thing the Post --
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1788.798,1791.671,There is a possibility that anybody has it.
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.671,1807.066,"No, but if that were the fact, am I wrong, I’ve always thought that the rule was that the equity has to be rather careful not to issue ineffective injunctions and isn’t that a rule or the --"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1807.066,1807.428,I --
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1807.428,1808.808,-- fact to be considered in these cases?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1808.808,1809.943,"No, I appreciate that."
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.179,1864.596,"Well I gather you do agree that the ordinary equitable principle is not to issue useless injunctions, isn’t it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1864.596,1874.337,And not to issue useless injunction and it is our position that there is nothing in this record or known outside the record which would indicate that this injunction would be useless.
1970.1873,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1874.337,1878.023,"Mr. Solicitor General, one detail in that connection."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1888.544,1890.171,"No, Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1897.927,1901.7,Have either of these newspapers denied it?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1901.7,1902.987,Denied that --
1970.1873,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1902.987,1907.588,That the possession on the part of the other newspapers is not attributable to them.
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1907.588,1908.368,I don’t know.
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.286,1939.17,"Mr. Solicitor General, in terms of equity on an injunction, however, to the extent anything has been published and has already been revealed, the United States is not seeking an injunction for -- against the further publication of that particular item?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1939.17,1940.727,"No, Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1947.959,1969.841,"Well, would that mean Mr. Solicitor General that if the Government were to prevail here and that sometime, some document within the scope of the injunction that the Government got was published in some other newspaper that then either the Times and the Post could run in and get to that extent the injunction nullify?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1969.841,1971.604,I would think so Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.604,1973.835,"But that’s the only thing they could do, is that it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1973.835,1975.221,I would think so yes.
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.906,2049.513,Mr. Solicitor General is the United States pressing separately your request or your cause of action for the return of the materials wholly aside from an injunction against --
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2049.513,2052.556,"It is not involved in this case, in this Court at this time."
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.556,2053.254,It is not?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2053.254,2054.518,No.
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2054.518,2056.469,"No, but is the Government pressing?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2059.846,2063.511,I can certainly say the Government would like to get them back.
1970.1873,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2063.511,2066.387,"That wasn’t my question, my question is, is the Government attempting?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2066.387,2070.907,The Government is not at this time seeking an order for their return.
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.907,2076.304,"Well, I thought that was part of your lawsuit -- part of your request for relief and --"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2076.304,2082.918,"I believe it was, but we did not appeal with respect to that nor is it covered in our petition for certiorari."
1970.1873,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.067,2094.743,"Mr. Solicitor General on this 45-day study, does that depend on how we rule in this case or is the government going to do it anyhow?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2094.743,2098.357,"Mr. Justice, I will urge the Government to do it anyhow."
1970.1873,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.113,2115.254,"Well, suppose the Court decides the other way, will the study be made?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2115.254,2123.467,The study is going to be made.
1970.1873,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.885,2133.199,(Inaudible)
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2133.199,2134.339,I’m sorry Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.339,2143.974,"Would this mean (Inaudible) without this case that the Court, that the Government has the right to find out what’s available to be published."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2143.974,2148.49,"(Voice Overlap)Yes, Mr. Justice except that it’s a massive operation."
1970.1873,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.532,2184.885,"But if the -- this Court would by chance rule against you, then the Government will surely do it, wouldn’t it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2184.885,2200.307,"If the Court should rule against us here, then I -- then it seems to me that it becomes moot with respect to these items, they can be published and whether we classify them or declassify them as an academic question."
1970.1873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2200.307,2203.47,"Well, the Court would have done a job for you, is that not so?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2203.47,2203.892,"Yes, the --"
1970.1873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.892,2204.77,Declassify the fact.
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2204.77,2210.155,The Court will in effect have declassified the materials.
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.155,2215.495,I don’t understand that Mr. Solicitor General.
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2243.243,2249.534,"Well, you are certainly right Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.58,2286.469,But the standard concededly is not the same?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2286.469,2295.558,"It’s not the same issue and I repeat, I think it would be technically be a crime if the materials remain classified."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2296.61,2298.243,"Mr. Solicitor General, just before you do."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2316.323,2316.837,No.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.837,2318.907,Nor do I understand it that you are claiming --
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2318.907,2320.024,Nor because we own it.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.024,2327.393,"Just let me finish please, that you are entitled to an injunction because it was stolen from you, that it’s your property."
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2348.419,2348.799,Yes Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.799,2349.777,"Now, isn’t that correct?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2349.777,2349.971,Yes Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2349.971,2355.318,"So, declassifications vel non doesn’t have much to do with the basic issue, does it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2355.318,2361.753,I agree with you except to this part of the setting.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.725,2378.799,Now it would be in the public domain already?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2378.799,2389.431,"Alright but we come in and say, you can’t print this because it will gravely affect the security of United States, I think we would plainly be out."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.431,2391.901,And a very shaky case on the facts and that’s --[Laughter]
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2391.901,2394.846,Or suppose it had been --
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.846,2397.336,"And this therefore is a fact case, isn’t it?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2398.181,2399.05,No Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.05,2403.509,"-- we have to look at the facts, the evidence in this case that’s been submitted under scrutiny --"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2403.509,2434.366,"In large part, yes Mr. Justice but I’m still trying to get some help from the background and the setting which I repeat it is not irrelevant that the concatenation of words here is the property of the United States, that this has been classified under executive orders approved by Congress and that it obviously has been improperly acquired."
1970.1873,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.366,2446.347,"Well, that may have a great deal to do as to whether -- as to the question of whether or not somebody is guilty of a criminal offense, but I submit it has very little to do with the basic First Amendment issue before this Court in this case?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2446.347,2466.332,"Alright Mr. Justice, I repeat, unless we can show that this will have grave and I think I would like to amend it the -- I know the Court’s order has said immediate, but I think it really ought to be irreparable harm to the Security of United States."
1970.1873,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2466.332,2480.466,"I would think with all due respect to Kelly, that the question of classification of a Court bearing on the question of the scope of review of executive classification?"
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2480.466,2499.123,"Well I think Mr. Justice that is true, but I also think the heart of our case is that the publication of the material specified in my closed brief will as I have tried to argue there, materially affect the Security of United States."
1970.1873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.383,2933.713,Could I ask you a question before you sit down?
1970.1873,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2979.752,2980.869,"No, Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.832,3088.729,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3090.479,3093.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3116.461,3126.019,"Well Mr. Bickel, aren’t you -- aren’t you going to allow sometime for some of the -- really see what this means before they act?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3126.019,3126.76,Mr. Chief Justice --
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3126.76,3129.291,Meetings drawn and get lawyers into the Courts?
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3129.291,3131.836,I planned to return briefly to this point.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3409.736,3411.176,What was the first ground?
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3411.176,3418.877,The first ground which I am about to enter upon is the question of the separation of powers with the statute out of this case.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.877,3419.24,Yes.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3419.24,3432.38,"As I conceive it Mr. Justice, the only basis on which the injunction can issue is a theory which I think the Solicitor General holds of an inherent presidential power."
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3433.56,3434.903,Based upon --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3434.903,3435.593,His constitutional --
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.593,3440.681,-- the power of the executive and the area of international relationships and in the area of the defense of the --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3440.681,3441.591,I so assume.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3441.591,3443.148,Under the Constitution of the United States.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3443.148,3444.549,I so assume.
1970.1873,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3890.889,3897.008,"Mr. Bickel, this isn’t your case, but reading from Judge Wilkey’s dissent --"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3897.008,3898.006,Yes sir.
1970.1873,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3898.006,3906.702,"-- when I say harm, I mean the death of soldiers, the destruction of alliances, the greatly increased difficulty of negotiation with our enemies."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,3915.099,3919.308,"Not entirely, Mr. Justice Blackmun, for example the death of soldiers."
1970.1873,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3990.816,4013.563,"You know these records better than I do, but again going back to Judge Wilkey, he says, “but on careful detailed study of the affidavits and evidence, I find a number of examples of documents which if in possession of a Post and I repeat this is the Post case, and if published would clearly result in great harm to the nation."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4020.248,4026.717,"Well, I beg your pardon Mr. Justice, I am not familiar and I should be with the Washington Post case."
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4070.948,4074.634,"Professor, you stand -- you are contending for this grave and immediate or not?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4075.526,4075.894,The standard --
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4075.894,4077.195,-- futile for you?
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4077.195,4083.807,"The standard that I would contend for and the difficulties of words are simply enormous, one has to --"
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4083.807,4084.106,Surely.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4084.106,4087.965,"-- bring in to those mind an image of something, some event and try to describe it."
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4152.907,4171.703,"So you, I take it then that you could easily concede that there maybe documents and these 47 volumes which would satisfy the definition of top secret in the executive order and nevertheless would not satisfy your standard?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4171.703,4175.953,That would be chiefly for the reason that as is notorious.
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4176.928,4182.496,No and my question was -- let's concede for the moment that there are some documents --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4182.496,4183.267,Which are properly.
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4183.267,4185.68,They are properly classified top secret.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4189.863,4192.267,"That’s correct, Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4193.625,4210.617,"I take it, I don’t have and read anything in any of your documents or any of this cases which the newspaper suggest for a moment that there is no document in these 47 volumes which satisfies the, properly the definition of top secret."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4210.617,4212.119,"That there is no -- well, no."
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4213.715,4215.818,"Well you don’t deny that, do you?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4215.818,4217.013,I have no knowledge.
1970.1873,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4219.366,4226.982,"Well I know but -- so but your position must be then that even if there is a document or so, none of them satisfies your standard?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4226.982,4241.618,"I would say that today I had, if asked that question on the day we appeared, at the day I appeared before Judge Gurfein on a temporary restraining order, my answer would have been, I expect not, I trust the people at Times."
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4380.473,4390.921,"And your standard is that it has to be an extremely grave event to the nation and it has to be directly, approximately caused by the publication?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4390.921,4392.005,That’s exactly correct.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4392.005,4405.382,"And I gather then that your basic argument with the statutory or the regulatory definition of top secret is with the word “could” because that definition says unauthorized disclosure which could result in blah, blah, blah?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4405.382,4408.411,"Yes, I was addressing myself only to the events --"
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4408.411,4410.633,You would insist that it would probably result --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4410.633,4418.822,I would insist that for purposes certainly of any action in the President’s inherent power which is the case before us.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4418.822,4432.233,"Now Mr. Bickel it’s understandably and inevitably true that in a case like this, particularly when so many of the facts are under seal, it’s necessary to speak in abstract terms?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4432.233,4433.182,Yes sir.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4433.182,4438.799,But let me give you a hypothetical case.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4478.493,4482.183,"Mr. Justice, I wish there were a statute that covered it."
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4482.183,4487.42,"Well, there isn’t, we agree or you submit, so I’m asking in this case what should we do?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4487.42,4495.971,"I’m addressing a case which I am as confident as I can be of anything, Your Honor, will not find when you get back to your chambers."
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4510.346,4536.381,"As you know, as I’m sure you do know, the concern that this Court now has term after term with people who have been convicted and sentenced to death, convicted of extremely serious crimes, you know, that the capital cases and I’m posing you a case where the disclosure of something in these files would result in the death of people who --"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4536.381,4537.184,You are posing or --
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4537.184,4537.962,-- or nothing.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4537.962,4545.607,Your opposing the case of course Mr. Justice in which that element of my attempted definition which refers to the chain of causation.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4545.697,4549.118,"I suppose in a great big global picture, this is no --"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4549.118,4549.585,No --
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4549.585,4551.205,This is not a national threat.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4551.205,4551.38,No sir.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4551.38,4555.157,There are at least 25 Americans killed in Vietnam every week these days.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4555.157,4565.846,"No sir, but I meant -- it’s a case in which the chain of causation between the act of publication and the feared event, the death of this hundred young man is obvious, direct, immediate."
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4565.846,4566.865,That’s what I’m assuming --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4566.865,4566.903,That’s right.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4566.903,4568.586,-- in my hypothetical case.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4568.586,4577.366,"I only say as to that that it is a case in which in the absence of a statute, I suppose most of us would say --"
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4577.366,4581.692,"You would say the Constitution requires that it be published and that this men die, is that it?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4581.692,4582.035,No.
1970.1873,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4622.86,4623.712,Nature question.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4623.712,4625.562,"Well, no sir."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4644.581,4648.17,"Professor Bickel, let me alter the illustration a little bit, the hypothetical."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4688.359,4699.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, on that question which is of course a good deal nearer to what’s bruited about anyway in the record of this case."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4753.345,4771.109,"I get a feeling from which you have said, although you haven’t addressed yourself directly to it that you do not weigh heavily or I think the Courts should weigh heavily the impairment of sources of information either diplomatic or military intelligent sources."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4771.457,4773.033,Mr. Chief -- I’m sorry.
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4774.011,4778.528,I get the impression that you wouldn’t consider that enough to warrant the -- an injunction.
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4778.528,4795.72,"In the circumstances of this case Mr. Chief Justice that there -- I think it -- I’m perfectly clear in my mind that the President without statutory authority, no statutory basis goes into Court asks for an injunction on that basis, that if Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer means anything, he does not get it."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4795.72,4796.121,Well then let me --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4796.121,4796.53,Now --
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4796.53,4796.983,Make --
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4796.983,4800.947,"Where under a statute, we don’t face it in this case and I really don’t know."
1970.1873,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4805.177,4812.821,"Under the statute, there is a difference because the First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law breeching freedom of the press."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4812.821,4813.074,Well --
1970.1873,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4813.074,4817.424,"And you could read that to mean Congress may make some laws, breeching freedom to press?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4817.424,4818.839,No sir.
1970.1873,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4842.571,4848.887,"(Inaudible) argument for the times to be making, that Congress can make all this illegal by passing laws?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4848.887,4850.886,"Well, I didn’t really argue that Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4851.695,4854.539,That was a strong impression you left in my mind?
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4854.539,4881.527,"Well, I replied to the Chief Justice on a case that arose without a statute and far distinguished because its crucial to the -- for purposes of this case to distinguish between the authority which is here claimed of the President to act independently without a statute and the possibly greater authority of the whole Government through the machinery of legislation to act in similar premises of which I concede nothing that I don’t have to Mr. Justice."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4881.527,4888.456,"Professor Bickel, I have one question that’s prompted by this exchange."
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,4930.98,4936.526,"Well, there are some cases that are on this Court’s docket as you know Mr. Chief Justice for next fall."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5018.338,5026.982,"Yes, but the argument then is that the newspapers, newspaper reporters claim for themselves a right which this argument now would deny to the Government?"
1970.1873,3,15449,alexander_m_bickel,,5026.982,5055.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, I know there is an appearance of unfairness or unevenness about it, but I think the answer that a reporter would make and an answer that I find wholly persuasive is that neither in this case nor in a case like Caldwell does the New York Times or does a reporter claim something for himself, but rather that the claim is made in order to vindicate the First Amendment and those interests which that great document serves."
1970.1873,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5055.771,5063.118,Thank you.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5078.217,5099.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, General Griswold, Mr. Bickel, I think it might be helpful if I address my attention to the facts which lie behind these cases or this case, the Washington Post case as it comes before Your Honors."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5218.356,5219.783,Before you proceed Mr. Gendon --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5219.783,5219.958,Yes sir.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5219.958,5223.046,-- you agree that that is the proper test?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5223.046,5225.396,"I think that’s a proper test Your Honor, yes."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5242.781,5245.991,"And then would you repeat the words, so that I’ll have them in mind?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5245.991,5257.705,"So prejudiced, so prejudiced the defense interests of the United States result in such irreparable injury to the United States as would justify restraining the publications."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5257.705,5265.594,"And that would not cover the simple death, say of a hundred or 200 young men?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5265.594,5271.898,"Well, Your Honor let’s say, that’s a hard case, obviously."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5280.287,5283.672,Well we have a lot of things under seal that I don’t want to have and --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5283.672,5283.853,Yes and I’m --
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5283.853,5285.429,I’ve seen some off but haven’t --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5285.429,5306.521,"I’m going to address myself to those, Your Honor, and I’m going to point out as the best I can within the limits here and as did other Courts and the Government has not yet brought anything like that case to Your Honors, nothing like it and what we have heard, Your Honor, is much more in the nature of conjecture and surmise."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5306.521,5330.596,"Can anyone know in any circumstance the consequences of disclosure of sources of information for example, the upsetting of negotiations if that were hypothetically true in Paris or possible negotiations that we don’t know anything about, for the release of war prisoners, that sort of thing."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5351.788,5364.471,"Your Honor, I think if we are to place possibilities or conjecture against suspension or abridgment of the First Amendment, the answer is obvious."
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5654.981,5659.695,Does the record show how long the Post had these documents in his possession.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5659.695,5664.685,"How long it is -- in his possession, it does not show Your Honor."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5664.685,5672.489,"Does it show, if you know how long when there are times have the documents in their possession before the Post got it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5672.489,5685.093,"The record in our case does not show that Your Honor, but I have read and perhaps this gentleman, Mr. Bickel can answer that and I understood they had it in their possession for some months or month or two."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5685.093,5687.818,"I got that impression somewhere, three to four months."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5687.818,5689.443,Yes.
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5689.443,5692.551,I don’t believe it’s in the record.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5692.551,5705.839,"It is not in the record, but that’s my best answer to that."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5737.146,5748.814,"Of course it could be that something classified in 1965 and properly but be no longer subject to classification or even 69 or 70, isn't that true?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5748.814,5757.595,"That is correct, Your Honor and furthermore, some of these documents were classified, go back of course to 1945, the documents of that ancient."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5807.024,5816.715,Was there an order at anytime to produce all the documents in the possessions of the either of the Newspapers for examination?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5816.715,5818.904,The Government -- there was not Your Honor.
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5818.904,5820.68,Was there a request for such an order?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5820.68,5831.019,"The Government made such a request and because of the concern that the newspaper has as to protection of its source, the documents we were advised would indicate the source."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5831.019,5831.715,What you mean that --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5831.715,5833.979,That the documents that we had would indicate the source.
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5833.979,5836.015,"Who denied that request, the District Judge?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5836.015,5838.067,"Yes, and here is it how it resulted."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5838.067,5843.273,He left that override the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on discovery?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5843.273,5846.506,"Here is he resolved the matter, and I think he did it very fairly Your Honor."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5890.225,5899.0,"Mr. Glendon, I recall an ancient doctrine of equity that about people who come into equity and certain burdens on them."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5918.984,5923.663,"Your Honor, I don’t understand that that is the issue here."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5925.411,5928.606,"The issue, it say that -- it’s really -- it’s in this case."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5928.606,5929.066,This is only --
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5929.066,5938.185,"To the proceeding and there are certain standards about people coming into equity, coming in with clean hands as one of them and prepared to do equity."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5938.185,5939.503,We did not come into equity.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5941.114,5942.176,You were brought in?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5942.176,5947.353,"We were brought in kicking and screaming, I guess is --[Laughter]"
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5947.353,5962.245,"You are now in the possession -- in the position of making demands on First Amendment and you say the newspaper has a right to protect its sources, but the Government does not?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,5962.245,5965.296,"I see no conflict, Your Honor, I see no conflict at all."
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6124.375,6129.802,"Mr. Glendon, would you be making the same argument if your client had stolen these papers?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6129.802,6137.032,"I don’t think that the source, I don’t think that how we acquired on Your Honor features in this case --"
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6137.032,6143.618,"Well, then it wouldn’t make any difference, the leak aspect has no -- it has no relevance to the case either then?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6143.618,6147.578,I think it’s relevant as background because this is not -- this is the way that --
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6147.578,6149.403,"Well, then it would be relevant if you stole them?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6149.403,6150.766,I think so.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6150.766,6161.098,And you’d be making the same argument if your client sent an agent into the Government and stole these papers and then the Government attempted to restrain publication of them?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6161.098,6164.737,I just don’t think that the -- I don’t think that the manner in which we --
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6164.737,6168.048,Well that one is irrelevant as the other?
1970.1873,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6168.048,6173.546,Well it is because if the Government will leak 47 volumes at the time --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6173.546,6178.106,"Well, Your Honor I think if you examine the -- that’s certainly not true."
1970.1873,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6203.964,6207.603,What basis did it have on this case?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6207.603,6225.027,"I think it’s simply a matter of background Your Honor and atmosphere to show that this is not an untoward or unknown situation and when we hear about how our foreign allies or our foreign friends will be shocked or appalled or anything else, it’s something not so."
1970.1873,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6297.722,6304.324,"Well, Mr. Glendon, then I come back to you with the same inquiry I made to Professor Bickel."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6311.517,6315.474,"Well Your Honors -- Your Honor, that is true."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6374.577,6379.757,"This then really is, the issues in this case really are factual issues, aren’t they?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6379.757,6380.378,Well --
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6380.378,6386.505,"I mean, though I understand it and this is -- that’s my understanding initially, I haven’t heard anything really to --"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6386.505,6388.234,Largely -- yes.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6388.234,6411.653,"-- upon my understanding, you agree that an injunction could issue despite the First Amendment if it were shown, proved by the Government that there was something here, disclosure of which would directly cause a great irreparable and immediate danger to the country, you agree that an injunction could issue."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6414.651,6422.008,I -- they have shown nothing of that kind or by any other measurable standard that I understand could possibly be involved in this case.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6423.756,6424.735,So that’s a matter of fact?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6424.735,6433.038,"-- take the top secret definitions or anything else, yes, but there is something behind us too as I -- which I think perhaps is illegal issue and that’s the scope of the review here."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6433.038,6434.203,Scope of review of what?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6434.203,6435.454,Review of the findings of the District Court.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6435.454,6438.629,"Of fact, of findings of fact under Rule 52 A, isn’t it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6438.629,6439.419,That’s right.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6439.419,6440.596,So it's factual issue.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6440.596,6447.094,"Yes and there is one legal question, perhaps I’ll come later and that is the futility of an injunction here, but I want to --"
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6447.094,6463.621,"Well, then I think if you do a certain comparison, not a single document in these 47 volumes which is now entitled a top secret classification as defined in the executive orders."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6463.621,6465.447,No sir.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6468.914,6473.09,You said he has testified top secret standard or any other --
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6473.09,6475.668,Any other standard I’m talking about.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6489.083,6497.426,Well some standard as they are more specific by the test to top secret classification?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6497.426,6497.88,Yes.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6497.88,6498.559,That’s the standard?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6498.559,6498.847,Yes sir.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6498.847,6501.053,You would say a proper standard (Inaudible)
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6501.053,6502.001,Clearly.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6502.001,6503.166,By any doubt?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6503.166,6506.461,By anything the Government has brought forward.
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6506.461,6510.09,"By any doubt that these secrets, I wonder what specified --"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6510.09,6512.314,"Well Your Honor, the Government came in the Court."
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6553.365,6562.233,Do you agree that Judge Gesell would find the top secret definition he is going to ask?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6562.233,6564.156,"Yes, I think that’s -- that that would appear from his opinion."
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6564.156,6565.494,That's what he thinks?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6565.494,6568.388,"He looked at it that way from his opinion, yes Your Honor."
1970.1873,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6569.615,6571.46,(Inaudible)
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6571.46,6579.561,"Yes, I think that that fits in clearly to what we're talking about under the doctrine of Near v. Minnesota, yes sir."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6579.561,6587.032,"If the Trial Judge used a clearly erroneous standard, then the case is not simply controlled by facts, is it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6587.032,6588.498,Your Honor I’m sorry --
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6588.498,6600.93,"If a trial judge in these circumstances used a standard to judge the facts and the standard was clearly erroneous then this is not just a fact case, is it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6600.93,6608.942,"We’ll, I think that clearly as I -- clearly erroneous rule would apply to the facts, what facts he found in that points, Your Honor."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6608.942,6613.28,But if he used the wrong standard then it ceases to be just a fact case?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6613.28,6615.999,Well I fell that he used the right standard.
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6707.848,6713.617,"Unless the Judge Gurfein stated, they haven't used the same (Inaudible)"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6713.617,6718.34,I think essentially that that Justice Harlan.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6718.853,6720.086,"They did simply the matter of review, did they?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6722.649,6723.431,Yes that’s --
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6723.431,6725.818,They were reviewing any classification?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6725.818,6729.071,They weren’t reviewing; they were making an original determination.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6736.15,6741.346,There is de novo hearing on whether or not the publication would show.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6741.346,6742.275,It was a de novo hearing.
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6742.275,6746.027,"It wasn’t reviewing any classification by the executive department, was it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6748.482,6755.082,"No, it featured in the evidence Your Honor as to how the classification got put on because that of course is the bedrock in their case."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6755.082,6756.486,"It’s basically irrelevant, isn’t it?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6756.486,6762.8,"No, because the Government says and you must listen, they say, it’s top secret and that’s it."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6762.8,6766.068,I haven’t heard the Solicitor General say that here today at all?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6766.068,6767.826,Well that’s my understanding of the whole --
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6767.826,6774.302,"I asked him a question, he said there were those in the Government who like to make that argument, but he was not pressing it."
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6774.302,6785.211,"Well it’s the argument we’ve heard along that -- and you see that having classified a top secret, they move from there to show no proof."
1970.1873,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6785.211,6792.589,"No, it hasn’t, the Government has not in this Court made the argument that simply because it’s top secret, they are entitled to an injunction, they made that argument?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6792.589,6795.203,I was trying to say that having classified the documents top secret.
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6805.402,6829.296,"May I say as I understand the argument of the court below in the New York Times seems to me that they have pursued, they have argued it on the premise that First Amendment, freedom of speech can be abridged by Congress, if it desires to do so?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6829.296,6830.887,"I did not make that argument, Your Honor."
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6830.887,6837.739,"I understood you didn't, but I did not understand you making the other argument or your colleague?"
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6837.739,6839.262,No I do not --
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6839.262,6843.272,You talk about standards; I’m not talking about standards.
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6858.19,6860.176,No Your Honor I do not say that.
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6860.176,6860.97,You do not say it?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6860.97,6861.785,Never.
1970.1873,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6867.321,6868.99,I had misunderstood both on you?
1970.1873,4,44779,william_r_glendon,,6868.99,6874.886,"No sir, we stand squarely and exclusively on the First Amendment."
1970.1873,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6874.886,6878.211,Thank you Mr. Glendon.
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6886.633,6890.765,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.1873,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7050.361,7083.2,"Mr. Solicitor General, what particularly words made at this point, as I assume that there are not studies now are being made, in the future there will be study made about Combodio, Louse (ph) you name it and if you prevail in this case, then in any incidents that anybody comes about any of those studies, a temporary restraining order will automatically issued, am I correct?"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7083.2,7088.733,It’s hard for me to answer the question in such broad terms.
1970.1873,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7112.609,7120.39,"Well wouldn't we then be, the federal courts be the censorship board as to rather this judge --"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7120.39,7124.006,That's a pejorative way to put it Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7126.39,7127.685,That’s what I thought --
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7127.685,7128.274,The --
1970.1873,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7128.274,7131.581,-- a First Amendment violation.[Laughter]
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7131.581,7138.651,"Yes, Mr. Justice and we are of course fully supporting the First Amendment."
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7329.684,7333.266,I’m not sure I understand what you said.
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7340.356,7340.778,No.
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7346.351,7347.417,"Now, which case we’re talking about now?"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7347.417,7353.739,"I’m talking about the New York Times, this case is in the Second Circuit, and the Second Circuit sent it back to the Judge for rehearing with --"
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7353.739,7363.843,"As I understood it, there was no claim that Judge Gurfein didn’t consider everything that was then before him that the new matter was brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit."
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7363.843,7370.349,"No, the contrary Mr. Justice, the full 47 volumes were offered Judge Gurfein --"
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7370.349,7370.552,Oh!
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7371.194,7372.721,-- and he refused to examine.
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7372.721,7376.662,"Well he said he did not, he didn’t refuse to, he failed to."
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7376.662,7379.149,"No, Mr. Justice, he wouldn’t examine them."
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7379.149,7385.174,"He said he didn’t have time to, but he did ask the Government to -- please bring forward the worst and that’s --"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7385.174,7388.804,"No, I think that really came at a later stage in that case."
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7388.804,7391.037,And that new matter was brought to the attention of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7391.037,7404.713,"Was brought to the attention of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and they sent it back not for an instant hearing, but for one limited, properly so."
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7414.795,7427.537,"Probably the reason is, of course as you know Mr. Solicitor General that unless the constitutional laws that now exists is changed, a prior restraint or publication by a newspaper is presumably unconstitutional?"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7427.537,7429.311,It is a very serious matter.
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7516.859,7521.361,Well then -- and your brother counsel on the other side don’t disagree with you Mr. Solicitor General.
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7526.412,7537.469,"Very reluctantly, they were pushed into conceding that there might be some cases where there could be those suggested in the opinion --"
1970.1873,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7537.469,7541.721,Mr. Glendon said that he thought judge Gazelle's standard was the correct one.
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7549.716,7570.352,"Well, frankly I don’t think it’s much of a limitation to say that it can be enjoined if it will result in a break of diplomatic relations or a war tomorrow and as I have already said, we think the standard used by Judge Gesell is wrong."
1970.1873,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7570.352,7573.877,Do you think they are differ from the standards (Inaudible)
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7573.877,7576.928,Well I think -- I’m sorry Mr. Justice.
1970.1873,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7576.928,7584.428,"I say, do you think that the standards of Judge Gesell used were different from those which Judge Gurfein used?"
1970.1873,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7584.428,7590.339,I’m not sure what standard Judge Gurfein used.
1970.1873,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7662.539,7673.857,It’s still not clear as to the basis for your view that the case should be -- the District of Columbia case should be remanded.
