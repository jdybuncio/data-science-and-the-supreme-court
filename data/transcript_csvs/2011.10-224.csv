2011.10-224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-224, National Meat Association v. Harris."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,9.189,11.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,56.687,58.17,What about purchase?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,67.358,68.56,"We do, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.56,69.594,How so?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,69.594,87.706,"Justice Scalia, the reason that -- the reason that we do is because to the extent that purchase is -- is even relevant with respect to a Federally inspected slaughterhouse, I think all the parties agree that it occurs on or after the receipt, so it's part of the operational process."
2011.10-224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,87.706,88.889,What if it weren't?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,93.86,114.523,"Well, Justice Kagan I -- because the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the slaughterhouse and ends with sale, California I think could regulate and not -- not have its regulation be expressly preempted if it attempted to prevent purchase before the purchase occurred."
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.523,115.623,Or contract of purchase.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,137.103,151.696,"So long as the -- so long as the contract -- so long as title didn't pass, Your Honor, or the -- it didn't interfere with what happens on the premises from the gate through sale, then I believe that would not be expressly preempted by--"
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.696,152.279,Okay.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,152.279,152.546,--by Federal law.
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,156.498,167.556,"So your -- your position is if the contract for purchase is consummated in some way on premises, that's preempted?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,184.581,186.1,Not be expressly preempted.
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.504,194.289,"Well, your whole argument is on express preemption."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,194.289,194.739,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.589,197.658,You've given up any argument on implied.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,197.658,201.193,"Before -- we've not raised that argument before this Court, that's correct."
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.193,207.613,Please tell me why you think the sale of the meat is expressly preempted?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,222.856,223.906,Right.
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,223.906,225.474,It has nothing to do with sales.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,227.76,233.562,"Your Honor, sale is a -- it is a practical step."
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.861,269.087,"So how about there is a law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs or horses, or you can't sell cats, horse -- dogs or horses for slaughter?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,269.087,270.47,"--And Your Honor, I'd have to--"
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.47,271.337,Or for consumption.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,271.337,272.455,--I'd have to put--
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,272.455,272.972,Is that preempted?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,272.972,274.339,--It -- it would be.
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,284.43,285.88,There is a Federal regulation to that effect?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,285.88,287.549,--No -- yes.
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,298.857,299.99,And what's that definition?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,299.99,303.659,"--Well, the definition is -- it's kind of a roundabout definition, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,327.374,337.148,So the Seventh Circuit and -- and I forget what the other circuit -- was were incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could prohibit the slaughter of horses?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,337.148,338.182,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,394.318,400.155,Doesn't it seem strange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act speaks to an issue like that?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,418.117,421.302,"--Well, I would disagree, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,442.864,444.233,"No, I wasn't speaking of the California law."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,447.767,449.053,--Well--
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,449.053,454.957,"That's based just on a judgment, a societal judgment that this is an animal that should not be slaughtered and sold for food."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,458.825,474.919,"--Well, because Congress has made a different -- a different judgment, Justice Alito; and what Congress has said is: We have identified -- we Congress have made a moral judgment that the following species are amenable and may be inspected on slaughterhouse premises, and to the extent that the State is making a different moral judgment--"
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.919,478.989,And that presumably is why Congress excluded cats and dogs?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,478.989,482.191,--That -- Congress -- correct.
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.191,483.941,So Lassie -- Lassie and Kitty are no good?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,483.941,485.31,Congress made a moral judgment that--
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.31,486.727,But Dobbin is all right.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,486.727,489.528,"--I believe that's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,494.415,501.919,"Mr. Young, you suggested that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there would still be a difference because of ease of identification."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,523.852,530.005,They -- nonambulatory swine become nonambulatory -- may become nonambulatory in transit.
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.3,558.608,"But -- but I guess the -- the State could make it unlawful for a rancher -- or -- what are the people that ship the animals, do you call?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,558.608,559.941,Could be a rancher or a farmer.
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.941,568.297,"A rancher or farmer; Could make it unlawful for them to ship a -- a nonambulatory swine, could -- could they not?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,568.297,577.236,"Congress -- Your Honor, Congress actually has enacted regulations that don't -- they don't apply to slaughterhouses because, again, the scope with respect to slaughterhouses started--"
2011.10-224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.236,588.627,"Yes, but as far as this statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a nonambulatory swine, right?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,588.627,589.327,--That's correct.
2011.10-224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,598.516,604.47,I would have thought that your argument on sales would apply at the front end as well.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,613.809,621.098,"--Well, Your Honor, our argument about sales is slightly different, and it's a little different than the argument that's being made by the government."
2011.10-224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.376,671.328,"Well, isn't that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,678.934,680.051,"Well, no."
2011.10-224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,680.734,681.97,"One is a limitation, not a grant."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,681.97,690.076,"--Well, I think, though, that there were -- I think that -- the Federal -- what the Federal Government has done is established a requirement for the sale of meat."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,711.822,719.928,But -- isn't it the case that most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because of the method of transportation that's used?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,739.639,746.328,"--I don't -- Your Honor, the short answer is I don't know where those statistics come from and to my knowledge they are not accurate."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,748.095,763.707,"Do you dispute the fact that the -- that ranchers generally do not ship animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory during the transportation process?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,763.707,774.312,"--I think that is a fair assumption, Your Honor, with respect to pigs that present being nonambulatory when -- when the doors to the truck are opened."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,780.966,783.585,And you think it's difficult to identify which animals are nonambulatory?
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,791.957,792.64,No.
2011.10-224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,823.759,824.759,Would it be possible--
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,824.759,846.088,"Can you tell me, if it's okay for California to say you can't sell a nonambulatory animal, and that that applies to everyone off the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's basically your position."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,857.563,870.721,"--If I understand your question, Your Honor, if the -- let's say just for the shorthand, if title passes on the premises, if that's how it's understood in the industry and that's what it is, that would be preempted."
2011.10-224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,872.156,874.858,What a -- what a fascinating area of immunity.
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,882.798,896.038,"--Well, Your Honor, it's just -- I mean, I think the -- the real question is what has the Federal Government said about nonambulatory animals in general, and are those amenable species and may they be -- may they be slaughtered and turned into food?"
2011.10-224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,910.781,932.361,"--Does -- does that mean that a State could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop at the State facility before it gets to the slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check to see whether there are nonambulatory animals, and make sure that those animals don't go on to the slaughterhouse."
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,935.23,942.419,"Your Honor, the language of section 603(a) says that the inspection is to occur before they enter the slaughterhouse."
2011.10-224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,968.569,974.307,"Well, if they do it at the weigh station the truck has to stop at when it enters the State, that would be okay?"
2011.10-224,0,42227,steven_j_wells,,974.307,976.607,"That would not be expressly preempted, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,980.711,981.227,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,993.435,995.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1075.637,1078.189,"Well, before you get to that point, the animal has to be transported."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1085.027,1088.313,There are Federal laws regarding transportation.
2011.10-224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1150.287,1161.243,"Well, if the Federal -- if Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why should a State law that aims at that objective be preempted?"
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1161.243,1173.3,"--Well, if you -- if you disagree with -- if you disagree with me about the scope of the FMIA in that regard, the State law with respect to the handling of the animals while they are in transit wouldn't be preempted."
2011.10-224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1194.249,1205.355,"Well, if the State could inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more practical to do that?"
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1205.355,1211.092,"Well, accepting the premise of your hypothetical that the State could do the inspection on the truck--"
2011.10-224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1211.092,1212.294,Do you dispute -- you dispute that?
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1212.294,1214.377,"--I dispute that, but I'll accept that premise."
2011.10-224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.526,1239.778,So is there anything saved to the States?
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1251.669,1253.537,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.912,1305.97,"In that respect, do State inspectors routinely go on the premises of slaughterhouses to ensure that their coextensive laws are properly enforced?"
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1318.73,1330.537,I'm -- I am not aware that in general State inspectors or other State officials would go to the Federally inspected premises as a general matter.
2011.10-224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.89,1393.242,"What am I supposed to do -- I have a quick procedural question, which I think is similar to Justice Ginsburg's."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1413.372,1417.824,"Well, I would like to have an opportunity to take issue with your premise."
2011.10-224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.374,1418.707,"No, no, no."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1419.692,1419.926,--Yes.
2011.10-224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.564,1483.949,Do we have to peel this onion in order to decide this case?
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1498.526,1524.843,"I think the Court could, could do that, although I think there is some concern that if the Court were to find -- to have some concern with some specific aspects of the injunction -- and I guess I would let Petitioner's counsel speak to this -- there would be some concern that vacating the injunction so that it could be corrected would leave the -- the Petitioner in a spot where it wouldn't have protection from the vast majority of provisions."
2011.10-224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1524.843,1530.997,I have exactly Justice Scalia's question.
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1544.021,1545.771,"Well, I think -- I think the Court--"
2011.10-224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.771,1547.823,"I'd like to get out of the work, to tell you the truth."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1548.24,1570.838,"--The right way to get out of the work would be to understand that -- that California has made every effort here to implement a provision that -- to implement one underlying requirement, which is that it wants to tell slaughterhouses: Don't turn these animals into food immediately; euthanize them instead, and the rest of these are just ways of implementing that underlying requirement."
2011.10-224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1571.621,1572.938,Suppose we agree with you about that.
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1587.765,1590.967,--If there would be anything left to argue out below at that point.
2011.10-224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.967,1591.95,"Well, there are ten other parts."
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1593.217,1596.019,"Well, there are the ten points, but I actually want to answer -- well--"
2011.10-224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.019,1598.287,You want to give a one-sentence answer?
2011.10-224,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1598.287,1599.137,--I think I can.
2011.10-224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.511,1610.478,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1618.7,1621.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.996,1637.162,Who defines the scope?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1637.162,1645.602,"The scope are the mandates of Federal law dealing with the method, quality, and marketing of turning animals into meat for human consumption."
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.602,1647.602,All right.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1654.089,1661.112,None of the provisions are within the scope because California is not regulating animals that are going to be turned into meat.
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1671.733,1673.085,"Well, is that true, Ms. Smith?"
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1687.929,1689.229,That is correct.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.903,1700.319,"Well, no, no."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1714.329,1720.316,The humane treatment of the animals deals with animals in the connection of slaughter or while being slaughtered.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.722,1730.422,Wait.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1746.817,1763.659,"--Well, the language of the regulations, the Federal regulations dealing with U.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S. condemned animals shall be killed and shall not be slaughtered and dressed in the same facility with animals that will be turned into meat."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.951,1773.367,What about the--
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1773.367,1773.751,--and will be killed.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.751,1779.521,--What about the provision that says that they will not be exposed to sharp -- sharp instruments that can injure them?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1782.723,1792.579,"It applies to -- well, specifically the provisions in the Federal Meat Inspection Act apply to the animals that are going to be turned into meat."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.22,1805.672,"Well, wait, no."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1811.124,1812.542,--Correct.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.542,1819.913,And therefore it seems to me the preemption clause applies to the humane provisions as well.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1819.913,1829.538,"It applies to the humane provision with animals -- with respect to the animals in connection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered, with respect to the Federal Meat Inspection Act."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.334,1853.903,Just in slaughterhouses.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1861.307,1862.692,--Correct.
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1886.39,1894.896,But they don't -- you don't know whether they are going to become meat until after the Federal process of post-mortem inspection and all of that and your rules seem to prohibit that.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1894.896,1902.919,"Our rules -- well the ante-mortem inspection and post-mortem inspection are required of animals that are going to be turned into meat, correct."
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.358,1924.665,"No, but I mean your -- your argument up to this point has been that this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is for consumption."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1942.127,1947.698,"--No, because when an animal becomes nonambulatory it is readily apparent."
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1959.338,1978.134,"But that's exactly where the California system diverges from the Federal system, because under the Federal system you separate the animal out and then you take a look at it and then you decide whether that animal can continue to go through the process and eventually become meat or whether you euthanize it."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,1985.74,1999.23,"It commands an action, but it's not within the scope of the act, because at the very outset California is saying that these animals are not to be part of the meat supply system in California."
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1999.23,2003.534,"Well, but the Federal system has said maybe they should be part of the meat supply system."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2003.534,2006.569,"They may be part of the meat supply system, but it's not required."
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.438,2014.223,"But in any case -- look, this is a simple question that occurs."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2089.14,2090.423,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2121.075,2143.672,I understood that the Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal of any kind that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2175.126,2184.399,"--The distinction I would make, Your Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem inspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's meat will be wholesome and unadulterated."
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2200.175,2201.527,I'm having a hard time drawing that distinction.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2240.235,2241.952,Two points.
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2294.953,2313.117,"So I suppose what you're saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is entitled to take certain categories of animals outside of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, if you will, from of the scope of this chapter."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2348.79,2358.73,"Your Honor, if your question is, would that be preempted if California excluded pursuant to other diseases, it would not be expressly preempted."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.893,2380.559,"Well, it's an additional requirement."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2406.976,2413.666,"It's not expressly preempted because it's not within the scope, because California is not putting requirements on animals--"
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.666,2414.866,"You keep saying ""not within the scope""."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2418.334,2424.088,--Because the scope of the Federal Meat Inspection Act does not include every animal on the premises of a slaughterhouse.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.944,2433.628,"Right, and what -- what limits it?"
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2440.633,2452.457,California would -- there is no requirement in -- there is nothing in the text of the Federal act that specifies that States cannot withdraw animals based--
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.457,2455.976,"""No additional requirements"" is what the act says."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2455.976,2456.793,--Correct.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.499,2466.332,"Well, it doesn't say that."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2488.197,2490.399,--Because it's also within the scope.
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2511.23,2527.672,"So your argument is that because the act doesn't speak to whether or not cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can be sold as meat or not."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2527.672,2530.541,"--Correct, and since Mr.--"
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.541,2544.034,"Well, that seems to me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the difference is that the State law says you can't sell that as meat while the Federal law says you can."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2552.807,2554.107,--Correct.
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.107,2555.592,Correct?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2571.018,2573.553,"Well, the Federal law doesn't say you must."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.755,2580.124,We are not talking about conflict preemption.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2597.502,2603.156,"--Because the ""no additional requirements"" has to be qualified within the scope of the act."
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.156,2604.405,"It does, you're right."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2655.707,2660.076,"This -- Well, even if one looks at the subject matter instead of the scope of the act--"
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.076,2661.192,"What do you mean, instead of?"
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2671.734,2674.169,"--Yes, the scope of the act--"
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.169,2674.502,Yes?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2677.038,2684.025,"--Because the ""in addition to"" is qualified by on the --"
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2687.845,2696.582,But you define the scope almost exclusively by purpose and regulatory power is broader than purpose.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2728.236,2746.682,"If one looks at the authority given to the Secretary as well in 621, the authority is specified as dealing with -- or making sure that no adulterated meat or any carcass, part of carcass, meat food product, therefore is not adulterated."
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2763.208,2773.979,"Well, you seem to be assuming that in effecting its obligations that only when it finds adulterated meat is that within the scope."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2798.195,2800.214,Correct.
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.429,2826.698,I didn't see your argument and now I see it.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2865.073,2871.393,"It -- As I mentioned earlier, Euthanization it's certainly part of the operations."
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.595,2873.261,"No, I didn't say that."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,2895.274,2911.22,"--It deals with animals in connection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered, and so to the extent that that -- that slaughter is seen as an animal that is going towards the meat supply system, as opposed to one that's condemned and being killed and not -- not--"
2011.10-224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.22,2911.736,Okay.
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.503,2914.838,I don't think that's what within the scope means.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3010.467,3029.13,"--And as -- as I mentioned, the Secretary is given in several -- several different points authority to act under this chapter, and the Secretary's authority is -- is circumscribed to making sure that meat is not adulterated and setting up inspections--"
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3029.13,3037.201,--I'm sorry; you're not seriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate in the manner California has?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3047.509,3048.775,--No.
2011.10-224,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3049.711,3050.561,The Secretary could do that?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3050.561,3050.944,--Yes.
2011.10-224,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.077,3054.746,Because that would be a requirement?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3067.505,3069.655,"No, we don't."
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3093.204,3106.213,"But suppose, Ms. Smith, you decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in terms of inspecting for disease."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3124.842,3130.663,"Yes, we could because we would be categorically withdrawing the animal from -- form the process."
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3145.338,3148.624,But in fact it requires a parallel inspection system.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3161.098,3164.134,--In our -- our case or your hypothetical?
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3164.134,3164.836,In my hypothetical case.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3164.836,3165.186,In your hypothetical--
2011.10-224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3165.186,3167.636,And then I think that the cases seem similar to make.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3167.636,3174.275,"--Well, it -- it would not be expressly preempted, the hypothetical that you have given me because we are withdrawing these animals within the scope of the Act."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.232,3202.275,"The other argument is that it is within the scope of the Act because it is preeminently something that the Secretary is authorized to regulate, this nefarious diamond skin disease which we are all familiar with."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3240.55,3255.16,"--Let me be precise about -- if one saw, if one saw that -- that paragraphs (b) and (c) of the California law were within the scope, there is still an argument that they have to be with -- part of the operations, the premises, facilities and operations."
2011.10-224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.592,3284.996,Suppose I agree with you on that but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante on that and -- and disagree with you on the rest.
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3285.463,3289.567,We believe the -- the law could or would be severable.
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.557,3310.73,"What -- what purpose does the ban on buying and selling have, other than to implement the restrictions that go to operations?"
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3310.73,3313.682,"--Well, the purpose of the California law is twofold."
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3324.74,3335.929,"But that -- that seems to me to be the answer, that no, it doesn't have anything else to do because the animal cruelty that you're concerned about takes place on the premises as a result of the operations."
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3349.021,3357.477,"--Well, not necessarily, because the law -- if we look at the entire California penal code section it's dealing not just with slaughterhouses."
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.192,3407.227,What does it include besides swine?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3407.227,3414.881,"It includes cattle, sheep, goats and swine, and the preliminary injunction was brought--"
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.881,3417.933,But those are -- those all go through slaughterhouses?
2011.10-224,2,42022,susan_k_smith,,3417.933,3419.035,--They do.
2011.10-224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3421.819,3423.536,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-224,3,42227,steven_j_wells,,3432.525,3433.275,Thank you.
2011.10-224,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3567.428,3568.362,"Thank you counsel, counsel."
2011.10-224,3,42227,steven_j_wells,,3568.362,3568.595,Thank you.
2011.10-224,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3568.595,3569.714,The case is submitted.
