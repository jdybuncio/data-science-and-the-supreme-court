1991.90-6297,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.667,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-6297, Joseph Williams against the United States."
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,52.366,55.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.032,321.623,Do you think there is any indication in this record that the trial judge would have given a lower sentence if he had not considered the arrest record?
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,321.623,331.247,"Well, in his preliminary calculation he said I am setting the criminal history points at 10."
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.532,355.233,And the trial judge--
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,355.233,355.974,--Pardon me.
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.974,363.798,"--The trial judge also said that the court, too, is well aware of the fact that a prior arrest record itself shall not be considered."
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,363.798,364.079,Okay.
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.213,394.709,"Well, when the Seventh Circuit reviewed this it determined, I guess, that it thought the sentence was reasonable."
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,409.479,411.029,"No, I don't think so."
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.932,433.745,"Well, I thought, I thought the Seventh Circuit did not remand, that it found it was reasonable--"
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,433.745,434.286,They did.
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.286,436.247,--and it didn't remand.
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,437.358,437.128,That's correct.
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.869,438.47,All right.
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,442.391,449.898,"Well, the theory of it is they say, and I'll again answer that they have a rule, the Seventh Circuit clearly stated its rule in this regard and in its opinion."
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.731,505.122,"Well, would the Seventh Circuit affirm if it were satisfied that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence absent those factors, or just if it--"
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,505.122,506.224,I don't think they really considered that.
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.224,511.409,--or if it's satisfied that the district court would have imposed the same sentence anyway?
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,511.409,531.332,"I think what they're really saying, and I'm not trying to avoid your question, is that they would affirm it regardless of what the improper factor was or whether it determined in a higher sentence or a lower sentence if there were proper factors in their opinion that would justify this type of sentence."
1991.90-6297,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.924,558.371,Is there any need for remand if it is clear from the record that the same sentence would have been imposed?
1991.90-6297,0,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,558.371,560.142,"Yes, there is need for it."
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1364.387,1370.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.495,1592.185,"Ms. Wax, what if the sentencing judge says the reason I am departing from the guidelines to a higher level is a, b, and c, and both a, b, and c, or all three of them are bad?"
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1592.185,1598.7,If all three of them are bad that means that satisfies (e)(2).
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.832,1603.182,As a result.
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1603.182,1603.523,--Yes.
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.523,1604.524,That would satisfy it.
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1604.524,1608.836,And so we wouldn't go on to evaluate reasonableness in that case.
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.836,1611.648,But the other side says that that's what occurred here.
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1612.97,1617.042,"We disagree with that, Your Honor, and we think that the record bears us out."
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.501,1632.762,"Well, now, wait."
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1674.97,1692.682,"Well, we read as a result of language to mean in effect a but for cause in the sense that the judge would not have given the same decision, would not have given the same sentence if it had not, if the judge had not considered that factor."
1991.90-6297,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.671,1728.075,"--That's why I asked you my first question, Ms. Wax, and what you're saying now is inconsistent with your answer to that."
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1755.594,1766.049,"Because the result of inquiry actually looks at what the decision maker who makes the decision would have done, not what some other decision maker over here could have done with the same record."
1991.90-6297,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1821.524,1823.997,Let's assume we accept your argument there.
1991.90-6297,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1855.787,1873.149,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think that's the only value that's at stake here, and it's also important to point out that that value was much more important before the Sentencing Reform Act than it is now, because now it's possible for appellate courts to in effect substantively review sentences."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,2922.772,2924.922,I agree.
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.304,2928.655,"--I'm just trying to save time, Chief Justice."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,2928.655,2999.031,"First of all, you've got a case on the record right now, Misstreata, it's the only case that went before this Court on the sentencing guidelines, and the language in that opinion says the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 makes the Sentencing Commission guidelines binding on the courts although it preserves for the judge the discretion to depart from the guidelines applicable to a particular case if the judge finds an aggravating or mitigating factor is present that the Commission did not adequately consider when formulating the guidelines."
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.389,3020.266,I take it then that you... there is complete disagreement on what the law says between you and Ms. Wax?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3020.266,3021.358,I am sure there is.
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.358,3027.392,You say that convictions more than 15 years old cannot be the basis of a departure?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3027.392,3029.773,Here is what they say in the guidelines.
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3090.904,3093.976,"Well, it's not to be considered for the regular, for the regular level."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3097.179,3097.797,No.
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.608,3099.63,They're talking about departures?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3099.63,3100.661,"They're talking about departures, sure."
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.827,3133.991,"Do you think this particular question is within the scope of your, of the question you raised on certiorari here?"
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3133.991,3138.595,"Well, the sentence... the--"
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.595,3146.77,"You just, you posed us the question of whether the sentence must be remanded and resentenced if both improper and proper factors are relied on."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3146.77,3148.1,"--Well, that's the basic overall thing, yeah."
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.1,3149.742,"Well, that's the question."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3157.597,3168.356,"Well, I think if you read Stephenson, if you read Misstreata, there is no two ways that you're going to get this information in properly to determine an upward departure."
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.641,3174.951,Were improper you think?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3174.951,3175.552,--Pardon?
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.552,3176.974,Both of them were improper?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3176.974,3177.763,Sure they're both--
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.763,3178.855,All of them were improper?
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3178.855,3180.565,"--Well, not all, no."
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.813,3237.97,"Well, you know the court of appeals said that those, that those older than 15-year-old convictions could be considered, and you didn't challenge that in your petition for certiorari."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3237.97,3238.18,--Wait a minute.
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.091,3240.962,You didn't say it.
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3250.579,3252.448,"You mean in our case here, not the--"
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3252.448,3252.689,Yes.
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3256.362,3258.914,"--What did they say, so I understand what you're getting at here?"
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.914,3266.989,"Well, I just wonder if you have challenged, if you have raised that question... you didn't challenge that holding of the court of appeals."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3266.989,3269.43,That's the Seventh Circuit you're talking about?
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.43,3270.091,Yes.
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3270.091,3271.891,"What was the, what was the conviction?"
1991.90-6297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.891,3283.021,"They said, they said we cannot say that consideration of these two convictions as part of an overall assessment of the defendant's criminal background was inappropriate."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3283.021,3286.822,"Well, that's... they use those words, that's what they're saying."
1991.90-6297,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.793,3304.782,"You did, you did say, to be fair, in your question presented, when the Sentencing Commission has determined that arrests not resulting in convictions and convictions more than 15 years old should not be considered in determining the defendant's criminal history category."
1991.90-6297,2,33845,kenneth_h_hanson,,3315.882,3316.232,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-6297,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.281,3333.613,"Thank you, Mr. Hanson."
