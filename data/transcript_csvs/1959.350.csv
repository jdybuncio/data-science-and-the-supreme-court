1959.350,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,103.771,105.118,-- what would be the result?
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,105.118,114.806,"The result would be that there -- there would be no estate -- the insurance proceeds, in question, would not have been included in his gross estate."
1959.350,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,114.806,117.122,That wouldn't be in his -- his gross estate?
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,117.122,118.525,That is correct.
1959.350,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,118.865,119.892,No -- none of them.
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,119.892,120.851,None of them would be.

1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,124.284,125.244,That is right.
1959.350,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,125.694,131.885,And the reason is that it turns on -- on his relinquishment of --
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,131.885,133.522,What are known as incidents of ownership?
1959.350,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,133.522,143.833,"-- all incidents of ownership, including the -- the labor of relinquishment of the right to change the beneficiary?"

1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,264.52,265.267,I beg your pardon?
1959.350,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,265.267,267.412,(Inaudible) indeed the last policy.
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,267.412,271.008,"Well, the last policy was taken out in 1932."

1959.350,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,380.714,381.33,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,381.33,385.374,That was the basis of the refund which amounted to about $7800.
1959.350,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,556.035,570.624,Was any challenge to the -- any contention that the statute itself did not allow and did not cover this transaction which they say is not a transfer?
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,570.624,579.615,"At no time has there been any dispute, but that if the statute is constitutional, it does cover the proceeds of the policy."
1959.350,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,583.204,587.87,Are -- are they arguing that it was not a transfer and is therefore unconstitutional?
1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,587.87,596.606,"It is their argument, as I understand it, first, that there is no transfer here to be the subject of the tax, at least, no transfer at the time of death."
1959.350,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,610.932,614.44,What is the direct word on with -- of the statute?

1959.350,0,33753,kramer,,1027.698,1028.192,Yes.
1959.350,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1028.192,1043.781,Has this Court not held and hasn't defend the policy of the Commission to predicate estate taxes upon viewing of the taxation of the privilege of transferring property of death?

1959.350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.288,3312.189,Never been there before?
1959.350,1,26429,henry_i_armstrong_jr,,3312.189,3319.021,"Well, it had been a matter of regulation before that."
1959.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3561.903,3576.389,"Mr. Armstrong, may I ask you please, sir, is not that the case in every situation where a decedent leaves insurance payable to a specific beneficiary?"
