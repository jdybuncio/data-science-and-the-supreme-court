1968.6,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,46.889,Number 6 Joseph Carroll et al. Petitioners versus President and Commissioners of Princess Anne et al.
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,51.38,54.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.355,151.295,Are you going to tell us what did occur at the August 6 rally?
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,151.295,152.064,Yes I am sir.
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.064,152.381,You are?
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,152.381,152.455,Yes.
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.455,153.579,All right.
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,153.579,176.152,"Rule BB72 forbids the granting of such an injunction without a showing of immediate, substantial, and irreparable injury to the applicant before an adversary hearing can be held, and expressly grants the right to the judge to communicate informally with the person against to whom the injunction is sought or with his attorneys."
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.782,386.876,Why don't you think the -- don't we have to accept that the thought of leaving in a box was a reference at least to violence and murder.
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,386.876,388.068,Yes it was indeed.
1968.6,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,471.099,484.04,"Mrs. Norton, I'm not clear from or and I have read as for whether there was in the community, state of tension at the time that this rally took place."
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,489.291,497.33,"According to the record Mr. Justice, the last as orders had been in February 1964."
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.55,563.672,"Well, now there was also evidence that wasn't there."
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,572.112,575.635,Mr. Justice you mean two rapes recently?
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.019,589.813,"I thought recently that the speaker was asked not to refer to, and did not refer, but instead of that he talked about a 1933 incident which should end about the lynching, the last lynching in Maryland as I understand it over here in the eastern shore."
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,589.813,595.224,"That is correct and at that time he said to the crowd, â€œAnd I want you to know I'm not advocating that kind of action."
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.989,609.161,"Yes, and then he also told them about Chicago incident where a white people rose up, kicked hell out of the niggers, burnt 32 cars."
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,609.161,609.741,That's right.
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.733,684.547,Was I right in understanding that that case had led to the -- to a lynching?
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,684.547,698.37,"That case had indeed led to a lynching and these petitioners noted that at that time, there was shame cast on Princess Anne but that they didn't feel that -- but Princess Anne apparently at that time didn't feel that was such a shameful conduct."
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.37,701.55,"Just the opposite, they put stickers on that car saying they were proud to be of --"
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,701.55,702.602,Currently they were proud --
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.602,704.07,You're back to the lynching.
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,704.07,705.828,That's right.
1968.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.889,1078.356,"I don't think the indication was that the case could have gotten here in time in the Walker against Birmingham but rather that if the petitioners have gone to the trial court in Alabama and had been met with a rebuff or a delay, and then had proceeded to hold their parade, the case would have been presented here ultimately in quite a different posture."
1968.6,0,22900,eleanor_holmes_norton,,1078.356,1096.796,That's possible Your Honor but another procedure would have been just as much open to them would have been to somehow seek appeal here and they would have been uncertain as to whether or not to violate the injunction then or not.
1968.6,1,46671,william_h_zinman,,1636.061,1640.413,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.702,1927.062,"I gather the 10-month period was chosen by the court because that would cover the academic year of Maryland State College, is that right?"
1968.6,1,46671,william_h_zinman,,1927.062,1927.143,Yes.
1968.6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1927.143,1927.82,And I --
1968.6,1,46671,william_h_zinman,,1927.82,1927.988,And I think what --
1968.6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1927.988,1930.174,Which is the predominantly Negro institution?
1968.6,1,46671,william_h_zinman,,1930.174,1931.324,Yes sir.
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,1969.943,1972.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.6,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1993.957,2002.999,"Mr. Rottman, may I just suggest to you before you get into your argument that we have done in this case what we don't usually do."
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2009.543,2010.06,Yes sir.
1968.6,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2010.06,2018.576,And the reason we don't do that normally is because we run over and don't keep our cases within the calendar.
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2027.37,2028.404,Thank you.
1968.6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.462,2060.402,"Now, I would, speaking only for myself, we would suppose that you might well argue that under all conventional, and traditional and normal test, this case is moot."
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2063.806,2064.484,Yes sir.
1968.6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.484,2071.732,That -- I mean the 10-days expired more than two years ago and nobody is now heard so far as this record shows.
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2095.243,2102.857,"I think this year Your Honor, I think that under the Maryland rules, there is an absolute right to a hearing with two days notice."
1968.6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.814,2144.21,Two-day notice of a hearing not a two-day hearing as I read it.
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2144.21,2145.483,"No sir, they can have a hearing."
1968.6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.649,2160.386,Do you have the Maryland cases cited in your brief with authorities?
1968.6,2,41962,s_leonard_rottman,,2160.546,2162.518,"No, I have no Maryland cases cited, Your Honor."
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3422.098,3425.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3452.921,3458.515,What clear and present danger test do you point to talk about?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3458.515,3461.163,The fact that the atmosphere in this community.
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3461.163,3462.035,"No, but which one?"
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3470.806,3474.315,"The Shank case Mr. Justice, the Fire and the --"
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3474.315,3477.623,You don't think that the Denis case change that?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3477.623,3480.921,"No sir, not under these circumstances."
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3480.921,3482.415,Would you explain that as you go along?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3482.415,3485.498,Yes sir and I will try.
1968.6,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3750.042,3753.144,This was August of 1966?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3753.144,3755.642,Yes sir.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3770.887,3775.594,"And the rule established by Maryland Court of Appeals, you want to get it?"
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3775.594,3778.912,"Yes sir, I would hope so."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3779.197,3782.615,Was the proceeding based only in this statute at all?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3782.615,3783.197,"No, sir."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3787.886,3791.623,What was the threat?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3791.623,3798.64,"The threat was that any moment, that whole town and county could blow up sir as it had done in the past."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3798.64,3804.383,"Well, I suppose there is substantially against blowing up a town."
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3804.383,3807.138,"Yes, sir, but it was been a bit late to --"
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3807.138,3807.961,I understand that.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3810.384,3810.775,"Against malicious distraction, yes sir."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3810.775,3817.66,Did they refer in the statute at all for the people violating any law and holding a meeting?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3817.66,3823.555,They had not violated any town ordinance as such Mr. Justice.
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3829.335,3832.493,What about the streets?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3832.493,3844.864,"At this particular location, both of the streets happen to be stayed highways at this corner and the police, the Maryland State police were charged with the provision of those streets."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3846.016,3853.657,Is any state law against congregating on it or speaking on it or having meetings on it?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3853.657,3861.073,"There are motor vehicle laws against the blocking of the streets, yes sir."
1968.6,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3868.979,3872.769,But your injunction was not based on the blocking of the streets?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3872.769,3874.443,No sir.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3885.954,3893.866,"What the -- were there any ordinance, local ordinances or statutes directly --"
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3893.866,3894.005,No Your Honor.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3894.005,3896.682,-- on the basis of these observation.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3901.351,3902.437,Yes sir.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.122,3910.866,But under no ordinance or --
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3910.866,3911.952,No sir.
1968.6,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3919.519,3924.611,The -- I gather the officers had no difficulty preventing violence?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3924.611,3924.699,Their part --
1968.6,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3924.699,3927.144,The night of this meeting.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3927.144,3936.491,"Their physical present sir, in considerable numbers according to Captain Randall, it was the only that presented the riot."
1968.6,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3936.491,3943.421,And he reached to think that no violence the following night might not have the same result? That meeting in the following night --
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3943.421,3955.86,"The situation by that time Mr. Justice could have become so pulverized and so in the flamed that there were not enough state police to the State of Maryland to have controlled it, and that is Colonel Davidson's testimony as well."
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.86,3966.856,"I had noticed that your permanent injunction or your 10 months injunction is considerably narrower than the temporary, the ex parte restraining order."
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3966.856,3967.336,Yes sir.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3975.302,3979.119,But it was narrower in the kind of meetings that it prevented.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3979.119,3979.491,Yes sir.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3979.491,3983.61,I suppose this party could have gone and had meetings under these 10 months injunction.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,3983.61,3995.306,The second injunction as you indicate was narrower and that it restrained them from carrying on meetings of such a nature which would intend to incite racial strike.
1968.6,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3995.306,4008.703,What's your justification for the temporary restraining order where it is enjoined all meetings whether they would incite racial violence or not.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,4008.703,4027.742,"Because the -- simply because the situation was so inflammatory at the time that almost any assembly of persons immediately set off rumors, counter rumors, and drew others to the scene."
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4037.918,4048.259,I'm still puzzled why you don't discuss the Denis case which is much at issue of burden for the prosecution for the state.
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,4051.953,4052.241,The court possibly --
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4052.241,4057.109,Do you think it's just a communist doctrine rather than other than the one you have?
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,4057.109,4061.752,The reason I haven't discuss it Mr. Justice because I'm not familiar with it.
1968.6,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4061.752,4064.501,"Oh, I thought you promised me you were going to discuss it, I'm sorry."
1968.6,3,16281,alexander_g_jones,,4064.501,4074.183,"No sir, we -- the brief here and in the Court of Appeals relied primarily on the original Shank case and the cases --"
