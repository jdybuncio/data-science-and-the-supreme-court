2000.00-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We'll hear argument now on number 00-201, the New York Times Company versus Jonathan Tasini."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,9.022,11.808,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.00-201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.587,138.055,When you say people used to make copies you mean the ultimate user?
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,138.055,139.324,The ultimate end user.
2000.00-201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.324,149.529,"Yes, but the person who produced the microfilm or the microfiche produced the entire work."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,159.487,171.795,"As do we, Justice Scalia, in Nexis and in the CD-ROMs, the entire text with the exception of certain graphics that cannot be handled by ASCII is put in."
2000.00-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.795,176.264,When you would look at a newspaper on microfilm you would get the whole page.
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,181.668,195.077,"That's right and in this case you basically conduct a search under the algorithms that are used by Nexis, conduct a search of the entire periodical whether you call for a particular topic--"
2000.00-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.077,196.66,"But it's not all in one piece, is it."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,196.66,203.147,--Well it's in virtual... it's in... it's certainly not... it's not a newspaper that we're used to.
2000.00-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.135,213.77,"Well, but I suppose that it has removed the photographs and the ads."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,220.507,226.678,"At any one time, but with a very simple prompt of about 15 characters you can get the entire periodical."
2000.00-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.678,230.131,--But at least in let's talk about the Nexis for a minute.
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,238.052,238.654,You certainly can.
2000.00-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.637,254.08,"Now, I assume that the publisher can enter a contract with an independent author to cover the subsequent use in database material and--"
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,254.08,255.03,"--Yes, and for decades--"
2000.00-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.03,257.132,--Probably the publisher does that today--
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,257.132,257.866,--Sometimes.
2000.00-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.945,289.801,"--I notice, though, that the head of the copyright division has at least written a letter that looks like she thinks the court below was absolutely right."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,289.801,290.151,That's right.
2000.00-201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.338,339.668,"Mr. Tribe, does that view of the register of copyright relate at all to one effort that was made in the 76 act and to give the independent artisan, the artist, the author more muscle vis-a-vis the publisher or the patron than before?"
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,339.668,351.059,"--It's an interesting theory, Justice Ginsberg, but I've tried to imagine how by carving this pie into two pieces one could give the older, the other, more muscle."
2000.00-201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.059,353.594,One could pay that's--
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,353.594,360.581,"Well, in 1995, I was saying a minute ago, the New York Times said we're not going to run articles print only."
2000.00-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.494,434.296,"--So far as the future is concerned, Mr. Tribe, we're just talking about money, aren't we."
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,437.332,442.735,That's right and all I'm saying is there is not any particular reason to think the deals will come out very differently.
2000.00-201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.735,445.437,--But at least people evidently think it will.
2000.00-201,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,447.872,470.405,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that they think quite rightly that they can get a lot of money to settle a case in which, if we were to lose, we and many other publishers around the country would have no choice but to engage in defensive deletions of a lot of material that could otherwise expose us to massive statutory damages under the copyright laws."
2000.00-201,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1683.455,1690.959,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.00-201,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3520.404,3524.356,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
