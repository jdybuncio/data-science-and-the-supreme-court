1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,77.171,"Mr. Battocchi, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,77.171,80.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.722,512.556,"However, the government says that that is not a viewpoint-discriminatory on any basis established by the government."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,529.717,547.669,"Well, if I can take the first part first, Mr. Chief Justice, this statute does proscribe an acceptable and an unacceptable point of view: if someone stands in front of any embassy with a message designed to disagree with the acts or policies of a foreign government, that is proscribed."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.422,561.567,"But it is not enforcing a governmental point of view on anyone, not on the United States' governmental point of view on anyone."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,561.567,572.235,"The United States' governmental point of view mandated by Congress, is that views critical of foreign governments are illegal, but views supportive of foreign governments are not."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.194,649.975,But it does not prohibit speech anywhere else in the District of Columbia.
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,668.398,669.87,That is true.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.192,698.608,"Are you suggesting that the statute just prohibited a lot diff... a lot more speech, would be... fare, better under the First Amendment?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,698.608,699.877,--Not at all: no.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.779,718.55,Would it be more constitutional?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,718.55,721.622,--That is not our position.
1987.86-803,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.379,732.839,"Well, what if it just said,"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,737.563,748.89,"Then the statute would not be vulnerable on a... the basis of a viewpoint-discrimination or censorship attack, but the statute would, in our view, be invalid because of its overbreadth."
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.711,782.592,Each zone covers a different insult?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,784.334,789.166,"Each zone covers a different insult free government, correct."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.646,803.705,--That is not entirely correct.
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,827.882,843.963,"What you say is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, except that in the view of these Petitioners and many others who depend upon effective picketing to convey their views, if picketing is going to be effective, it has to be carried out somewhere where the message conveyed has some meaning."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.432,863.766,The Constitution gives them the right to have the most effective possible situs for their message?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,863.766,864.587,--Absolutely not.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.477,884.989,What Iranian violence is that?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,884.989,887.621,--This statute does not prohibit violence in any way.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.621,890.203,But are there not other D.C. statutes that prohibit violence?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,890.203,891.602,"Yes, and that is the question--"
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.602,897.118,"Well, does the government have to put every single prohibition possibly applicable into the same statute?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,897.118,904.351,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, but that is exactly our point: our point is, there are other statutes that prohibit violence and untoward conduct."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.476,993.881,"Is that before us, is that included in your Petition for Certiorari?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,993.881,1000.185,"--Yet, the issue... it is encompassed within the issues in our view, Your Honor."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.856,1007.929,"But do we have anything in the Record that goes to that, that the court of appeals passed on?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1007.929,1009.83,The court of appeals noted this in a footnote.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.83,1010.471,Yes.
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1010.471,1011.031,Yes.
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.831,1061.305,I frankly do not see which of your three Certiorari questions presents that issue.
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1061.305,1065.528,"Does it violate the First Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice, the first question?"
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.77,1072.892,Does it represent the issue of discriminatory enforcement?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1072.892,1083.448,"--Yes, as we read Kolender and many of the other ""vagueness"" cases, the primary concern in the ""vagueness"" context is the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement."
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.403,1306.745,Only in their embassies.
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1309.276,1313.999,"--That is true, but that cuts two ways, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.601,1373.468,But do you really contend that the statute... that your argument would be cured by a statute that prohibited insults in all media that are available to the audience?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1373.468,1375.898,"--If I said or implied that, I certainly did not mean to."
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.669,1379.962,"Well, if you are not implying it, why is the statute any better by suggesting that?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1383.104,1385.986,"Could you ask the question again, Mr. Justice?"
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.858,1389.539,"Well, Justice Scalia asked you about the discriminatory aspect and you said,"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1406.599,1413.214,I may have been addressing a narrower point than I should have: the insult-free interest is not legitimate anywhere inside or outside the zones--
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.214,1417.075,And would the statute not be improved by broadening its coverage?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1417.075,1418.237,--It would be made worse.
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.259,1424.262,"There is no ""equal protection"" problem here."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1436.27,1439.752,"That is not the way we read this Court's ""equal protection"" decisions either."
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.752,1450.838,"So you are saying, then, that this statute would be better if it not only prohibited the picketing with signs within the 500 yards, but also speaking or anything else?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1455.581,1458.332,I certainly do not mean to convey that implication.
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.402,1472.684,"All right, but you do not say,"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1481.7,1485.49,That is not a... major point.
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.49,1487.502,"See I thought you were saying (c), major or minor, I do not care."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1488.722,1492.225,I am saying that further demonstrates the irrational way in which the--
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.225,1493.357,So you are saying (c)?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1493.357,1496.987,"--I am saying that that is a fact, not a major contention, yes."
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.987,1498.85,It is a minor contention?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1498.85,1503.062,It is a matter on which... upon which we rely.
1987.86-803,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.062,1504.564,"Do you want to assert (c) or not, just tell me?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1504.564,1505.175,"No, sir."
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.201,1537.035,"Yes, but you cure that by saying, ""no signs at all"", and you say that is worse."
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1547.861,1551.254,"It is certainly an important one, but it... yes, we make that argument."
1987.86-803,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.195,1553.816,Do you make any other argument?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1555.468,1560.41,"--I would like to address the ""equal protection"" question just to make sure that there is no misunderstanding about this."
1987.86-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.414,1708.487,Did it narrow it or did it interpret it?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1710.839,1712.389,--I think it rewrote it.
1987.86-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.389,1721.315,"Yes, and you think it did not have the authority to do that, I suppose, is that one of your contentions?"
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1721.315,1722.136,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.277,1728.52,Even though the... Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia could have?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1728.52,1741.847,"--As I understand the unique system we have here, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is the functional equivalent of a state supreme court for these purposes, for purposes of interpreting a law applicable only in the District."
1987.86-803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1791.341,1796.074,Did you ask for a Rehearing in the court of appeals?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1796.074,1797.814,"No, Mr. Justice, we did not."
1987.86-803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1797.814,1802.108,And they did not go to a vote on a Rehearing sua sponte?
1987.86-803,0,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,1803.6,1804.73,"No, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.682,1809.753,"Thank you, Mr. Battocchi."
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,1811.365,1817.74,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-803,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.705,1923.839,"But Congress and the President apparently no longer have any interest in it, is that right?"
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,1943.661,1975.993,"Congress has delegated this matter to the City Council and has suggested to the Council that it reexamine the statute, but the delegation itself indicates that the obligation of the United States being performed here in providing protection into these embassies, the statute also indicates that the Council should seek advice from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State, and in fact has done that."
1987.86-803,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.026,2042.397,"It just seems to me to be a very peculiar way for the federal government to vindicate an assertedly vital federal interest to leave it to a city council to vindicate this enormous... this protection, for foreign diplomats."
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2052.983,2062.889,"--Well, the principal responsibility for protecting embassies in New York City falls on the New York Police Department."
1987.86-803,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.456,2083.603,Could New York adopt a municipal ordinance like this and purport to be vindicating a federal international interest?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2083.603,2092.149,"Well, New York has adopted procedures that are very similar to 22-1115."
1987.86-803,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.731,2131.924,But the federal government has not intervened to establish any procedures there?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2134.057,2139.33,--I am not sure of the extent of their involvement there.
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.613,2163.556,This is for the U.N. and all that business?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2163.556,2164.144,--Yes.
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.144,2166.217,"Well, that is a whole lot different from here."
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2166.217,2186.35,"Yes, it is different from this because in New York they are representatives in our country, but they are primarily to an international organization, while in the District of Columbia the representatives from foreign nations are representatives certified to this government."
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.405,2196.068,What is the difference in the federal interest?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2196.068,2196.745,I am sorry?
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.745,2203.27,Does the city have any interest other than that of the federal government in this law?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2203.27,2209.655,"No, other than the same interest that all citizens have in this country."
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.788,2218.221,Why does the federal government put them up to it?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2218.221,2224.715,"The federal government did not enact... I mean Congress, enacted this statute in 1938."
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.427,2258.446,But the Secretary of State sent a letter?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2258.446,2259.728,That is correct.
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.728,2260.999,And told them to do it?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2260.999,2262.509,"No, no."
1987.86-803,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.299,2275.97,Well I said that
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2278.19,2281.362,"--The Secretary of State is saying, ""do not change the law""."
1987.86-803,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.362,2288.335,"May I ask, when you refer to the Secretary of State's letter, he indicates that it is terribly important to"
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2305.189,2308.809,"I do not know of any, your Honor, but--"
1987.86-803,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.809,2312.082,"Then ""reciprocal treatment"" does not seem to justify the standard."
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2312.082,2321.378,"--I do not think that... from what I understand about ""reciprocal treatment"", it is not precise reciprocity."
1987.86-803,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.809,2328.833,What is the buffer zone in any other foreign country that you are familiar with?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2332.855,2336.167,"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question."
1987.86-803,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.167,2337.028,What about signs?
1987.86-803,1,23201,edward_e_schwab,,2343.904,2345.504,"I am sorry, I cannot answer that either."
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2696.904,2714.395,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.443,2820.453,But that is not this statute.
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2820.453,2822.096,"That is the statute, Your Honor."
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.096,2825.348,I thought this was an act of the District of Columbia.
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2825.348,2825.819,No.
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.183,2833.226,"And then it later was dropped, was it not?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2833.226,2836.258,"--No, the statute has not been repealed or affected."
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.941,2860.002,Has it been enforced?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2860.002,2861.893,"It is being enforced, yes."
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.893,2862.504,The statute?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2862.504,2863.463,The statute is being enforced.
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.463,2864.675,Who is enforcing it?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2864.675,2869.367,The responsibility under the statute resides with the Metropolitan Police Department.
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.367,2870.349,That is what I thought.
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2870.349,2872.409,But that has been true from the outset.
1987.86-803,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.933,2928.806,"Mr. Kneedler, K confess that I am inclined to view a statute dealing with this subject that is passed by the Congress quite differently from one that is passed say by the Omaha City Council, which may desire to protect a consulate in Omaha."
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2933.78,2935.141,And it still is a federal statute.
1987.86-803,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.141,2944.788,"Well, it is, but when Congress passes I guess what is referred to as a ""Sense of the Congress Resolution"", but which in effect says to the District government,"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2957.136,2958.996,I think not.
1987.86-803,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.157,3007.428,"But that certainly is an abnegation, at least, of any views by the Congress on the point."
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3015.543,3015.994,No.
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.771,3048.065,Has the Federal Government made New York City do anything like this?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3048.065,3062.454,"Well, the Federal Government has not attempted to do... what the United States does in New York is to cooperate with the city police in New York in establishing appropriate security perimeters around U.N. missions up there."
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.724,3067.296,Have they tried to make New York pass a bill like this?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3067.296,3068.588,"--No, they have not tried."
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3069.419,3071.47,Is there any reason why?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3074.181,3076.944,--Perhaps Congress could enact a nationwide statute.
1987.86-803,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.546,3083.839,Because they ride herd on the District of government.
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3088.85,3091.352,That is one of the principal reasons.
1987.86-803,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3121.013,3131.079,"Mr. Kneedler, do you think that the court of appeals has the authority to narrow the construction of a D.C. ordinance?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3131.079,3136.062,"Well, I think that... I agree with Justice White."
1987.86-803,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3139.784,3146.169,"Well, do you think that the court of appeals has the authority to narrow the construction of a D.C. ordinance?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.169,3148.62,"--Yes, and in this case we agree with the District of Columbia on this point."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.707,3177.979,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask a question?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3188.716,3192.569,Perhaps not in every application.
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.532,3232.904,"Let me ask the other question, then: do you think the dignity interest by itself would be sufficient to support the first clause?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3232.904,3234.056,Yes I do.
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.107,3239.96,That is because we do not want to insult our guests when they are invited here on a diplomatic mission?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3239.96,3241.442,--That is a part of it.
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.403,3261.943,Is the Convention essential to justify the statute in your view?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3261.943,3269.89,"Well, the Vienna Convention simply is a culmination or a codification of a duty to protect the dignity of foreign missions that antedated it."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.583,3275.726,Would it be constitutional to have a statute that said that
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3284.141,3292.075,"--I do not know that that would be... I mean, that would obviously raise separate questions."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3293.086,3297.529,But is that not precisely the same question that a person walking in front of the embassy with a sign--
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3297.529,3300.651,"--Well, I think Congress may well have that authority."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.094,3319.714,"--That is what I am thinking of, a face-to-face comment to the Ambassador."
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3323.556,3324.317,"--Well, it depends... yes."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.661,3330.552,"Yes, criticizing his government's policy?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3330.552,3331.032,--That is right.
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.474,3351.685,So you agree that is the same case as this statute?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3351.685,3353.045,--Yes.
1987.86-803,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3396.994,3402.947,It would not be violated by someone standing right at the front door and yelling insults?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3402.947,3410.914,"This statute has been construed to reach that, although there may be a breach of the peace statute that would separately reach that."
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.729,3436.46,Have any done so?
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3438.641,3447.006,"--Not in the form of statutes, but this is... the Vienna Convention refers to taking appropriate steps, not to be appropriate in the--"
1987.86-803,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.006,3453.6,"--But have any of them taken either of the two appropriate steps, one a 500 foot buffer zone, or two, no signs in front of the embassy?"
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3453.6,3456.612,--Not specifically a 500 foot buffer zone.
1987.86-803,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3607.461,3611.445,District Police do not enforce the statute.
1987.86-803,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3613.346,3619.989,"Well, Congress certainly has oversight responsibilities over the District police."
1987.86-803,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3639.613,3641.913,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1987.86-803,3,38737,raymond_d_battocchi,,3644.107,3648.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I have not made this clear, I would like to."
1987.86-803,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3724.918,3726.28,"Thank you, Mr. Battocchi."
