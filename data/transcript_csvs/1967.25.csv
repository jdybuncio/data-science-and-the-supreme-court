1967.25,9,33523,justtice_white,,1185.784,1187.245,Even if it's a negative oath.

1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1221.116,1224.732,This is all raised in the present tense to with me.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1227.02,1227.095,Well --
1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1227.095,1236.761,-- I'm not indeed in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1236.761,1238.453,Well that raises precisely --

1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1239.164,1239.936,-- one of the grounds --
1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1239.936,1249.81,-- that this is quite immaterial direct test but it's rather a resilient thing to require a grown man to say as (Inaudible).
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1257.756,1258.922,That's right.
1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1258.922,1262.666,-- the Government of the United States by force and violence?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1272.423,1277.059,"Well that's what the oath says and I agree with Justice Fortas, it is rather silly."
1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1277.059,1284.212,But you also have said that he is being required to say that he is -- won't engage in a subversive activity --
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1284.212,1284.295,Well --
1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1284.295,1285.697,-- that's not this one.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1285.697,1290.011,"Well, we say of course that the phrase “in one way or another” means subversive activities of course --"

1967.25,10,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1297.832,1314.608,"I suppose you can -- the idea of the question as this with literary product if it overthrow the government by poison, by dum-dum bullets, by machine guns, by --"

1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.89,1499.562,-- is that true?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1499.562,1502.155,-- that he has no authority to say that.
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.155,1503.715,"Well that's not for us to decide, is it?"
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1503.715,1504.64,Certainly it is.
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.64,1504.731,Why?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1504.731,1505.088,Just as in --
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.088,1506.275,A matter of Maryland law.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1506.275,1515.154,"Just as in the Sweezy case, this Court decided that it could not really tell whether the Attorney General had authority to ask the questions he was asking because he --"
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1515.154,1517.728,"Well, that's a question of Maryland law, isn't it?"
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1517.728,1518.57,Whether he has --
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1518.57,1518.978,Whether he has authority --

1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1519.524,1520.041,-- to do that.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1521.74,1524.889,"It certainly is in the First Amendment area, that's the Sweezy case indicates."
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.889,1526.019,I understand that.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1526.019,1540.059,"On the Sweezy case Justice Stewart, the Attorney General was authorized somehow, by the legislature of New Hampshire to make inquiry to investigate subversive activities in the State of New Hampshire."

1967.25,10,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1579.504,1580.081,"You mean, (Inaudible)"
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1580.081,1590.668,"First, we believe that the three-judge court was in error and their examination of the issue was certainly a very limited one at the time."
1967.25,10,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.668,1595.694,But they accepted the oath which was construed by the Attorney General.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1595.694,1605.311,"Well, they did accept the oath as construed by the Attorney General but only because of the decision in Gerende."
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1617.413,1622.762,Didn't you make the same argument in the three-judge court to making that?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1622.762,1622.988,What?
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.988,1626.429,Yes.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1626.429,1628.982,"Oh, we can't say for sure that he's utterly without authority."
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1644.65,1650.918,And you say the Attorney General did not have the authority of the three-judge court as he did.

1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1653.356,1654.888,-- the same term as the Gerende.
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.888,1655.633,My question is --
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1655.633,1656.233,Yes.
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1656.233,1658.598,-- is it true that you say they did not have the authority?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1658.598,1659.686,That's right.
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.027,1662.049,And the three-judge court said he did.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1662.049,1662.551,That's right.
1967.25,10,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.551,1663.409,Is that correct?
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1663.409,1665.696,That is in effect correct.

1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1815.737,1817.664,Well we didn't make much of a point of it --
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.664,1823.042,Because I -- because its my understanding that some -- the disciples of certain religions --
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1823.042,1824.789,That's right.
1967.25,10,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.624,1831.931,Is fine but it violates their religious teachings to take any kind of an oath even though on the witness stand to tell the truth.
1967.25,10,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1834.28,1834.579,Yes.

1967.25,37,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2297.936,2300.51,Applies to every employee in the State of Maryland?
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2300.51,2305.243,It applies to all employees except the laborers.
1967.25,37,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2305.243,2306.243,I beg your pardon?
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2306.243,2308.149,Except laborers.
1967.25,37,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2308.149,2310.013,"All, except labors."
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2310.013,2312.017,Laborers.
1967.25,37,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2312.017,2313.162,"Oh, laborers."
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2315.362,2318.131,That's right.
1967.25,37,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.131,2346.872,"Mr. Hawes, supposed an employee was a member of the Communist Party of the United States, but he was a completely passive, nominal -- their having been a determination that the Communist Party of United States, is an organization engaged to overthrow by force or violence."
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2359.329,2371.071,I would think it would be -- the question there as to whether his involvement in the Communist Party was more than just as you stated.
1967.25,37,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2371.071,2374.468,"Well, I'm giving you the -- I'm giving you the basis."
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2382.32,2386.339,That would not be enough under this Court.
1967.25,37,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.339,2388.352,Would he be sure of that?
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2388.352,2389.934,I think so because this Court said so.
1967.25,37,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.934,2394.497,"Oh, he's engaged in one way or another in the event."
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2394.497,2394.596,"Well, this Court --"
1967.25,37,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.596,2395.058,Is that (Voice Overlap) --
1967.25,37,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2395.058,2399.917,-- has said that this is not in the Elfbrandt case.
1967.25,38,33523,justtice_white,,2399.917,2407.719,And we've stricken out that clause to be a -- an oath that might have covered situation and --
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2407.719,2410.5,We struck out the evidence --
1967.25,39,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2410.5,2412.855,You struck out the knowing membership provision.
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2412.855,2415.085,Yes.
1967.25,39,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2415.085,2419.386,But you're confident that he could sign this without this conformity?
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2419.386,2422.236,"With that clause stricken, yes."
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2422.236,2441.734,"Well, as I understand the argument of your opponent, perhaps it runs this way that this statement is made pursuant to Section 13 of the subversiveness, Subversive Activities Act of 1949, is that right?"
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2441.734,2446.948,The particular oath involved in this case does say that.
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2446.948,2449.481,It's made pursuant to that section of the law.
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2449.481,2450.707,Yes.
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2450.795,2451.208,Is that --
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2451.208,2455.902,-- the form has on there -- apparently what happened was that --
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2455.902,2456.044,(Inaudible)
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2456.044,2462.028,"-- when it went to the printer, the printer left on that at a reference to Section 13."
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2462.028,2464.949,"Well, whoever left it on, its there."
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2464.949,2465.872,"In this particular case, yes."
1967.25,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2465.872,2481.227,"And the -- there you are in Section 13, now your opponent asks -- so says that the -- if Mr. Whitehill is charged with knowledge of what's in Section 13."
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2576.313,2578.464,I would answer that question in two ways.
1967.25,39,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2587.353,2589.73,Could you speak a little louder please?
1967.25,39,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2589.73,2592.206,Yes sir.
1967.25,40,33523,justtice_white,,2608.295,2608.751,"Well, would you concede --"
1967.25,41,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2608.751,2609.261,But secondly --
1967.25,42,33523,justtice_white,,2609.261,2619.689,Do you -- but you concede that if -- that Section 13 was at least in part invalidated by Baggett against Bullitt?
1967.25,43,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2619.689,2620.827,Yes.
1967.25,44,33523,justtice_white,,2620.827,2634.049,"And that if the oath really did require the professor to -- this term, what Section 13 requires in this term that'd be unconstitutional under Bagget against Bullit."
1967.25,45,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2634.049,2641.475,"If all the words of Section 13 were in the oath, that is correct."
1967.25,45,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2675.014,2678.62,"I know, but I don't -- we have before us is this case."
1967.25,45,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2680.434,2681.524,Yes.
1967.25,45,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2681.524,2684.947,And that does have the reference to Section 13.
1967.25,45,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2684.947,2686.376,"That's correct, yes sir."
1967.25,45,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2686.376,2700.343,"Or whether or not the reference to Section 13 is on a piece of paper that he is required to sign, is there any other authority in Maryland's state law except 13 for anybody to require any certification like this one."
1967.25,45,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2700.343,2704.38,"Oh, we say that there's authority under Section 11 and there's one under --"
1967.25,45,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2704.38,2706.262,Where do we get the facts in -- for 11?
1967.25,45,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2706.262,2710.292,Under 15.
1967.25,46,33523,justtice_white,,2710.292,2717.577,"On page 10A of the petitioner's brief or the appellant's brief, I think (Inaudible)?"
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2717.577,2729.272,"Yes, it is in the appendix, Section 10A."
1967.25,47,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.911,2763.985,Of course the statement under Section 11 is only an aid of the termination whether that he was a subversive person.
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2763.985,2767.527,"That's correct, but a subversive person --"
1967.25,47,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.527,2773.005,"Well, how we -- only further along under 11 on the (Inaudible)."
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2773.005,2775.675,"Because, first --"
1967.25,47,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.675,2783.371,"That's -- that the only authority for the statement at all is in aid of a determination whether he's a subversive person, is that right?"
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2785.915,2789.702,"That's right, for an applicant."
1967.25,47,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.702,2795.386,"Mr. Hawes, is that -- this reference in Section 13 is still on defense?"
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2795.386,2796.634,No.
1967.25,47,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.634,2799.018,Then he's taken the oath.
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2799.018,2802.547,At that time it was brought up in this case.
1967.25,47,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.547,2802.973,When was that?
1967.25,47,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.973,2804.291,(Inaudible)
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2804.291,2810.928,It would have been at the time of the argument.
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2814.266,2827.034,You may find it (Inaudible).
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,2828.295,2830.645,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2995.375,3004.495,Where is the direct power of the Attorney General to make rules and regulations that are binding upon any officer of the state?
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3004.495,3004.871,"Well, the --"
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.871,3006.343,Or employee?
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3006.343,3013.309,The oath here is not prescribed in that manner Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3013.309,3013.779,"No, but that --"
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3013.779,3014.631,The --
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3014.631,3022.096,Do you contend that the -- he has a right to make rules or regulations for the department (Voice Overlap).
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3022.096,3024.261,No sir.
1967.25,47,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3024.261,3029.476,"But how does it -- that power, how is that power transferred to this situation?"
1967.25,47,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3029.476,3047.437,"Well, in the letter that is in the appendix to appellant's brief on page 18A, which is a second page to the letter from Attorney General Finan to Governor Tawes dated May 13, 1966."
1967.25,48,33523,justtice_white,,3101.85,3107.103,So the university took the Attorney General's advice I gather.
1967.25,49,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3107.103,3109.34,"As to the body of the oath, it did."
1967.25,50,33523,justtice_white,,3109.34,3109.867,(Inaudible)
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3109.867,3119.839,Except -- they made it apparently an error in having it printed with the reference to Section 13 which shouldn't have been in there.
1967.25,51,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3120.173,3126.711,But I take it that the advice of the Attorney General was never binding in any agencies.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3129.23,3131.128,It --
1967.25,51,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3131.128,3148.029,"But what I have reference that apparently it's a decision of your Court of Appeals, the (Inaudible) case, you're familiar with I'm sure where it says the opinions of the Attorney General are not binding, but are entitled to careful consideration of service guides to those charge of the administration of law."
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3149.6,3155.309,That is correct because only a court can bind the department to a particular interpretation of law.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3164.09,3173.652,I understood counsel to say that they were giving this oath in various forms throughout the state today.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3173.652,3178.964,This is not in the record and I have no personal knowledge of this.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3182.221,3191.699,"Now in this letter that he wrote -- that the Attorney General wrote to the governor he said, “In light of the -- he grant decisions."
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3210.091,3212.504,"Well, the Attorney General did here."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3212.504,3214.107,The Attorney General modified it?
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3214.107,3216.191,Yes sir.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3216.191,3226.162,"Now, does he -- where did he have -- where do you get the power to modify any law of the State of Maryland?"
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3226.162,3230.834,"Well, the oath isn't prescribed in that form by law."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3242.256,3245.207,Who made that procedure?
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3248.324,3261.808,I -- probably commissioner-personnel or the -- for the regions in the case of the University of Maryland on the advice of the Attorney General.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3269.003,3277.557,Well it -- it couldn't be the Secretary of State or commissioner-personnel because you say the offices advised him.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3297.079,3298.661,"Yes, they did."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3298.661,3304.722,Well they might have done it following the modification by the Attorney General.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3304.722,3306.766,"Oh, in other words (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3306.766,3319.914,(Voice Overlap) where is the power of the Attorney General to modify an Act of the legislature which says one thing?
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3329.355,3338.126,"Well, the -- let's look at this way."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3657.046,3661.261,"Mr. Hawes, just one more thing if you were -- have you finished -- had you finished?"
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3661.261,3661.344,Yes.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3661.344,3663.879,I just want to ask you one more thing.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3678.32,3681.902,"Yes, it passed upon a form which was larger than this one."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3681.902,3682.53,Yes.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3687.233,3688.434,Eliminating the --
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3688.434,3688.674,Yes.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3688.674,3689.481,-- words in 1966.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3689.481,3690.658,"Yes, yes."
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3690.658,3691.619,That is correct.
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3691.619,3700.436,"Now, is your Court of Appeals bound to follow the interpretation of the Attorney General?"
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3700.436,3702.009,It is not bound to follow it but it would certain (Voice Overlap) --
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3702.009,3714.6,So what you've -- what you have been arguing to us is premised upon the interpretation of the Attorney General and not upon the interpretation of your Court.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3714.6,3723.755,"No, because the portion of the oath which is now being used was approved by the Court."
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3731.028,3735.308,"In which may or may not be valid, wouldn't that be up to this Court to determine?"
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3735.308,3736.494,The Maryland Court?
1967.25,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3736.494,3739.404,Yes.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3739.404,3741.682,If they were still being used.
1967.25,51,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3746.807,3759.773,"Well, it might not be up to the Court of Appeals of Maryland ultimately rather than your State Attorney General to decide whether or not this certification is sufficient in compliance with the Maryland statute."
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3759.773,3760.199,"Well, if --"
1967.25,51,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3760.199,3764.25,"That's never been before the Court, has it, the Maryland Court of Appeals?"
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3764.25,3767.557,"That's correct, it has not."
1967.25,51,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3767.557,3772.521,The -- your Attorney General has advised that it is sufficient in compliance but as to what you've just told --
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3772.521,3773.243,That's right.
1967.25,51,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3773.243,3776.553,-- the Chief Justice that there's no way binding upon the Maryland Court of Appeals.
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3776.553,3783.167,What the -- this Court can be assured that the Maryland Court will find the law to be constitutional.
1967.25,51,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3783.167,3783.798,"Well, that's a separate question."
1967.25,51,34610,loring_e_hawes,,3783.798,3785.018,(Inaudible)
