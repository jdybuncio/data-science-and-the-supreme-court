1966.233,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.167,"James J.Waldron, Petitioner, versus Moore McCormack Lines."
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,15.511,19.224,May it please the Mr. Chief Justice and the Court.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.892,168.198,"Mr. Friedman, I don't quite understand you when you say this presents the question for jury determination."
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,170.548,174.672,"Your Honor, this was tried before a jury, it was tried --"
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.672,175.19,Because it was --
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,175.19,176.459,-- on the civil side.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.459,181.227,Because it was -- it was joined with a claim of negligence?
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,181.227,181.74,"Your Honor, that takes --"
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.74,183.569,"On the Jones Act, isn't that correct?"
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,183.569,185.616,"Yes, and no Your Honor."
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,205.239,205.384,Yes.
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,205.384,220.944,All maritime matters arising out of the same accident where the proceeding on the theory of negligence under the Jones Act unseaworthiness on the general maritime law or even if maintenance and cure with its different concepts of damages were all to be submitted to the jury.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.944,229.23,"Well, I understand that and that's accepted but that's because basically that the Jones Act was joined, isn't it, the Jones Act cause of action?"
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,229.23,231.559,"Yes I would say that, yes and no in this instance --"
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.559,234.906,"You wouldn't quarrel, would you or would you that -- so that I can be clear."
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,243.11,253.711,"Right, assuming no diversity of citizenship, it would be purely an admiralty if brought in the federal court because it could be brought under the common law in the state court where you would get a jury and --"
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.711,253.904,For maintenance and cure?
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,253.904,254.925,-- it regularly occurs.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.925,257.426,I didn't know there was any common law right as to maintenance and cure.
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,259.54,259.683,We had --
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.683,260.387,Is that it?
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,260.387,266.161,"That was discussed if I may say in the Fitzgerald briefs, but I think the law is to that effect."
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.748,276.832,Here I understand you've got a jury trial because you adjoined with your sea -- unseaworthiness claim and Jones Act cause of action.
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,276.832,276.983,The question --
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.983,281.919,"But now, the jury has determined that Jones Act cause of action against it, hasn't it?"
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,281.919,283.125,That's correct.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.972,286.281,Now that's --
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,286.281,297.3,"And if I -- I don't mean to be splitting heads Your Honor but I do want to point out that this problem has given very careful -- has given rise, it's a very careful thought."
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.268,359.377,"Or the Jones Act is simply basically incorporates by reference the FELA and certainly there is no right for unseaworthiness against a railroad, is there?"
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,359.377,360.732,"That is correct, but it -- in that --"
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.732,361.71,It's a negligence action?
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,361.71,361.856,Right.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.856,362.664,It's a negligence cause.
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,362.664,372.785,Which Chief Judge Lumbard raised the question Your Honor was whether the Jones Act doesn't in fact incorporate the common law rights of those men who worked in the manner that they worked.
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.093,376.164,It's --
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,376.164,377.61,-- common law rights --
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.61,380.424,"It's not a common law right, it's an admiralty right, is it not?"
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,381.526,381.638,It's --
1966.233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.638,382.728,-- you and I see what the issues are.
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,382.728,383.199,Yes.
1966.233,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,702.673,709.8,"Well, isn't that somewhat different from this case in that that was faulty equipment."
1966.233,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,719.257,739.849,"Your Honor, the distinction is this, that in this case in our Waldron case, the work to be performed involved manpower, what was holding up the load, what was pulling the weight and withstanding the forces of gravity and its inertia, were not here a rope as in Mahnich, but was men's backs."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,1563.047,1567.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1633.296,1635.573,Do you cite that as authority?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,1635.573,1640.053,It's an interesting observation Your Honor and I'd like to make reference to a little bit later.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1742.657,1760.204,"Well, there if -- I wonder if all of the members of the crew were diligently engaged in other pursuits at the moment and there were not enough available men to do this in a proper manner."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,1773.066,1775.783,But it was slightly out of the ordinary Your Honor.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1775.783,1777.401,To what extent?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,1777.401,1801.663,Only in that there was testimony by plaintiff's witnesses who were experienced ship personnel that never before in the docking of this vessel had there been any order which required the use of this particular chuck which was some 56 feet away from the place where the aft mooring lines were coiled.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2055.201,2060.735,"Suppose he had sent one man, would that have been -- would you have a different case here?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2060.735,2062.966,You would have most probably Your Honor --
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2062.966,2066.641,What negligence for unseaworthiness would you have a different case?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2066.641,2070.484,"I'm sorry Your Honor, I cannot see any distinction there."
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2076.92,2077.469,Yes.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2077.469,2092.905,"But I do not believe that you would -- that that would convert this fully, confidently, properly manned vessel into an unseaworthy vessel because the mate neglected to assign additional available personnel to perform the job."
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2092.905,2106.766,"Suppose the -- let's carry it just one step further to -- might be too absurdly, but suppose that a mate said, “Do it yourself”, and sent no one."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2106.766,2108.948,I cannot grasp Your Honor's questions because if he sends no one the --
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2108.948,2110.33,"Well, but then he --"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2110.33,2111.777,-- the job would not be done I suppose.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2111.777,2119.257,"When he wanted to -- well, suppose he tried, suppose it wouldn't be done but suppose he tried and in trying that he got hurt?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2119.257,2120.838,"The mate himself, Your Honor?"
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2120.838,2132.246,"No, no, suppose this man was -- supposed to -- it was misery for some members of the crew to do this task that was involved here."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2145.532,2149.746,I see no distinction under those facts with Your Honor's former question.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2149.923,2150.528,Yes.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2150.528,2155.968,-- merely to a claim failure by the mate to assign adequate number of personnel to do the job.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2155.968,2156.772,I see.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2156.772,2180.16,"Indeed, if Your Honor pleases, almost always in these suits where a claim is made that additional personnel should have been assigned, the plaintiff almost always testifies that he protested to the boatswain or the mate and asked for additional assistance but the mate or the boatswain told him to do it by himself."
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.86,2554.931,"What would you say if the jury here has found negligence at the end, and would you say there was no evidence to support it?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2554.931,2565.566,I made a motion for directive verdict on that ground Your Honor but I'm not sure that I could have sustained on appeal a grant of that.
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.566,2572.669,"And it would've been -- and it's based on the facts, they shouldn't have ordered two men to do this job?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2572.669,2573.728,That's correct sir.
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.845,2574.502,(Inaudible)
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2574.502,2576.717,There was more to it than that if Your Honor pleases.
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.717,2592.607,"There maybe but don't you then face the hazard of steering -- of steering this line in any case anyway of assigning too few or too many, if I were to be found to be negligent."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2592.607,2594.667,"That's true, if Your Honor pleases."
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.667,2598.386,"Well, then whatever, extra hazard, this is on unseaworthiness?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2598.386,2622.122,"Because if Your Honor pleases, I think juries are much more capable of dealing with a charge which is based upon a claim of fault in failing to conduct oneself in a reasonably proper manner."
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.926,2662.224,"Well, let's assume the mate orders two seamen to carry this -- with this rope on a dolly and the example that you have put in this brief."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2662.224,2663.296,If the dolly breaks down?
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.296,2671.514,The dolly breaks down and hurts one of them -- hurts one of the men that it's just -- and it was found that the dolly wasn't strong enough to carry the rope.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2674.004,2675.841,"That would be unseaworthy, Yes, Your Honor."
1966.233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.841,2687.298,"But if -- instead of telling the two fellows to take the dolly and the dolly's breaking, he just sends the two men and one of the men breaks, that's not unseaworthy?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2687.298,2691.775,"That is not unseaworthiness, Your Honor, that's correct."
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2725.16,2734.39,"Those aren't regulations in addition to specifying numbers of men, also specifies their minimum proficiency required, doesn't it?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2734.39,2736.078,"To a large extent, yes, Your Honor."
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2741.549,2743.106,"These were what, able-bodied?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2743.106,2756.004,"Well, they ran the gamut Your Honor from -- we had ordinaries, we had deck utility men, we had able seaman, we had boatswain, we had a carpenter, and we had a run of mates that constituted our deck department."
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.004,2760.426,"This -- at the stern, this group was a mate and what, a mate and a boatswain and three others?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2760.426,2760.815,"No, sir."
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.564,2768.313,One ordinary.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2768.313,2775.141,"Normally, there were would have been in the aft a mate and three able and two ordinary."
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2780.335,2780.404,(Inaudible)
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2780.404,2792.065,-- not only a superior ranking but it turned out they assigned a man who modestly testified that he was the strongest and biggest and most proficient seaman on the ship.
1966.233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2792.065,2793.864,Sort of a sea-going Cassius Clay?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2793.864,2795.658,Exactly.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2795.658,2805.037,"Mr. Kimball, in your argument just before Mr. Justice White's question, you mentioned Mr. Bamberger, the New York Times (Inaudible) --"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2805.037,2806.267,Yes sir.
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2806.267,2808.612,Were you answering him?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2808.612,2808.943,I intend to --
1966.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2808.943,2815.238,Or were you answering the counsel on the -- so far as the ramifications of this case are concerned?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2815.238,2844.057,"I attempted to answer, to suggest to the Court, and to some extent deal with the suggestion that's been made in the briefs that there would be some economic repercussions from a reversal in this case which the shipowner might avoid by hiring more people."
1966.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2905.182,2918.478,May I ask you -- is it your argument that a shipowner can be liable for negligence from the failure to have adequate number of persons to do a job?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2918.478,2920.14,"Unquestionably so, sir."
1966.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2920.14,2928.108,But that it cannot be found guilty of unseaworthiness for an adequate number of people to do the job?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2928.108,2929.218,That is true sir.
1966.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.677,2938.25,That is really the argument they -- that they're never be allowed for unseaworthiness for having an inadequate number of people to do the job?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2938.25,2951.802,"Provided if Your Honor pleases, the shipowner has the minimum number required by the Coast Guard for safe navigation."
1966.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2951.802,2961.086,"But what your argument is, is that if the Coast Guard rules are complied with then ship can never be unseaworthy?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2961.086,2966.562,Insofar as the adequacy of the number of her personnel.
1966.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.609,2970.198,Why is that?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,2970.198,2975.974,Well -- may I answer the question in just a moment Your Honor.
1966.233,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3170.574,3186.008,"Well, Mr. Kimball, if you were one short in this instance, otherwise, the facts are exactly as we have within the record, are you suggesting that you would concede that as to this operation unseaworthiness have been established?"
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3186.008,3201.725,"I certainly wouldn't concede Your Honor, but I think I would have to concede that there was an issue for jury determination as to whether this assumed shorthanded docking gang, one shorthanded docking gang was --"
1966.233,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3201.725,3204.086,Why -- I'm just taking one short and overall?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3204.086,3204.696,Overall.
1966.233,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3204.696,3209.477,"Overall, one short overall of the Coast Guard minimum."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3209.477,3221.685,"No, I think we could get over that even in this case because we'll assume, if I may that the one short was a (Inaudible), nothing to do with the docking operation, we'll assume."
1966.233,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3248.953,3255.556,But isn't that contradictory what you said a few moments ago or do I misunderstand you?
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3269.526,3269.71,No.
1966.233,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3277.461,3278.747,"Yes, I won't forget about that."
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3316.19,3319.409,"Your Honor, this question has clarified my thinking."
1966.233,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3320.544,3324.095,And now you just clarified my thinking in your view.
1966.233,1,45164,william_m_kimball,,3324.095,3341.814,My -- I think was dealing with Mr. Justice Brennan's question in terms of approximate cost and that there would be a jury issue of whether the shortage of the cook was a proximate cause of the accident.
1966.233,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3347.899,3348.532,I see.
