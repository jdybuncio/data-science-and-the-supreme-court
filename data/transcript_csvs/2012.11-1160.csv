2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1160, the Federal Trade Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,9.439,12.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.901,73.612,"You don't think that the grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their services that are below the competitive prices in order to serve the needy?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,73.612,74.631,--Well--
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.631,77.5,Isn't that inherent in the regulations?
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,77.5,85.087,"--I think it is, although for reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question about an anticompetitive acquisition."
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.735,133.187,Do you have--
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,133.187,135.32,--might very well displace competition in that regard.
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.32,138.555,--Do you have any cases in which we -- we slice it that fine--
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,138.555,139.757,"Well, I do think--"
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.757,144.81,--that -- that you are a state actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not for others?
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,144.81,146.11,"--Yeah, absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1160,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.65,252.264,"Mr. Horwich, you said in -- in your reply brief that if the Hospital Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within their geographic area, then the clear articulation requirement would be satisfied."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,281.933,305.399,"--Well, I think the key difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the hypothetical we offered in the reply brief and the statute here is that the -- the additional words “ any and all ” make it clear that the state is contemplating that there could -- the county might opt for socializing its hospital services, putting all of them under the control of the hospital authority."
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,330.616,346.792,"Just so I understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there would be a difference if the charter said the authority may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its mission, and if it said the authority may acquire properties to promote its mission?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,346.792,357.081,"--Well, I think it's probably in our -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's probably the “ all ” -- the “ any and all ” that would I think be what communicates the state's--"
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,357.081,363.337,So you think a general saying they may acquire properties doesn't implicitly say they may acquire all properties.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,365.953,366.639,"--No, I don't think it does."
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.086,421.59,"I assume that the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, the authority to acquire property, right?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,421.59,423.042,"--Yeah, it absolutely does."
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.342,425.744,"And we don't -- that charter is issued by the state, right?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,425.744,426.861,--It is issued by the state.
2012.11-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.861,432.647,"And we don't -- we don't think that that enables all corporations to ignore the Sherman Act, do we?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,432.647,433.314,"No, we don't."
2012.11-1160,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.337,445.055,"Mr. Horwich, could I just -- before you give examples, just make sure I understand your basic position."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,476.093,481.58,"--I -- I think the defense would be available if the beginning of your hypothetical was kind of quoting the statute, yes."
2012.11-1160,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,481.58,481.93,Yes.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,491.02,502.244,"Well, certainly, the hospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what it's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a displacement of competition that the state has expressly put on the table."
2012.11-1160,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,504.428,509.732,What I'm trying to get at is the state has put it on the table only as a completely discretionary action.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,524.491,526.193,"--Yes, that's fine."
2012.11-1160,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,535.899,536.865,So all of this language--
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,536.865,539.167,"--and having it exercised, actually, at a local level."
2012.11-1160,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,539.834,551.575,"--So all this language in your brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, all of those things really are not part of your -- your governing test."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,551.575,552.01,No.
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.645,634.262,"Well, what about the other?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,738.898,739.265,--Sure.
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.104,749.421,"Yes, I think I know that."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,749.421,755.859,"I mean, we have this concern -- obviously, we have a concern here that without -- and this is detailed very clearly in the complaint."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,768.084,771.886,"You are not understanding my question, I guess."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,799.936,811.344,"--Yes, and I guess that is what I'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that mergers are different because the challenged anticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by the hospitals."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.344,813.28,"I want to ask you, why are they different?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,827.706,828.04,Yeah.
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.04,831.992,--and yet probably would further the purposes of the statute by lowering the cost.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,834.977,863.713,"No, I -- well, I don't -- I don't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that is true or not, but I think we're relying on the more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea that, well -- you can't start with the premise that this act exists to pursue an objective and to pursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it displaces competition in the market for paid health care services, without regard to whether it displaces competition for quality among these hospitals."
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,897.969,902.004,"--Well, you've already told us that it can be State action for some purposes and not others."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,902.004,902.404,Exactly.
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,902.404,911.377,"So the fact that you have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest that you prevail with respect to another one of the powers that are granted."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,911.377,913.396,"No, I agree with that, that it doesn't categorically."
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,933.559,935.425,This may be completely wrong.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,967.696,972.85,"Well, no, because I think the baseline when the statute was enacted was that the hospital authorities didn't even exist."
2012.11-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.11,996.3,"Well, but to follow the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that there were many rural counties, rural areas in Georgia very much like this one."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1001.953,1009.725,I think you'd have to imagine a very stylized hypothetical to see that the State had clearly intended to displace competition.
2012.11-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.761,1015.463,"Well, I know Georgia has 158 counties or something."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1015.463,1015.846,--Right.
2012.11-1160,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.846,1019.331,So I think they probably have many rural areas with one or two hospitals.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1020.615,1029.104,"Well, right, but I suppose that the guesswork is not going to be a basis for saying a State has clearly intended to displace competition."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.364,1072.316,"--What does the words mean,"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1077.537,1077.954,"--Well, I think the--"
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.954,1079.62,Which follow the words
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1086.642,1089.109,"--Well, I guess I'm not sure where Your Honor is looking."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.296,1097.665,"I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1103.117,1103.652,--Right.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.294,1143.827,Tying.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1143.827,1144.694,That's what a network is.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1145.612,1148.181,"A network is tying products, to tie products."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1148.181,1148.431,"Yes, exactly right."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.204,1159.988,And that falls within the words “ to acquire and operate projects ”.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1159.988,1160.888,--It does.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1170.961,1181.569,"I guess that just adds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing mechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1187.306,1189.175,"Well, no, I think -- I think horizontal--"
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.175,1190.175,At what point--
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1190.175,1209.236,"--generally horizontal agreements, I think you -- so the contracting power doesn't -- doesn't allow the hospital authority to go -- I don't think the hospital here could any more merge with Palmyra than it could go enter into a contract with Palmyra that says, hey, we are going to, you know, fix the prices that we--"
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.236,1234.12,"And can't -- in other words, the two hospitals in the town, when they say the price here, you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, you would then proceed against them for that?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1234.12,1235.72,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.489,1243.742,"And would you also do the same if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone, a local telephone regulator--"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1243.742,1244.325,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1244.992,1255.467,"--or gas pipeline regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said, our prices are -- you're to file tariffs and the tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in committee; and that would also fall within the antitrust laws?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1255.467,1258.319,"--No, I think those would likely be very different."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.602,1259.935,How is that?
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1259.935,1260.454,--the point.
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.206,1298.562,"Well, the language is awfully similar to what you find in public utility statutes: To set reasonable rates, to be certain that nobody is higher than a reasonable rate."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1298.562,1308.418,"--Well, the authority does not have the power to -- Justice Breyer, the authority does not have the power to establish rates at private hospitals."
2012.11-1160,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.076,1327.729,"What does it mean, to establish rates and charges for the services and use of the facilities of the authority?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1327.729,1331.617,"The facilities of the authority, yes, but not other hospitals within the jurisdiction."
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1355.149,1357.383,--Could you define “ necessity ” as you use it?
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1367.373,1367.923,--Right.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1369.006,1369.592,We don't make that judgment.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1369.592,1371.158,"No, it's not a normative judgment."
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.158,1371.908,The state makes that judgment.
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1372.277,1372.794,Correct.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1372.794,1383.55,"And in your answer, you conceded that whether -- if there is discretion, it's not necessary to make it work because the authority can say yes or no--"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1383.55,1384.002,Exactly.
2012.11-1160,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1384.002,1386.518,--So what's your definition of “ necessity ”?
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1386.518,1393.108,"Our definition -- our definition -- well, I have to be honest with you, it's hard to define it because it's going to arise in a number of different contexts."
2012.11-1160,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1465.137,1483.099,"If the state legislature articulates clearly and expresses affirmatively that it wants municipalities to share the state's antitrust immunity, is that sufficient, or is there a degree of specificity that's necessary as to the particular anticompetitive conduct that the state wants to cover?"
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1483.099,1493.104,"--Well, I think in your hypothetical we are imagining kind of a municipality enabling act that just has, you know, a section in it that says: Municipalities shall enjoy the state's exemption--"
2012.11-1160,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1493.104,1494.373,"Well, that's what's here."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1494.373,1494.939,--Yes.
2012.11-1160,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1542.685,1549.941,"Well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's consistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a grant of discretionary authority."
2012.11-1160,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1549.941,1561.265,"Well, I was assuming in Justice Kagan's hypothetical that we had some of the other things going on here that manifested a particular objective that the state was trying to pursue."
2012.11-1160,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.039,1573.556,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1581.162,1583.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.166,1673.688,"Well, I don't see how any of that pertains to whether they can create a hospital monopoly."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1679.242,1695.751,I guess my point here is that the legislature's -- the powers that the legislature has given hospital authorities are not by any means general corporate powers.
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.655,1709.011,"Well, but the only respect relevant here is -- the only respect relevant is the ability to acquire other hospitals."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1709.011,1709.728,That's right.
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.511,1713.713,And that's -- and that's a general corporate power.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1720.503,1749.32,"--There -- there -- these -- these are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the legislature, and this is well explained in Georgia Supreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was decided right after Georgia amended its constitution, enacted the Hospital Authorities Law, was the desire to, the goal to provide adequate hospital services, particularly for the indigent."
2012.11-1160,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.32,1755.492,"Georgia wasn't so sure, because didn't it come in originally on the side of the FTC in this case?"
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1755.492,1756.259,It did.
2012.11-1160,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1790.647,1801.688,"Mr. Waxman, we do have a brief from quite a number of states, and the brief basically says: We do this all the time; we set up these local authorities, and then we give them powers because they have to act in the world."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1827.272,1851.038,"I have no problem with the amicus brief filed by the states supporting the FTC in this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the outset, on an understanding that what is involved here is simply a State authorization of creation of a local entity with general corporate powers and nothing more."
2012.11-1160,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.653,1897.851,Is it a fair characterization of your argument -- is it a fair characterization of your argument to say that the possibility that the hospital authority can use this general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent to the legislature intending that it be used that way?
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1898.868,1900.47,No.
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1991.73,1992.063,Would you--
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1992.063,1995.015,--is the natural way to acquit the statutory mandate.
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.015,2005.388,"--There is a problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take this a step further."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2021.082,2021.998,No.
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2022.482,2037.092,"And that, that step, that further step that the State intended to immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are trying to find in this grant."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2080.371,2086.357,"--So, Justice Sotomayor, as to your first point, our position is not that the only mandate is to serve the indigent."
2012.11-1160,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2160.489,2166.976,"Mr. Waxman, could I understand where you think this expressed approval is coming from?"
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2194.31,2195.027,Okay.
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.556,2265.14,"Well, a lot of States have that."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2276.698,2277.131,"--No, no, no."
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.633,2319.393,"Your point -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response to my earlier questions along these lines I think was the following: Where do they get their hospitals, these authorities?"
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2324.962,2330.665,"--They can -- I mean, the legislature permits them to be built, bought--"
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.665,2331.617,Do you know what actually happened?
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2336.002,2338.271,--You mean all of the hospitals authorities in Georgia?
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2338.271,2346.21,"No, I mean -- I now am in a county and suddenly I'm a mayor and I see this law and it says we can set up a hospital authority."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2355.733,2362.637,"The answer, Justice Breyer, I think -- I mean there is nothing in the record to indicate where all the hospitals--"
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.637,2364.172,I don't need to know all of them.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2366.006,2366.458,"--Well, let's take the example--"
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.458,2367.423,You may not know.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2367.423,2368.19,"--No, no, no."
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.464,2404.833,Okay.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2404.833,2413.502,"--establish an authority, and the assets, all of the assets and all of the operations of the existing hospital, were transferred."
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.056,2417.373,Okay.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2418.223,2418.556,Then--
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.556,2422.008,--Then he says this: I have been thinking of it the wrong way.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2429.431,2429.931,--Right.
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.931,2434.518,"These were a group of people that ran some hospitals, some municipal hospitals."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2449.277,2450.394,"Well, I think that--"
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.394,2461.585,"The fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others where they're anticompetitive."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2462.952,2463.302,--Yes.
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.302,2465.971,"Don't think of it as one thing, think of it as two separate systems."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2465.971,2474.56,We're not arguing that the Hospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities the right to regulate non-authority hospitals.
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.493,2475.762,"No, no."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2492.688,2497.775,"I mean, this doesn't say you can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so."
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.794,2579.26,"Mr. Waxman, I'm showing my ignorance."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2582.829,2585.381,You mean if it--
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2585.381,2591.518,"If it were -- if we were not to find state immunity, would the merger be subject to the rule of reason?"
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2591.518,2597.689,--I am embarrassed to say I don't know enough about Sherman Act laws--
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2597.689,2600.041,"I was embarrassed to ask the question, but I was taught to ask the question."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2612.398,2613.383,--Probably me sooner than you.
2012.11-1160,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2613.383,2614.267,--That's right.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2652.842,2679.41,"Because the point of state action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign choices of sovereign states, is -- exists not only to provide a defense -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the merits, it's to protect states and sub-state entities from the cost of litigating."
2012.11-1160,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2694.085,2699.756,"Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is whether the state has made a choice."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2702.275,2702.875,Right.
2012.11-1160,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.875,2708.845,--is our trying to find whether the state has made a choice as to this kind of conduct.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2708.845,2709.295,Right.
2012.11-1160,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2709.295,2714.083,"So now we have your corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission isn't enough."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2747.537,2750.589,"I may not be able to convince you, but let me take another run."
2012.11-1160,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2833.41,2834.16,Mr. Waxman--
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2834.16,2847.92,"And they do this in a backdrop of a state that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate of need law that leads--"
2012.11-1160,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.92,2857.525,"--Mr. Waxman, you are essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets up the hospital authority."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2904.172,2925.002,"--I mean, I -- I -- I assume that the Georgia state courts could do that; but, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact, agents or arms of the state--"
2012.11-1160,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.002,2937.309,"But the question is, does this -- does this legislature mean that the state is transferring its immunity to this local unit?"
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2937.309,2952.653,"--And I believe the FTC -- Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe the FTC's position is generally, yes, but not with respect to the merge -- what is alleged to be a merger to monopoly."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.65,2978.403,"Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2978.403,2982.505,--I was taking a cue from Your Honor's last argument.
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.505,2982.988,I understand.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3047.081,3051.25,"Well, I -- for purposes of Federal antitrust law, yes."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.25,3051.533,Yes.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3051.533,3054.721,"--but for purposes of State law, almost certainly no."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.796,3075.198,We have no -- we have no idea whether they are willing to do that.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3075.198,3076.3,"--Oh, yes, we do."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.3,3078.017,And we have a Federal antitrust law.
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3078.017,3080.436,"We -- we absolutely do, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.634,3105.001,Why didn't it intend this?
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3110.621,3111.021,--Yes.
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.021,3115.275,"And now you say: But Georgia will say: Oh, no, they didn't intend to displace competition."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3115.275,3115.575,"No, no, no."
2012.11-1160,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.575,3115.959,Which is it?
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3115.959,3135.92,"My point is that, with respect to your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one hospital authority in Fulton County and they are authorized to merge in any event -- but could they acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so?"
2012.11-1160,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3173.728,3175.33,"And they -- they say on that, that it's a sham."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3187.805,3188.288,--Okay.
2012.11-1160,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.907,3299.311,Can the State -- does the State have a procedure where it can give real-time approval?
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3317.44,3318.556,Yes.
2012.11-1160,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.436,3337.853,"No, I know."
2012.11-1160,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3362.152,3375.609,"--I don't believe there is any such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State, the legislature, didn't contemplate anything like that, because the mandate and the responsibility and the authorization was devolved to the counties."

2012.11-1160,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3546.154,3546.604,Yes.
2012.11-1160,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3546.604,3554.61,You have lots of evidence that the authority does very little oversight of these hospitals when they move forward.
2012.11-1160,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3588.35,3588.767,Right.
