2004.03-636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,4.42,We'll hear argument in Johnson against California.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,5.573,9.371,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.331,97.504,"Is California the only State, to your knowledge, to apply this procedure?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,97.504,99.65,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is."
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.962,105.184,The... the statistics showed that there were... I'm sorry.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,121.448,122.767,"--Yes, correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,147.099,161.201,May... may I put aside for a moment the question of the strength of your argument in transfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of the original receipt of the prisoner for the first time into the prison system?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,184.978,210.363,"The circumstances in other States, which we've been able to identify, include a range of... of circumstances, which include... as is available in California under the penal code section, which requires the delivery of a presentence report, together with a commitment order, is analysis on a particularized circumstance basis of the individuals who are coming into the prison and making a... an estimate as to what may occur."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.196,238.764,Do you know if there are in these other States the same incidents of racial riots or racial killings or racial attacks?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,238.764,251.973,"Well, the best empirical evidence which exists that we're familiar with was reported in the Trulson study, which the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit petition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the amici have filed with this Court."
2004.03-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.868,308.982,Were there any incidents in California's prisons of same cellmates of different races having episodes of violence?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,320.787,333.586,"Justice Ginsburg, one of the interesting things about the record in this case is that the State of California has been unable to identify a single incident of a... of interracial violence between cellmates."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.509,343.821,"Well, they say that that proves that their policy is very effective."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,345.557,362.852,"--I think the... I think the record suggests, as at least in the testimony of Mr. Johnson, that it is a de facto segregation system which exists after the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day period, and so it would be hard for the State of California to provide... to provide that data."
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.852,370.488,Suppose you were to prevail in this case and a court were to enter a decree forbidding this practice.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,386.424,413.917,"Well, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me that under the Court's strict scrutiny analysis, which in my judgment should have applied here, and under the particularized circumstance test announced in the Lee case in the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single prisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not to give rise to a systematic change in... in a policy which is rooted in racial stereotype."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.489,435.465,What is... what is sacrosanct about the... about the constitutional right not to be subjected to racial stereotype?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,472.534,483.102,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the fundamental teachings on the Fourteenth Amendment of this Court demonstrate that race is different, that the government use of race is presumed to be unlawful--"
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.102,485.62,"Oh, it's... it's different from First Amendment rights?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,511.338,511.915,--Yes.
2004.03-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.203,523.309,"Well, even First Amendment rights."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,523.309,524.174,Even First Amendment rights.
2004.03-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.174,524.547,Isn't that so?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,524.547,525.456,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.456,531.112,"Which is a terribly important set of rights for individuals, is it not?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,531.112,531.855,Yes.
2004.03-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.341,533.713,Right.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,533.713,546.51,"However, in the context of incarceration, a sacrifice of the right to assembly, the right to correspond in certain circumstances, to contact visits are things which are well within the ambit of what a prison needs to control."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.51,547.048,"No, I don't think so."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,555.509,564.714,"And in... and in the circumstances that the Court's test has been announced in Turner, that's certainly within the ambit of a right which the prison authorities might properly exercise."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.714,566.284,And why is this not one?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,566.284,567.936,"Well, because this Court decided--"
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.936,577.141,"Because it... it is no... there is no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the Aryan Brotherhood and... and Hispanic gangs and... and black gangs."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,579.37,589.69,"--There's no doubt... Justice Scalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, but this policy of California is directed not to the gang aspect of it but to the race aspect."
2004.03-636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.658,609.63,"Mr. Deixler, do you think you lose if we apply Turner?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,609.63,610.995,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.428,623.709,"Well, why isn't that the right approach to the case then if that's the... we don't have to meddle with the rules governing the... the conduct of prisons, if you can prevail under that theory?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,623.709,628.743,"--We would... we would be pleased to... to prevail under... under Turner, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.499,694.464,"Suppose you have a population in which 50 percent of all the members of a particular race are a member of a... of a gang, a gang such as we've read about in... in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,699.126,701.456,"No, I don't think such a statistic--"
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,701.456,707.029,Is... is that because you don't equate race gangs with race animosity?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,707.029,711.198,"--Well, in fact, in part that's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,712.479,726.696,"And... because it does seem to me that part of your submission, or at least an inference that I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute race-based threats."
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,729.774,737.287,"--Without more, Justice Kennedy, that inference cannot be drawn, and I'll give the Court the example of the Crips and the Bloods--"
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.287,738.568,You mean the inference that the... which inference?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,740.138,744.679,"--That they are not to the extent that, Justice Kennedy, you're asking whether it is an interracial threat."
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.765,770.602,--assume that a gang poses an interracial threat?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,770.602,787.442,The... there's no evidence which has been produced in this record which would suggest that the policy can be tied from skin color to gang membership and from gang membership to interracial violence.
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.442,789.011,I... I asked... I asked about gang membership.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,796.896,798.382,"Not in the record of this case, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.382,799.951,--I don't... you... you don't need it in the record.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,845.155,845.565,Yes.
2004.03-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.565,846.269,Okay.
2004.03-636,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.269,847.384,What is the--
2004.03-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.384,847.756,All right.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,861.668,870.418,"I think on race alone, the prison system would run afoul of the Constitution in making that determination."
2004.03-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.963,894.24,"Well, would it be a proper analysis simply to... to separate or not based on gang membership?"
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,894.24,895.355,"--Yes, Justice Souter."
2004.03-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.355,895.605,No.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,906.008,906.462,Yes.
2004.03-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,912.073,912.611,Okay.
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,912.611,914.468,I'd like to reserve the balance of my--
2004.03-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,914.468,915.377,May I... may I ask just one question?
2004.03-636,0,17572,bert_h_deixler,,961.241,961.529,--Yes.
2004.03-636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.587,992.987,Mr. Clement.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,992.987,1000.789,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.708,1024.156,"We say the same about the First Amendment, don't we?"
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1031.874,1043.512,"Well, I think that this Court has recognized in a variety of contexts, including when they have... when justices have made reference to prison policies, that all government actions based on race are subject to strict scrutiny."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.512,1044.422,Unlike the First Amendment.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1044.422,1059.077,"The First Amendment obviously has been subjected, at least when you're talking about things other than outgoing prisoner mail, to be subjected to the Turner analysis, but no... this Court has never suggested that the Turner analysis applies to race."
2004.03-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.077,1064.363,"Mr. Clement, will you tell us how the Government would come out applying the Turner analysis in this case?"
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1064.363,1066.22,"Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.257,1104.487,And why should we decide the constitutional question?
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1104.487,1107.914,"Well, I think either one of those would be a constitutional--"
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.914,1108.164,"Well, it's--"
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1108.164,1114.518,"--holding of this Court, and I think either under Turner or under strict scrutiny, it's still equally a constitutional holding."
2004.03-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1174.954,1196.047,Is... is there an argument to be made that the reason we make that emphasis and... and an argument for you in this case that there is somehow a greater fragility to... to the effective standards to prevent racial classification than there is to the possibility of enforcing speech rights and so on?
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1204.88,1207.109,"Well, I think that's part of it, Justice Souter."
2004.03-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1222.259,1225.231,"Yes, but there's a pretty frightening history about speech restriction too."
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1225.231,1238.113,"Well, again, I think, though, that there is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving race in this country, and I think, again, it is completely wrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from that history."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.831,1249.463,--This is not a permanent segregation in these California prisons.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1251.692,1253.921,"It lasts 60 days, is the best evidence."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.921,1268.0,"Until... until they... they have assurance that... that the individuals are... are not members of a gang and likely to, in... in their view, commit racial violence if... if co-celled with another prisoner."
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1268.0,1268.948,"With respect, Justice--"
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.948,1273.035,"If it were permanent, your argument about this, you know, this is a long tradition of our prisons."
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1279.805,1297.805,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, in Lee against Washington, this Court upheld the integration not just of the Alabama prisons, but the Alabama jails, and the evidence before the Court there... and this is clear from the three-judge opinion... is that the average stay in the Birmingham city jail was 7 to 15 days."
2004.03-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.582,1305.068,"Okay, but we didn't announce a standard."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.068,1305.334,That was for the whole stay.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1305.334,1307.752,"Well, that's true, Justice Souter."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.613,1325.313,What does 7... what does 7 to 15 days have to do with anything?
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1350.022,1352.146,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, I disagree."
2004.03-636,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.882,1395.021,"One of... one of California's response said, well, the Feds have mostly income tax evaders, maybe some drug dealers, but the State prisoners are the real tough guys, the real violent criminals."
2004.03-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.325,1398.176,They have a high class of felons in the Federal prison basically.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1398.176,1403.021,"With respect, Your Honors, that misdescribes the... the population of the Federal prisons."
2004.03-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1495.901,1498.447,Why... why does that affect the Turner analysis?
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1500.137,1506.166,"What I'm suggesting, Justice O'Connor, is what the... the application of Turner to this policy allowed."
2004.03-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1510.419,1513.929,I thought you told us earlier it wouldn't survive Turner.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1516.819,1520.284,"--Well, it wouldn't survive a proper analysis under Turner."
2004.03-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.633,1561.688,You're concerned about evaluating prison race policies.
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1566.724,1577.376,"Well, I think... I think California... it's... it's best described as California is one of at most a couple of States that have a comparable cell-based policy of segregation."
2004.03-636,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.344,1594.837,Your--
2004.03-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.837,1596.861,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2004.03-636,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1596.861,1597.975,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.975,1601.524,Mr.... Ms. Grunder.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1601.524,1605.49,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.072,1643.551,Is there any evidence in the record that the initial placing of two inmates in the same cell has ever had... has ever produced a racial incident?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1643.551,1645.075,"--In the reception center, Your Honor?"
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.075,1645.818,Pardon me?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1645.818,1646.727,In the reception centers?
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.727,1647.554,Yes.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1647.554,1652.877,"No, because the... the inmates are not interracially housed."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.877,1653.332,You've never tried it.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1653.332,1655.932,"There's nothing in the record, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.561,1679.505,But it applies in the reception center area for someone who has been transferred as well as the... an initial incarceration.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1679.505,1682.106,It's a very shortened period for a transferee.
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1702.705,1704.357,But... I'm sorry.
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.374,1723.76,That's what I don't understand too.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1729.537,1731.578,"There's a... there's a couple of reasons, Your Honors."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.145,1755.915,"Well, unless you house them with the cellmate, what are you going to learn from segregating them for 14 days?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1755.915,1761.405,What happens when they arrive at the receiving institution is there needs to be time for a record review.
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1769.744,1778.661,"Well, if we have a choice between segregating by race and speeding up the delivery of records, isn't it constitutionally preferable to get the records delivered on time?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1778.661,1786.258,The records need to stay with the inmate at the old prison until the inmate leaves on the bus for the new prison because--
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1786.258,1786.508,Why?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1788.366,1793.317,"--Well, in the case of California, there's over 165,000 inmates."
2004.03-636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1801.84,1811.128,When... when... there's a transferee from prison A to prison B and he goes to the reception center.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1821.697,1825.412,--He may be housed with new entrants into the system and that... that's the reason--
2004.03-636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1825.412,1832.804,"So... so as to one-half of the people in that... in that instance, you don't know what the other inmate's record is."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1832.804,1834.04,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.322,1838.787,"You could house transferees only with other transferees, I assume."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1838.787,1839.696,--That's--
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.696,1841.388,Is that... is that too hard to figure out?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1841.388,1842.503,"--That's possible, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.898,1850.926,"Ms. Grunder, is this policy a... an unwritten policy of California?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1850.926,1852.617,"It is... yes, it is a practice."
2004.03-636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1855.096,1856.954,An admitted practice but not written.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1856.954,1858.151,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.151,1864.755,"And is... does any other State have such a policy, written or otherwise?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1864.755,1866.946,"Yes, they do, Your Honor, and I would like to address that."
2004.03-636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.047,1888.328,What is the Texas' policy?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1888.699,1891.588,"--Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.411,1907.608,Is in the briefs?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1910.413,1912.066,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is in the briefs."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1922.402,1924.26,All right.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1949.789,1957.325,"Your Honor, actually there's another State, Oklahoma, which has a very similar policy that says that--"
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1957.325,1957.591,Okay.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,1976.977,1982.838,"--Well, I think the answer is that they don't have the same problems that California has."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.5,1997.986,May I go back to Texas?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2022.385,2023.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.676,2046.905,"On the individualized, there was something that I didn't grasp."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2073.654,2076.588,It would have a fair amount of information.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.851,2088.309,"But again, that's the kind of administrative problem that would seem easily fixable."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2094.708,2102.677,"But the fact of the matter is, Your Honor, the counties aren't preparing the presentences... presentence reports in a timely fashion, and... and they're not sending them--"
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.677,2104.739,"Well, maybe something should be done about that."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2104.739,2106.104,"--Yes, with the counties, perhaps."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.861,2125.256,May I ask what's probably a stupid question?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2139.457,2148.307,"No, Your Honor, because in prison the animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and that inmate may be subjected--"
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.307,2148.723,Between the gangs.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2156.48,2159.414,--There's not a presumption that the person is a member of the gang.
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.567,2170.681,"Well, if he's not a member of the gang, isn't the danger that he'll become affiliated with the gang increased by insisting on putting him with the same race as... as he is?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2170.681,2191.775,"--That may be, but there is also a danger that if he is housed interracially and subjected to gang pressures on the yard, that he will then be in a situation to go back to his cell, when the door is closed and the lights are out, and commit violent acts upon his cellmate at... because of pressures that he's receiving from members of his own race."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.775,2195.219,"Of course, you... you have never... no evidence that that's ever happened because you've never tried it."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2195.219,2197.885,"In the reception centers, no."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2205.233,2211.549,You... you said a second ago that there's a significant difference between the conditions in the jails and the conditions in... in the prisons.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2220.26,2221.291,"Yes, I think that's true."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.958,2252.333,"Apart from the gang situation, is there reason to think that their minds change in the sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply because they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2252.333,2253.797,"Yes, I... I believe it is."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2253.797,2255.555,And do we have any evidence to that effect?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2255.555,2262.364,"Well, the reality in prison is that people are pressured to join gangs and to... you either hang with your own or you don't and--"
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.364,2265.048,"But that... I mean, that goes back to the gang membership situation."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2266.988,2268.187,"--Yes, it's true."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.967,2304.223,But it still seems to me that a new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that pressure with the... his cellmates than with somebody out in the yard.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2304.223,2306.907,"--And he may well be, Your Honor, but what--"
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.907,2313.594,And it seems to me insurance against him joining a racial gang is cell... cell him with somebody who's not of the same race.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2313.594,2319.001,--But you... but to do that would be to invite danger to the... to the other inmate.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.111,2327.629,How does it compare to intraracial violence?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2327.629,2335.802,"--There hasn't, as... as we've talked about, been a problem with interracial violence in the cells because they're not housed that way."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.826,2338.159,I mean--
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2338.159,2338.819,--In general.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2338.819,2339.85,--overall.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2339.85,2350.624,"There are some problems with intraracial violence, but they're generally more founded in personal relations as opposed to a race-based... you know, some other sort of animosity."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2355.453,2364.824,"But there... is there any figures on the prison population as a whole, the incidents of interracial violence as opposed to intraracial violence?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2364.824,2365.567,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.136,2375.105,And do we know... does this record tell us what happens after the 60 days?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2398.799,2405.237,"What we do have in the record, Your Honor, is that the policy and the practice does not apply after the 60 days."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.264,2421.971,So we just don't have any information whether this line between the 60 days is imaginary.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2421.971,2423.774,"We do, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2434.67,2450.44,"When... when they do choose that, do you respect a choice to cell with... with another member of... of the... of... do you respect the choice when two members of a gang want to cell together?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2450.44,2452.092,Two members of the same gang?
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2452.092,2452.381,Same gang.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2452.381,2458.203,It... it would depend on if they are... what level of gang membership they are.
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.557,2481.981,Do you... do you have a... do you have any record of... of requests by different... members of different gangs to cell together?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2481.981,2498.738,"We don't have any record of that, but I... I can tell you that if members of opposing gangs were to request a cell together, first of all, they would both have to agree, which would be highly unlikely, and there... it would probably be viewed with a bit of suspicion as to what was going on."
2004.03-636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2512.278,2529.452,"--Ms. Grunder, do you agree with opposing counsel that even if evaluated under the Turner rule, properly applied, that California's policy would not survive?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2529.452,2532.507,I do not agree with counsel.
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.084,2560.038,"It wouldn't... it wouldn't pass if... would it, if we do not accept your argument that California cannot efficiently get records sent along with inmates so that, at the time at least of transfers, the prisons are in a position to know what they're getting?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2566.992,2574.777,"Well, it may be more than just administrative efficiency because every prison is different and there are different gang pressures at each prison."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.371,2587.993,"Well, that's--"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2587.993,2589.108,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2589.108,2591.337,"--No. I don't want to cut your argument short, but here's what's bothering me."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2605.083,2610.079,The officials have deemed that that is an appropriate policy.
2004.03-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.46,2611.831,Okay.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2631.522,2639.679,"Not with respect to the transferees, Your Honor, and it's true that the transfer policy certainly is more in jeopardy under the Turner standard."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.946,2653.713,You said that--
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.713,2657.633,May I ask just one other question about the... the purpose you're trying to achieve?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2670.637,2672.017,"It's multi-fold, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.017,2673.237,It's what?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2673.237,2674.23,It's multi-fold.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2711.52,2713.733,--There was something--
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.733,2714.188,May I ask... excuse me.
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.507,2725.583,--Where is it?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2725.583,2730.08,"Yes, Your Honors, at page 41 of the brief."
2004.03-636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.662,2739.263,I see.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2739.263,2747.808,And also note 13 of the Trulson study indicates that it did not apply in Texas' equivalent of California's reception centers.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.346,2758.089,--Let... let me ask--
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2758.089,2758.682,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.682,2761.82,--about that standard at least as the Ninth Circuit applied it.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2786.34,2795.545,"Well, in this case the inmate put forth no experts of any kind."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.743,2815.979,But how would an inmate who was objecting to this racial segregation go about proving such a case?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2820.354,2822.583,"--That would be one way, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.583,2829.437,"And so one could put in that Texas study, but you said that wouldn't be good enough."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2829.437,2834.433,"Well, the Texas study doesn't... doesn't apply to the initial intake process."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2834.433,2853.752,"So you... you... supposing an inmate who would have to call a bevy of experts that he has no wherewithal to... to pay for... I mean, you are essentially saying an inmate cannot challenge this policy."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2853.752,2855.981,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2869.606,2875.095,"Well, I asked how would an inmate prove this, and you said you would need experts."
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2881.327,2885.869,"--Well, the same way the inmate would do it in any other litigation that is brought by an inmate."
2004.03-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.734,2899.986,"Now, why... why should you use the Turner standard?"
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2949.604,2956.663,"Unlike in a non-prison setting, there aren't other rights to be balanced."
2004.03-636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.152,2978.954,That... that same argument could have made in... in arguing about racial segregation in the schools and... and in the military and everything else.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2981.638,2988.779,"--Well, there's... there's no... the prison officials here have an affirmative duty to protect the other inmates under the Eighth Amendment, and--"
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.779,2992.123,Do you accept that this is invidious discrimination on the basis of race?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2994.352,2996.088,"--We don't think it's invidious, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.831,2998.112,It's not affirmative action.
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,2998.112,3002.487,"--This is not affirmative action, no."
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.579,3043.149,Is that... is that invidious?
2004.03-636,2,24012,frances_t_grunder,,3043.149,3045.34,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
2004.03-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3045.34,3046.038,Is it affirmative action?
