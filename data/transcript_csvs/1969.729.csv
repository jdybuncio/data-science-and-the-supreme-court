1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.063,"Number 729, Bachellar against Maryland."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,30.051,35.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,130.175,142.685,"Just before you do, Mr. Amsterdam, let me be sure that I understand the distinct categories into which you put your three issues in increasing breadths."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,161.201,168.473,It has to do with the particularized standards of vagueness and over breadth applicable in the First Amendment area.
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.493,197.628,Alright.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,197.628,204.93,"Now, it is not unusual that in the disorderly conduct area, the statute itself does not contain the exhaustive definition of the crime."
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,281.308,294.209,"Now, the term peace and quiet, there is linked up directly with the incite, and the peace and quiet are linked, are they not?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,294.209,295.739,"Well, it is unclear."
1969.729,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,450.188,451.193,Is that dispute?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,454.735,457.934,"Oh, it absolutely -- it does indeed Your Honor."
1969.729,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,499.609,502.671,I think that I didn't make my question clear.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,507.705,512.546,"No, that is one of three contentions and at the moment, I am not addressing my --"
1969.729,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,512.546,518.379,Suppose they were there wrongfully and they had a right to put them out and they did put them out.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,525.212,525.391,Excuse me.
1969.729,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,525.391,529.331,I don't know which is right or wrong on the violation of the law.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,529.331,535.896,It would have no relevance whatever if they were charged with disorderly conduct in the recruiting center.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.871,575.718,Does it have some relationship in the flow and sequence of events to what happened before they went in and after they came out?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,575.718,592.041,"Absolutely, there is no question about that and I am not arguing for one moment that the court below could not take account in determining whether what they were charged with was disorderly conduct as its conduct on the street with their conduct before they went in and while they went in and after they came out."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,595.518,602.259,You don't think the statute covers the conduct in the recruiting office itself?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,602.259,603.124,"Pardon me, Mr. Justice."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.124,604.264,I'm just looking at the statute.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,618.025,628.142,"I am quite sure that the interior of a business office is not an elevator, lobby or corridor of an office building."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.632,636.871,"An office building, if it's a building with an office in it, I suppose, isn't it?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,636.871,642.797,"Well, but this requires that it be the elevator, lobby or corridor of an office building."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.553,765.344,"Now, there were 25 or 30 other people who had been picketing on the street for fairly long period of time while your clients were in the office, is that correct?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,765.344,767.511,That's correct.
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,791.497,792.598,At closing time?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,792.598,794.776,And then they were thrown out.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,797.468,816.832,"You spoke of their marching in a line, now some of the pictures indeed show they were marching in a line, but Exhibit 9 which is, one of the exhibits here is not much of a line, would you say, this is a crowd in front of the store spilling out onto the street."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,830.34,833.267,Let us be clear in timing Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.096,844.008,What was going on that time at 9:00?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,844.008,850.793,"The six petitioners had been thrown out of the office and were on the sidewalk, in front of it."
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,875.036,876.67,It's a crowd?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,876.67,877.216,That is certainly --
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.216,878.385,It's a crowd of people.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,885.55,891.642,They are at that point depending on the view one takes to the testimony which was never resolved by the jury.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.383,913.054,Isn't the whole idea of a disorderly conduct statute to preclude and prevent the kind of collection and episodes that are involved in Exhibit 9?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,913.054,915.337,"No, I don't think it is by any means."
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,921.698,926.038,Doesn't it refer in terms to the responses of others.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,940.346,949.284,"There is no doubt about that, unless the public responds -- well, I better not go that far."
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,974.831,981.31,Was anyone arrested while the picketing was going on in the orderly way?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,981.31,982.443,No.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,982.443,985.261,"Indeed, the police afforded protection to them, did they not?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,985.261,986.581,They did indeed.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,986.581,993.479,They were there to guarantee their right to picket and parade up and down in front of the recruiting office.
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,993.479,995.138,"Absolutely, no question about it."
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.062,1372.73,"Mr. Amsterdam, do you -- are you saying also that no one could possibly know from the statute that sitting down and blocking a sidewalk was covered by statute?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1372.73,1376.569,I am most certainly am saying that no one could know that.
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.569,1379.255,That's part of your vagueness argument?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1379.255,1384.826,"Yes, but Mr. Justice White, let me explain why I'm saying that."
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.74,1418.609,You don't think I'm disturbing anybody who wants to use the sidewalk if I block the sidewalk completely?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1418.609,1421.466,I have no doubt that you would be disturbing those people who wants to use --
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.466,1425.041,"Well, why isn't that covered by the statute?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1425.041,1425.453,Because the statute --
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.453,1433.454,And why wouldn't you have notice that -- sitting down on the sidewalk and blocking the passage would disturb people?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1433.454,1445.283,"Well, even on the face of the statute itself, it's not simply a matter of disturbing, it is a matter of acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace."
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.459,1512.077,I understand --
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1512.077,1512.999,That you're guilty.
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.999,1526.995,"I understand that you have far more to your case than just saying that sitting down on the sidewalk isn't covered by the statute because even if it is, well, you still have a lot of your case left, because it covers a lot of other things too."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1526.995,1539.933,"There is one other thing I should respond Mr. Justice White, your question assumes something that I think the Court may well assume when it comes to this case and I want to be very clear, I don't think it's a fair assumption."
1969.729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.124,1562.843,You don't -- you don't think they had any chance at all to get up before they were arrested?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1562.843,1565.954,I think that the testimony is conflicting on that.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.042,1568.423,And did not resolve by a verdict?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1571.994,1572.636,Pardon me.
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.636,1576.014,"Aren't conflicts in testimony always resolved by jury verdicts, not up of this Court."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1576.014,1579.144,Only of the issues that was submitted to the jury for their resolution.
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.68,1795.874,"Is this still the law in Maryland, Mr. Amsterdam, that â€“- rather peculiar law in Maryland that the jury is the judge both with the facts and the law?"
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1795.874,1796.892,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1798.619,1802.876,So what relevance here are the instructions of the trial judge?
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1802.876,1805.044,They are supposed to be merely advisory.
1969.729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1823.004,1842.814,"Well, I just wonder in the case, and I think perhaps the unique situation of Maryland where the jury is made the judge of both facts and the law, whether our decisions of coming from other jurisdictions, where that is far from true, are completely relevant."
1969.729,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1842.814,1863.39,"I have no doubt that if the Court were disposed to treat Maryland differently than any other jurisdiction for that purpose, that Maryland's whole law disorderly conduct would have to be unconstitutional because what that would do would be to deprive this Court of imposing legal restrictions on the formulation of rules in the First Amendment area."
1969.729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.03,1918.699,"Thank you, Mr. Amsterdam."
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,1927.485,1933.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, so as the Justices, may it please the Court."
1969.729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.532,1971.828,"Speak up a little -- Mr. Lentz, would you just raise your voice a little certainly."
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,1971.828,1975.563,This is not a complicated case.
1969.729,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2076.11,2081.338,I take it that you -- that Baltimore has no anti-picketing law.
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2081.338,2083.094,"That is correct to the best of my knowledge, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2083.094,2084.542,But the state has one.
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2084.542,2086.612,That's correct sir.
1969.729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.612,2092.184,Is there law or ordinance about disobeying an order of an officer?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2092.184,2092.795,"No, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.311,2107.184,But there isn't a separate one just for that alone?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2107.184,2109.5,"Not to my knowledge, no sir."
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.5,2115.103,"But there is a separate one as I understand it, making an offense to obstruct the street or sidewalk?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2115.103,2115.759,Yes.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.204,2191.211,"Well, could I ask you then, surely the statute and the instructions to the jury would permit the convictions for saying anything that disturbs someone?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2191.211,2191.917,Yes.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.917,2196.483,And the instructions specifically permitted the jury to convict on that basis?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2196.483,2197.612,Yes.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.612,2208.622,"Now, if there's any evidence in the case on which imaginably or rationally, the jury could have convicted for saying something --"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2208.622,2210.665,"None -- none whatsoever, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.638,2226.685,"What do you -- you mean that time they, you mean at time they were arrested right then?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2226.685,2231.337,At any time during outside of the singing that went on.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.337,2235.247,But weren't these petitioners among those who had been carrying signs?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2235.247,2235.546,Yes.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.546,2236.992,Weren't they carrying handbills inside the --
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2236.992,2244.38,"Yes, well, the evidence does not indicate whether they were then carrying handbills inside."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.841,2247.533,"They wanted to display their posters, aren't they?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2247.533,2248.421,That's correct.
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.062,2262.075,And then you say there is no evidence in this record from which anybody could rightfully infer that the jury might have convicted these petitioners for what they said?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2262.075,2263.232,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.77,2267.531,"Let's assume there was, let's assume there was --"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2267.531,2268.912,"Well, alright, let's assume there was."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.912,2280.54,"There was something in this record from which it could be inferred that, it could be rationally -- that the jury could rationally convict them for speaking, and the instructions authorized them to do so."
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2283.726,2293.319,"There would be no basis for arriving at that level, Your Honor because the only words brought out were the singing that was done."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.197,2329.745,"Well, if these petitioners have been carrying a sign at the time they were arrested or had the signs in their hands at the time they were arrested, and the jury might have convicted them for speaking in a way that disturbed people, what would you think about their convictions?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2329.745,2347.839,"Well, this court has ruled that picketing is not pure speech so that we get in that never, never land, that gray area where it's not purely covered by the First Amendment umbrella of protection."
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.629,2495.351,"Mr. Lentz, I beg your pardon."
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2495.351,2496.181,I'm sorry.
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.181,2498.566,Before you leave these exhibits --
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2498.566,2503.946,"I've got to clogged up your station tube, Your Honor, so that might account from me not hearing you."
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.014,2512.608,"Before you leave these exhibits, is Exhibits 7 a picture taken inside the recruiting office?"
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2512.608,2514.849,"That's correct, yes, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.849,2518.555,"And so, the gentleman on the left there as you look at the picture is not a policeman."
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2519.469,2524.789,"That is Sergeant Ramley, the recruiting officer assigned to the recruiting office."
1969.729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.789,2525.332,Thank you.
1969.729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.332,2529.536,About what time is this Exhibit 9 taken?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2533.17,2543.614,Exhibit 9 on page 170 Mr. Justice would have to be taken sometime between 5:00 and 5:15.
1969.729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.896,2551.557,I see quite a few policemen in the middle there.
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2551.557,2552.456,Yes.
1969.729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.456,2555.324,Does that help you on the timing?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,2555.324,2567.052,"No, as I say, the testimony indicates that Exhibit 9, this photograph was taken after the petitioners were ejected from the recruiting office."
1969.729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.286,3037.229,Where are you reading?
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,3037.229,3041.152,"I am reading from my notes, Your Honor."
1969.729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.152,3042.312,I know but --
1969.729,1,27514,h_edgar_lentz,,3042.312,3045.076,I'll refer you to --
