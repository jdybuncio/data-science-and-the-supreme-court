1972.71-1428,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.721,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1428, Hensley against the Municipal Court."
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,33.498,36.819,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1428,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,160.341,163.147,Is that still relevant to us?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,163.147,172.833,That may be relevant in so far as we deal with his status on release on recognizance or whether or not there’s been a deliberate bypass.
1972.71-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.474,278.046,"Mr. Bass, as the practical matter, is this about the only factual situation in which this -- in which the federal habeas petitioner will have exhausted state remedies and still be free on his own recognizance?"
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,291.899,302.505,"Well, we don’t get into the question as to whether or not the state remedies are so ineffective as to check the rights of the petitioner that we have a question under 2254."
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,343.039,347.018,"Well, couldn’t the state court reach the same point?"
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,347.018,349.162,The state court reached the custody question.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.162,354.226,Couldn’t it reach the same point as to whether he voluntarily absented himself or not?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,354.226,355.213,They could but --
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,355.213,356.409,Was it litigated?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,356.409,357.897,The problem was that it was never --
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,357.897,358.935,Was it litigated?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,358.935,364.954,It was raised but the state habeas corpus petitions were denied without opinion.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,369.986,371.868,Was that a direct appeal?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,371.868,373.166,There was a direct appeal.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.166,374.47,What happened to that?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,374.47,376.202,The appeal was affirmed by the --
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.202,379.315,Was that point raised in the direct appeal?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,379.315,380.532,"Which point, Your Honor?"
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.532,384.354,That he deliberately absented himself?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,384.354,392.631,I believe that the state court took the position that there was a presumption that anyone who absents themselves waives --
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.631,394.893,Is any of that in the record?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,394.893,395.581,The --
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,395.581,398.252,Or do I have to go look for it?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,398.252,401.09,"I believe the -- no, the opinion of the --"
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.09,402.806,And I don’t mind doing it.
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,402.806,406.68,The opinion of the state court is not in the record.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,420.201,424.696,And what is the point you raised on this federal habeas corpus?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,424.696,435.126,"Well, the issue this time is the custody question, but the underlying constitutional questions asserted in the petition relate to freedom of religion and the Fourteenth Amendment due process."
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,435.126,439.732,Freedom of religion?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,439.732,444.77,"Fourteenth Amendment due process and that he was sentenced, that he was convicted in absentia."
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,458.071,461.617,Why didn’t he have the opportunity to present in the state court?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,461.617,464.546,That was due to a combination of factors.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.036,480.625,This point was raised on direct appeal with a competent counsel?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,480.625,488.596,The point was not raised in the appeal taken to the Superior Court Appellate Department.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,488.596,490.469,Was it raised in the state habeas corpus?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,490.469,491.602,It was raised in the state habeas corpus.
1972.71-1428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.602,493.206,By a competent counsel?
1972.71-1428,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,493.206,496.261,Yes.
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1589.57,1592.219,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1618.732,1626.724,"Mr. Lempert, how long does the Municipal Court grants his jurisdiction (Inaudible)?"
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1626.724,1637.259,"Until such time as either the defendant is acquitted or until such time as the completion of the sentence, if one has imposed, is completed, including any period of probation."
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.259,1639.344,Maybe less than or more than 20 years?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1639.344,1643.944,Until such time as the execution of the sentence begins.
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1649.588,1654.348,It wasn’t clear in California one way or the other but sometimes the court reached to those standards.
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1654.348,1657.928,At the termination of the trial or the termination of the sentence.
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1657.928,1661.31,But what happens on appeal if you leave the jurisdiction?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1661.31,1663.201,Not if the sentence is stayed as such.
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1667.278,1669.719,"Well, could he hold the sentence over the period of one year?"
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1669.719,1671.037,"No, not volitionally."
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.527,1675.223,I thought you said he can stay as long as he wanted to?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1675.223,1678.815,"Well, at the request of the defendant, he could."
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.815,1679.263,He could?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1679.263,1680.361,I believe he could.
1972.71-1428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.701,1696.348,I think it’s what you stated awhile ago?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1696.348,1700.38,No.
1972.71-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.105,1779.359,"But Mr. Lempert, the state could have vindicated that right here, couldn’t it through its own Municipal Court judges’ refusal to grant the stay?"
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1779.359,1791.665,"Only up till 1970, thereafter, it was the Federal Courts and the Justices of this Court and other courts of the Ninth Circuit that prevented the Municipal Court from acting."
1972.71-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.222,1845.211,"But Mr. Lempert, if Judge Nelson hadn’t granted this stay, is it fair to suggest that nonetheless before determination on the merits of the federal habeas petition either the District Court or a judge of the Ninth Circuit or a Justice of this Court would’ve enlarge the petitioner?"
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,1845.211,1861.086,"Well, the -- that could’ve been done if the Federal Courts had wanted to do that, that is if the defendant had gone into custody, there is machinery whereby when a petitioner files a habeas corpus in Federal Court, he can be released by the Federal Courts."
1972.71-1428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.947,2027.33,"Suppose that you -- but the moment, within one minute theoretically, at least after this person out of penitentiary he could bring the same habeas corpus?"
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2027.33,2027.738,That’s correct.
1972.71-1428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2035.939,2038.001,And then could the District Court release him at that time?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2038.001,2043.88,"If the District Court at that time wanted to exercise its discretion, yes it could."
1972.71-1428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2075.402,2081.02,What if you’re under an order to show up at the time certain?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2081.02,2087.835,"At the time that you appear, you’re responding to court’s order but I don’t believe that you are in custody of that court."
1972.71-1428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2087.835,2091.565,What about when the time passes and you don’t show?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2091.565,2096.318,"If it’s a willful failure to appear, you may very well be in contempt of that court."
1972.71-1428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2098.596,2100.502,But you don’t think you’re in custody?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2100.502,2103.995,Not at that time if it would be -- the defendant could be anywhere at that time.
1972.71-1428,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2103.995,2108.274,You might be guilty as indicated in the argument of a separate offense also.
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2108.274,2109.472,A different offense under the California --
1972.71-1428,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.472,2110.673,Under a constitute custody?
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2110.673,2112.221,Under the California recognizance release.
1972.71-1428,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2112.221,2113.182,Right.
1972.71-1428,1,21109,dennis_alan_lempert,,2113.182,2117.801,A defendant in order to be released on his own recognizance relinquishes certain rights.
1972.71-1428,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3035.221,3037.935,"Yes, Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1428,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3065.753,3087.41,"Did I get the impression that you thought that you said before that going in, in this process of surrendering himself to custody of the state and then immediately filing on a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal Court and asking, was this a meaningless ritual, is that?"
1972.71-1428,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3087.41,3092.342,I thought it was a meaningless ritual for the petitioner to have to go through.
1972.71-1428,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.82,3148.918,"Very well, Mr. Bass."
