2009.09-5201,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.526,"We will hear argument next in case 09-5201, Barber v. Thomas, the Warden."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,6.715,11.351,"Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,42.747,44.728,But it doesn't always mean that.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,88.208,89.393,Exactly.
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.393,94.233,"Unless you think they are supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several months after he leaves."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,94.233,102.29,"Your Honor, that is a perfect use of ""term of imprisonment"" to mean actual time and any good time credits earned."
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.29,103.229,Right.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,103.229,105.351,"And it uses the term ""release""."
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.576,127.122,I'm not addressing that.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,148.752,153.299,I respectfully disagree because it expires.
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.151,167.666,That's right.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,167.666,177.149,But why isn't the term of imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,198.311,212.116,"Justice Alito, that would be the end of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of imprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the 365 days that person has earned maximum good time credit--"
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,212.116,212.681,Right.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,212.681,216.18,--That he should receive credit towards the service of the sentence.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,230.501,230.798,"Well, hang on."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,266.014,267.063,--It doesn't change.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,281.87,290.445,But you don't know whether that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,290.445,291.24,--That's fine.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,307.107,309.525,"Well, I'm not sure where you get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the statute."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,348.652,350.727,--I do -- do not think it changes.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.378,375.75,"Counsel, I'm -- perhaps I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at it."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,439.441,447.158,"--Justice Sotomayor, we are not asking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when they determine whether they should receive it."
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.486,485.845,"No, not at all."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,496.167,497.462,And the--
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,497.462,505.491,And -- but it doesn't mean that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is predicated on the idea that service of year two begins on the 311th day.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,505.491,511.66,"--If there is an adjustment for good time, because ""term of imprisonment"" is a term of art that doesn't mean time served only."
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.393,513.111,But I don't understand that.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,524.026,539.99,"--Justice Alito, if I could refer you to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those refers -- when they are talking about a term of imprisonment, each refers to it as ""less good time""."
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,542.221,563.368,"Well, do you do it if you take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10 years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence, as provided in subsection (b)."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,563.368,563.98,--Exactly.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,563.98,578.505,"So each year that he served, you add up the number of days he has served, the good time credit, and you subtract them from the 120 months that you have given him, and you figure out when he's going to get out."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,582.892,587.643,"If you do that, you only end up with eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days."
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.391,591.842,But that's the way the language is written.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,612.346,620.078,--We are going to -- the rate phrase is: Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the term of imprisonment.
2009.09-5201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.234,697.093,What do you do with -- if -- it's a very short sentence?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,703.512,704.104,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.104,706.807,"But 360 days, what do you do with that?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,706.807,708.542,With 360--
2009.09-5201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,708.542,708.901,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,712.93,716.366,"--If it says 366 days, so that the year--"
2009.09-5201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.366,717.473,"No, 360."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,718.987,727.499,"--Then it -- a 360-day sentence would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are agreed that ""term of imprisonment"" means a sentence of more than a year."
2009.09-5201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.796,732.733,So the person that gets a year and a day serves less than the person that gets less than a year?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,732.733,733.482,That is correct.
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.478,748.179,How can you earn the good time?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,752.491,753.801,That gets us to the--
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.801,759.425,"So you are going to let him out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't earned the good time in the year?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,759.425,760.143,--He has.
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.143,760.377,What did he do?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,761.079,771.514,"He has because of the last sentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the two-step process."
2009.09-5201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.645,790.878,"Yes, but that still couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only 42 days in six weeks."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,790.878,794.33,That's only a measure when you make the determination.
2009.09-5201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.747,809.749,But I'm saying the special mechanism can't give the full 54 days.
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.749,810.185,Exactly.
2009.09-5201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.185,813.277,Because they don't make it until 42 days before the end of the sentence.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,813.277,831.191,"They make it until 311 days at the end of the sentence, because what they do is they make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time would be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a year and a day sentence, and they make that determination earlier."
2009.09-5201,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.879,883.667,"I'm sure there is something wrong with this predicate to this question, but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a determination of good time credit within 15 days after the end of each year of the sentence."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,883.667,884.03,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,884.03,889.088,They cannot make that determination within 15 days of the 311 days.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,897.55,901.816,Our position is that the Bureau of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases.
2009.09-5201,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.354,927.069,"You treat each year of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good behavior, no?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,927.069,927.884,Not necessarily.
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,947.515,948.357,"Well, why do you do have to do that?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1018.196,1034.785,"Justice Breyer, I think it doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates an 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note that the sentencing table upon which every Federal sentence is predicated is based on 85 percent."
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1035.362,1043.875,"No, that isn't what the -- if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, I think the best evidence of that is you read the introduction to the guidelines."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1067.413,1082.203,"--Your Honor, we are relying very heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by.85 in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include good time."
2009.09-5201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.856,1091.995,"Of course, the government contends it's none of the sentencing commission's business."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1094.915,1096.76,--That is their position.
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.16,1117.517,But there is nothing in there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a guideline.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1135.26,1143.195,--I think that the court could be advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at a harsher sentence.
2009.09-5201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.388,1215.664,"Mr. Sady, you -- you said something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1240.231,1248.491,"Justice Ginsburg, there are approximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about 195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits."
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.889,1267.918,Is this right?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1279.429,1279.834,"Yes, the 419--"
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.834,1287.751,"I take it what you want is you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 54 days for that tenth year?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1287.751,1289.221,--Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.221,1289.736,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1317.66,1345.304,"Each year is served in the -- if you take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset that we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10 opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when you are in -- you go to the last sentence that acknowledges that you are going to have to make some arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are going to decide that you have done well enough that you are going to be able to get the full credit for the last year."
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1369.839,1379.819,"Well, the statute says that it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1379.819,1380.256,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1380.256,1385.129,"Now, when does -- when is that point, in your opinion?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1385.129,1389.298,The Bureau of Prisons probably has discretion in administering.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1393.451,1393.747,Okay.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1399.777,1403.15,That's -- that's when they are making the determination.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.209,1413.008,And then what do--
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1413.008,1413.46,--311.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1413.46,1424.421,The statute says that they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1424.421,1424.799,No.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1424.799,1431.779,"And what I'm asking is, when is the end of the first year of the term within the meaning of that language?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1431.779,1433.936,The meaning of that language is day 3--
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1433.936,1434.217,Is it day 3--
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1434.217,1435.34,--Excuse me.
2009.09-5201,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.34,1437.871,"--Is it day 365, or is it day 311?"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1437.871,1439.181,It depends.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1469.309,1471.259,--So the next year--
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1471.259,1473.29,--adjust and reset at the next 365.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1473.29,1475.337,--you start it at 311?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1475.337,1475.993,No.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.993,1480.586,And he now serves another year and you back him up again at the end of that year?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1481.678,1489.329,"Yes, that is -- that is certainly one way of mechanically doing it so that you have 10 blocks of 365 days each as a term of imprisonment."
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1490.207,1492.235,--And you -- and you think that their system is easier?
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1492.235,1492.75,--Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1493.187,1493.64,That their system is--
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1493.64,1494.623,"No, absolutely not."
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.762,1517.614,"Another way to think, and I think probably you'll -- if you look through the records of the commission, they even thought about this problem, and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by various people who were there, which say that for this reason you are bringing up, that it might have been thought there was no credit for the first year."
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1536.824,1537.26,Yes.
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.306,1538.618,Everybody's going to do that.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1540.287,1543.332,"To address that first year, to make sure that they did that."
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1543.332,1543.753,That's what happened.
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1545.36,1546.623,Exactly.
2009.09-5201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1546.623,1547.965,"--Ah, I better get that--"
2009.09-5201,0,42084,stephen_r_sady,,1547.965,1549.264,--when it was at 36 days.
2009.09-5201,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.021,1570.925,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1578.047,1580.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1609.239,1613.86,"But the trouble with that, and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, because then--"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1613.86,1614.612,--Right.
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.612,1619.514,--we never considered it when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that time because the language was different.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1657.592,1661.905,"Well, and that's why they have the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the proration."
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1698.218,1699.248,There is a premise flaw there.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1704.512,1705.292,--Well--
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1705.292,1711.461,"So your answer about this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your premise is not the same."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1711.461,1723.705,"--That's why for each full year served, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that you are making a determination at the end of the year for the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth year, as Justice Breyer pointed out--"
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1723.705,1726.486,I'm not worried about sentences that are more than 2 years.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1739.716,1750.882,"--So, the way this works is that for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or 13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving credit through that first year, their good time credit brings them below a year."
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1752.445,1752.898,"Counsel, I--"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1752.898,1753.881,And what the law--
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1753.881,1754.788,--That's what I'm saying to you.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1763.207,1766.171,--Except for the last year or partial year.
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1782.619,1784.417,He is not going to get 54 days?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1785.01,1785.431,That's right.
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1790.473,1794.783,--I just want to make absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; I did the math backwards.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1794.783,1795.095,Right.
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1795.095,1799.404,Which was the one that Justice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth--
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1799.404,1799.86,Right.
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1799.86,1806.357,"--Which is 54 days are earned back for each year, and you take it off the full term of imprisonment."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1814.119,1815.071,Absolutely.
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.139,1837.12,May I just interrupt with one question?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1847.368,1847.852,--Well--
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.852,1849.633,"Or less than 9 years, rather."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1849.633,1850.226,--That's -- that's right.
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.536,1856.582,So how does he -- how does he get his 10th block of good time?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1858.251,1864.607,"--Well, under the government's view he can only earn good time credit when he is actually incarcerated."
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.794,1867.091,--Right.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1875.71,1887.345,"--Well, so, if you take a 10-year prisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way it currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has accrued 432 days of good time credit."
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.345,1888.721,Which is more than a year.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1888.721,1889.002,Right.
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1916.49,1919.552,And each of those 4 years included 54 days of credit?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1919.552,1920.273,That's right.
2009.09-5201,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1972.732,1974.249,"Well, I didn't understand them to be saying that."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1992.804,2003.613,"I think that's right, which first it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, which says at the end of each year, so that reads 311-day cycle."
2009.09-5201,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2026.573,2034.021,"Well, I think that they would say you won't know when the second year has begun until the full calendar year has been completed."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2034.021,2046.141,"And I guess the -- the difficulty with that approach is that it seems to me that once the 311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new 311-day cycle on day 312."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2046.141,2049.717,"Well, they are just not vested until the year has -- the full year has passed."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2049.717,2058.681,"Well, so vesting is a little bit unique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none of the time vests under (b)(2) until they are actually released."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.075,2062.059,"Well, I -- I use it just in the calculating sense."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2062.059,2062.402,--I see -- I see what you're saying.
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.47,2088.688,"No, no, you don't measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from 311."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2107.897,2112.538,"Justice Scalia, if you are measuring 365 days from day 311--"
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.538,2113.037,Right.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2113.037,2116.472,--then you should equally be measuring 365 days from day 1.
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.175,2119.627,He did.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2132.92,2135.716,"--Well, the -- I was half with you there."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.882,2151.444,Exactly.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2151.444,2162.284,"What the -- what the statute asks the bureau to determine is, at the end of each year, has, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated exemplary compliance with institutional regulations?"
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.591,2178.291,Except that they're not taking it off from the back end.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2215.01,2217.459,"Justice Scalia, I think that sets up an odd system."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.459,2218.836,Isn't that right?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2226.05,2226.659,"No, I -- I agree."
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.661,2263.985,"Yes, but as Justice Scalia says, you know, you do make the determination on the 365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having been a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days earlier, and then you start over."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2263.985,2264.546,But what -- that's right.
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.744,2283.677,Let me interrupt and get one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he misbehaves in year 3.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2290.896,2291.41,No.
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.416,2314.495,But he can lose his 108 days?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2314.495,2314.776,Yes.
2009.09-5201,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.776,2315.665,How can he do that?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2327.442,2328.861,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-5201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.882,2370.952,"Mr. Wall, the -- if we consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2393.239,2394.895,"Well, two reasons."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2414.432,2428.927,"We -- if we disagree with that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2428.927,2439.502,"Well, this Court's been clear -- and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this is not a criminal statute."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2442.875,2444.169,"Well, how do you explain the Granderson case?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2444.169,2445.698,--I'm sorry?
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2445.698,2447.199,The Granderson case.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2447.199,2448.962,"I'm not familiar with that case, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.962,2456.629,"I had thought that in that case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2495.784,2503.517,I think it's a check against the power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition.
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2540.064,2547.388,"Well, the Granderson case is cited in the brief for the National Association Of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies to this area and it seems to me that it ought to."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2558.758,2565.332,"--Well, it is a statute that determines in some sense how long you will be in prison, so I take your point."
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.336,2591.494,"No, but isn't there another consideration?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2612.638,2617.294,I'm -- I think the basis for that is just math that the Petitioners have done.
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.653,2620.948,"But in any event, it's clear it's a lot of money."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2645.269,2654.547,"I think it's a factor that the bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in the developing its interpretation as the agency in charge of administering the statute."
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.031,2693.733,That's true.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2703.087,2704.37,--Okay.
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.37,2707.447,"Now, you are saying don't put in any phantom time."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2777.981,2779.416,"Justice Breyer, I disagree with your premise."
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.455,2799.221,"So, in other words, they don't let him out under 311?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2799.221,2800.251,That's -- that's exactly--
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.251,2815.948,"In other words, the Bureau of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2815.948,2817.198,--And that's exactly our difference with Petitioner's view.
2009.09-5201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.65,2819.57,Is that -- is that what happens?
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2819.57,2819.851,--Yes.
2009.09-5201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.629,2875.282,"Do you disagree with your colleague that that is the case most of the time, that most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2875.282,2883.509,"There are no statistics on this, but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these Petitioners have."
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2948.873,2966.712,"Counsel, this explanation that has been given in your brief and the one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it did, is there any statement outside of the penned affidavit that explains why this choice was made?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2966.712,2974.427,"Other than the positions -- positions that the bureau has taken before the 11 courts of appeals in which it has prevails, no, the--"
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.427,2979.238,But in each one of them they have taken the position that the statute was unambiguous.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2996.291,2998.073,"--Two points, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3021.248,3027.262,"--Well, did they exercise discretion when they took the position that it was unambiguous?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3027.262,3050.565,"--As the pen declaration makes clear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix, when the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did that based on the statutory language and on making a policy choice to accommodate penological interest, ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of their projected release dates."
2009.09-5201,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3053.158,3074.181,"We have never given deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in litigation to explain something that on its face is not explained either in an agency's regulation or in its policy statement that -- that -- this is giving deference to an affidavit."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3074.181,3082.411,"--Well, it's giving deference to the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.635,3115.725,"Subsequent legislative history, so to speak, right?"
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3137.322,3141.665,"--Justice Scalia, I think it is different because that would be broadside in Overton Park."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.077,3217.699,I don't think we sent cases back under Overton Park for an agency's description of history.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3227.318,3240.327,"Justice Scalia, even -- even if you thought as the court of appeals did that the rule was procedurally invalid, you would still, as the court of appeals did, defer to the program statement under some level of deference, at least Skidmore."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.327,3242.842,You don't have to worry about me.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3250.06,3250.638,And I--
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.638,3251.73,I don't think you are lying.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3251.73,3252.338,--I -- I--
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.519,3277.689,"You say there are 195,000 sentences affected by this rule."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3287.543,3291.981,"--Justice Stevens, I think what I would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way since 1987."
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3298.43,3299.039,But the cumulated--
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.039,3302.567,Probably they didn't understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to understand.
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3302.567,3306.567,"Justice Stevens, with all respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes."
2009.09-5201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.506,3311.049,"Well, he's a lot smarter than I am."
2009.09-5201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.049,3314.438,Even Justice Breyer has got it !
2009.09-5201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3317.531,3330.914,"--But what -- what we were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than Marbury versus Madison."
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3330.914,3333.022,"Justice Kennedy, that's true."
2009.09-5201,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.499,3382.281,You can finish the--
2009.09-5201,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3382.281,3388.808,--but Congress has made a number of technical amendments and I don't think there is any evidence it did not understand of how this longstanding system works.
