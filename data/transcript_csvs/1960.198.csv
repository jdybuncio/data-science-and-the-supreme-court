1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,12.4,15.892,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,370.06,372.754,You say he was admitted as a United States citizen?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,372.754,372.915,"Yes, sir."
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,372.915,374.429,That -- that is the --
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,374.429,378.83,The certificate of entry recounted that he was a United States citizen.
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,379.485,380.414,The petitioner?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,380.414,380.884,The petitioner.
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,381.732,383.461,Yes.
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,383.461,396.703,"Madelyn Montana, the petitioner and the mother were met in New York by Madelyn's father who took them to his apartment that they owned in New Jersey and there, she and her child resided for three months with her parents."
1960.198,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,411.391,413.497,They were never divorced in any stage when --
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,413.497,414.498,"No, sir."
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,582.047,589.913,Is there any -- is there anything in the record to indicate what the administrative practice was during those years?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,589.913,592.986,"No, sir, there's not."
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,741.051,742.089,In 1855
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,742.089,743.529,"1855, yes."
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.529,748.216,"And that was apparently prompted by Mr. Binney's article, wasn't it?"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,748.216,757.284,"There has been -- I think in Chin Bow, this Court indicated that it looked like that was what happened, yes."
1960.198,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,875.108,885.084,"-- may I ask, is that really a re-enactment under your view or is it just a rearrangement or re-codification of an existing statute?"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,885.084,892.563,"Well, there was -- it -- it was spelled out in the Act that this was a repeal of all former statutes."
1960.198,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,937.043,947.971,Then do you understand the phrase in the statute reading “who are now” refer to 1874 and not 1802?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,947.971,962.471,I -- I interpret and urge the interpretation that “who are now” refers to any time between 1874 and the repeal of the Act of 1874 and 1934.
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.993,984.15,"You would read both as I understand it, as though the word “now” were not there."
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,986.547,987.677,I --
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.677,990.335,"Why, is that it?"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,990.851,992.567,-- I don't think surplusage sir.
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.534,1009.444,"What if it's -- what if the statute simply said, “Who are you that the word now weren't there?"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1009.444,1011.362,We would read it the same way.
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.362,1016.262,"You -- you would read it the same way, this statute the same way as though that's the way the statute is read --"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1016.262,1016.301,Yes.
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.301,1017.497,-- without (Inaudible)
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1017.497,1020.466,"Yes, sir."
1960.198,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1020.466,1047.839,"Well, don't you think from that statute passed in 1802, Congress used that word “now” with the view of relating to the question offers as a word in 1802, children as -- as of -- as of -- born abroad of persons who were then citizens were made citizens?"
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1047.839,1049.457,I don't think.
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.169,1352.602,Are -- are there -- both of the petitioner's parents still alive?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1352.602,1353.923,"Yes, sir."
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.923,1354.463,Both are.
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1354.463,1354.651,"Yes, sir."
1960.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.651,1355.83,And they're living together as man and wife?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1355.83,1357.162,"Yes, sir."
1960.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1357.162,1359.091,Is the father ever naturalized?
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1359.091,1359.913,"No, sir."
1960.198,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1478.094,1479.329,And might I ask you --
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1479.329,1480.079,-- rather the second --
1960.198,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1480.079,1507.132,"Please Ms. Lavin, may I ask you in that connection, in -- in connection with the argument you've just made, then what would have been the purpose in 1855 for Congress by Section 1993 to make citizens of children born out of this country to United States fathers, only fathers."
1960.198,0,16430,anna_r_lavin,,1507.132,1514.921,"Well, I -- I don't know the answer to that, but I -- I can give what I think is the -- a fair answer."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2592.555,2593.306,Thank you Your Honor.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2705.711,2716.133,Is it also uncontradicted that she did go to the consul and asked for a passport and was denied?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2716.133,2722.07,"Your Honor, it is not -- it is contradicted by us but there is nothing in the record to oppose the story."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2724.036,2725.95,You -- you say you contradict it here?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2725.95,2727.068,"Well, we -- we doubt it."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2729.562,2731.106,"Oh, well, I'm not asking about your doubts."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2731.106,2732.581,We have no basis for contradicting.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2732.581,2735.59,"I'm not asking about your doubts, I'm asking about the record."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2735.59,2735.938,The record --
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2735.938,2747.626,"You're talking about what was uncontradicted and I merely asked you if it was uncontradicted in the record that she went to the -- the Consul and asked for a passport, and it was denied."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2747.626,2749.471,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I wouldn't put it that way."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2753.716,2755.012,Why do you equivocate?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2755.012,2767.529,"Because she is an interested witness and I think this is not a patently incredible story, a story which is very convenient and is told for the first time without any corroboration 50 years after the alleged event."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.529,2769.928,Why didn't you ask the judge to make a finding to that effect?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2769.928,2773.108,"Well, the judge made a complete finding on the basis of all the evidence."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2782.013,2783.215,Why?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2783.215,2784.86,For every reason that he is alleged.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2784.86,2788.165,I thought you said a moment ago because his father was an alien?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2788.165,2789.405,This is one of the reasons.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2845.527,2850.099,May I revert just a moment to -- again to what I asked you about her going to.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2860.115,2875.665,"Well Your Honor, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, the fact is and as this Court pointed out in its opinion in Kent against Dulles, the majority opinion, at the time that petitioner was in Europe in 1906, petitioner's mother, excuse me --"
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2875.665,2876.587,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2876.587,2883.534,-- the laws of this country did not require a passport for a person who wished to come to the United States.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2902.79,2917.349,"Well, is it -- and was inconceivable that -- that she would not go there and ask for a passport before baby died or before a baby was born, why would she go afterwards and get one?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2917.349,2920.607,"Well, Your Honor I -- I say that that is not supported in the record."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2931.103,2934.096,Didn't she get a passport to come home?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2934.096,2937.228,She did -- she says she did.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2937.228,2937.668,"What, is there a (Inaudible) --"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2937.668,2942.457,Even that is a questionable because this is based only on her own statement.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2946.302,2952.658,"Well, if she was -- if she was not a citizen of the United States, would she have needed a passport?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2952.658,2954.763,She wouldn't have needed a passport either way.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2954.763,2956.528,Whether she was a citizen or not?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2956.528,2959.103,"But that is true, whether -- you're right."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.94,2993.971,May I ask you because I don't quite understand the argument.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2999.127,3019.878,"I -- I'm not saying that it would make a difference, but I'm saying, taking the argument at its utmost, assuming that a passport had been applied for, it is inconceivable that the Consul would have denied a passport under these circumstances and we say this is the story of an interesting -- a witness who has an obvious interest."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3019.878,3024.565,"Well, you frequently have that but they're not usually just thrown out."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3030.228,3035.552,"But it can be disbelieved and we believe that the trial court was the best judge of it here, sir."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3054.659,3056.128,Where is the finding in the record?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3058.044,3062.015,"Oh, here it is, I'm sorry.(Voice Overlap) --"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3082.473,3098.479,"I don't understand why you say that maybe it would, I -- I have read your finding but I do not understand why you say, his finding, that he was not a citizen, shows as a finding that she didn't go to the -- to get her passport?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3098.479,3115.052,"Well, assuming Your Honor that it might be material that a -- if a consul had acted in this fashion and then denied a passport, that might have -- assuming that might have create an estoppel, then it would be incumbent on the judge to determine whether such a situation actually had occurred."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3138.195,3140.295,"Well, that's a conclusion of law?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3140.295,3140.925,A conclusion of law.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3140.925,3141.382,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3175.41,3175.966,This is --
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3175.966,3192.477,"And then number five, “Plaintiff entered the United States of America on September 19th, 1906 when he was approximately three moths old, having been brought to the United States from Italy by his mother, Madelyn Montana.”"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3196.817,3198.731,There is no finding of fact on this issue --
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3198.731,3202.193,But I understood you to say that he found that all the facts worked against him?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3202.193,3203.359,As a matter of law.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3205.793,3208.497,I was talk -- I was talking about the finding of fact.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3208.497,3211.01,There was no specific finding of fact on that question.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3211.01,3212.25,"Well, that's -- that's all I ask you.(Voice Overlap) --"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3212.25,3216.948,There is a finding of law which I think comprehends all the contentions that were made before him.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3216.948,3263.791,"Mr. Gordon, I'm all for a counsel, who restricts himself to the case that – that's before the Court and no speculations and (Inaudible) outside of it or even to answer outside it, but I do think the question of whether your view of the argument about the validity or the acceptability of -- of the mother's testimony, I do think the question whether if that isn't -- if that is maybe subject of discussion or the difference of opinion, I do think the question whether the consul's conduct could estop, is relevant to the determination of this case."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3292.53,3293.273,It's certain is.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3293.617,3295.198,You are going to argue it?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3295.198,3296.183,On the estoppel?
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3296.183,3296.755,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3296.857,3297.21,"Well, we --"
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3297.21,3307.087,I don't mean this moment but are you going to deal whether any consul has the power to estop an act of Congress not being enforced.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3307.087,3308.745,We -- we believe whether there were --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3308.745,3311.288,"Well, I -- I don't want you to -- I just want to know whether you will argue it."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3311.288,3322.015,"Well, Your Honor, we think that this -- in the first place that this -- the story is so patiently incredible that the court below did not believe it and that it should not be believed here."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3322.015,3322.61,Alright.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3322.61,3336.931,"And secondly, we think that if there was any such action, the action of the consul in -- in denying a passport which was not required had nothing to do with this woman's coming to the United States."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3342.96,3360.097,"Well, a estoppel -- estoppel implies conduct outside of what is necessary and somebody does something which the law recognizes as creating a situation that forecloses an objection to the consequences of that action flowing."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3390.11,3394.43,Would you answer that after –[Recess]
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3394.43,3396.642,"Thank you, sir."
1960.198,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3641.827,3644.143,Where does this argument get us?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3652.329,3652.912,"That is so, sir."
1960.198,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3652.912,3656.714,"But that's not the fact, so why aren't we confronted with realities here?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3656.714,3660.818,That is what the Court of Appeals said sir and I believe that is the proper approach.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3668.934,3720.17,"That -- that -- those observations that you've just made are -- are a way of saying there couldn't be estoppel, but if there could be a estoppel, if the consul in fact dissuaded a lady from coming here and thereby having a child born here, whether he had power to do that that, whether she needed a passport, whether the Italian law required the passport, all those things are immaterial if a representation by an American official to a woman in her situation made her change her position, whereby the child was born in Italy instead of in the United States."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3754.1,3758.499,"ell, that -- that also depends, sir, on some additional assumptions."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3761.633,3765.754,"But on -- that goes too whether or not, the estoppel is made out."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3765.754,3766.432,That's one.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3766.432,3766.916,That's if --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3766.916,3768.409,The second is I think --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3768.409,3769.115,(Voice Overlap) things clear.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3773.321,3775.296,That -- that we contend and we believe that the record --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3775.296,3776.985,"I understand that, but (Inaudible) --"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3776.985,3777.572,"Alrightt, that -- that's the first."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3777.572,3779.583,-- two very different things.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3826.466,3831.072,That is our first position and the second position is that even if there were such an estoppel --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3831.072,3832.855,It doesn't -- there is none here.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3832.855,3841.855,"That the second -- does he -- there's still a third, that even if the consul did this, it did not directly result in the deprivation of a right."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3845.229,3846.757,I don't care about the passport.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3855.25,3856.748,"Well, your Honor there's nothing of the record."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3856.748,3857.407,What do you think of that?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3857.407,3861.804,There's nothing in the record to support the assumption that she couldn't have or wouldn't have --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3861.804,3862.525,Alright.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3862.525,3865.783,-- gotten to the country regardless of the consul's statement.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3865.783,3869.78,"And then thirdly, she did -- she was not disadvantaged by the representation made."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3869.78,3870.493,"That is so, sir."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3870.493,3872.108,Alright.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3872.108,3876.877,"Now, if I may proceed to -- if there are no further questions on this phase and I'll be glad to have some any further --"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3876.877,3879.703,May I ask you one question?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3883.138,3884.133,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the --"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3884.133,3886.986,Does the record show why this man is being deported?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3886.986,3889.027,"Oh, I -- I can tell you, sir."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3889.027,3889.777,"Well, I if it is not in the record?"
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3889.777,3890.441,Is that in the record?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3890.441,3891.176,It is not in the record.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3891.176,3893.93,Is it relevant to this case?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3893.93,3895.575,"I as a matter of information, I'd be glad to tell you, sir."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3895.575,3896.904,Alright.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3898.935,3899.523,It is not relevant --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3899.523,3901.25,If it's -- is it legally relevant?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3901.25,3901.735,"No, sir."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3901.735,3903.859,If it's legally relevant then it ought to be in the record.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3906.794,3909.431,Because I'm asked.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3909.431,3911.247,"I asked you, (Voice Overlap) if it was in the record?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3911.247,3912.932,"That's not in the record, sir."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3912.932,3916.546,You mustn't respond to every curiosity that one may have.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3916.546,3919.059,"I don't think I have any alternatives, sir."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3919.059,3922.557,"Mr. Gordon, just one other question."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3942.308,3942.982,"No, your Honor."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3949.116,3949.806,37 of the record --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3949.806,3955.114,"When any person comes to the United States, a record of his arrival is established under law."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3955.114,3955.562,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3955.562,3961.859,"And at the time of his arrival, the immigration officer who recorded this recorded the child as a citizen."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3961.859,3962.301,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3962.301,3965.197,So we contend that this was an error.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3977.676,3980.7,And why do you say -- why do you say it's a mistake?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3980.7,3982.288,"Well, (Voice Overlap) I'd like to -- I'd like to show you Your Honor that --"
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3982.288,3990.44,"If it's his -- if it's his duty to -- to state whether -- whether the child is a citizen or not, why do you say it's a mistake?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3990.719,3991.966,Because the fact is --
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3991.966,3993.938,What is there in the record to indicate that?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3993.938,3999.148,"Well, the fact is that he was not a citizen as we show -- show if Your Honor will permit me."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4002.289,4025.599,"I know but it might -- might not that go to the question of -- of whether the Government is foreclosed from -- from now claiming he isn't a citizen if he came in three months of age and the Government said that he was a citizen and he's lived here for 56 years or so, wouldn't that bear on it very materially?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4025.599,4034.611,"Well, I -- I think it might possibly, but the answer to that is -- that's -- in some cases that have considered similar situations, court below considered it, sir."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4064.163,4068.925,-- is there anything in the -- in the record to show this was caused by fraud or --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4068.925,4069.407,"Oh, no."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4069.407,4070.088,-- anything like that?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4070.088,4071.473,"No, sir."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4072.993,4079.006,-- is -- is there anything in the record to show except the law that time that it was a mistake?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4079.006,4080.363,It is an error of law in our --
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4080.363,4082.778,"Error of law, very well."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4082.778,4091.614,"Now if I may, I'd like to get to the phases of the argument dealing with whether Mr. Montana is a citizen."
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4296.869,4301.999,They re-enacted 2172 though and then 1855 at the same time.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4301.999,4302.902,Not exactly.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4506.024,4512.449,"Just as a matter of curiosity, Mr. Gordon, I haven't read the -- the congressional account."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4522.515,4526.816,It was not signed but it actually was a -- a reprint of a -- a publication of the previous year.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4526.816,4534.598,What I want to know is -- what I want to know is whether somebody on the floor of either House mentioned Mr. Binney's name by name.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4534.598,4537.306,"Your Honor, I don't recall, but let me refer --"
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4537.306,4538.845,I'm just curiou -- legal curiosity.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4538.845,4551.4,"No, I -- of course the Supreme Court, this Court, in two decisions specifically mentioned Mr. Binney by name has that this was a correct interpretation and that the 1855 Law was passed in order to correct this defect."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4551.4,4555.085,I have no doubt about it on basis of other materials but I just want to know --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4555.085,4555.822,I -- I don't recall --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4555.822,4556.592,-- if anybody in Congress saw them.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4556.592,4558.063,I don't recall when they specifically mentioned that.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4558.063,4560.281,Binney was a towering figure --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4560.281,4560.557,He was.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4560.557,4561.829,-- back in those days.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4561.829,4563.776,"I have taken the trouble to find that out, sir."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4563.776,4565.32,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4565.32,4569.478,He was -- he was one of the leaders of the bar in that period.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4921.878,4927.411,I thought you said that while some authorities have said -- did I misunderstood what you said a moment ago.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4927.411,4928.653,Can I restate that sir?
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4928.653,4929.253,"Yes, if you please."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4929.253,4945.065,"Some authorities have said that where the father alone is a citizen and the mother maybe an alien, the father alone can transmit citizenship, but that we say is not inconsistent with the philosophy of the statutes then in effect."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4962.397,4971.094,"But -- but wasn't it, the fact, Mr. Gordon, that by the laws of some of the foreign country, the mother -- what is it called now, the Cable -- what --"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4971.094,4971.772,Cable Act of 1922.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4971.772,4989.307,"-- the Cable -- our Cable Act was -- came much -- was -- came much -- the objective of that and the legal consequence of that, that a woman may retain, withhold a nationality on marrying an American citizen."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,4992.652,4993.625,It was not our law though.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4993.625,5009.615,"I'm not saying it was our law, but it raises dubious question if an English woman married an American and under -- under English laws, even if she retained her citizenship as an English woman, she might not avail what might be called a pure American citizen."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5009.615,5011.048,"No, she might have been a dual national --"
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5011.048,5011.384,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5011.384,5012.989,-- which is not an uncommon situation as one knows it.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5012.989,5013.846,No.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5016.706,5023.755,"I think we‘ve -- we've had perplexing questions on citizenship on dual nationalities since we've had our first nationality law, and we still have it."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5023.755,5032.981,I don't understand how if -- if anyone read the word “persons” in this to go no further than these statutes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5040.604,5049.482,"Well, that's the generous interpretation, sir and I think that maybe justified as I've said by the fact that the law regarded the family as a unit and the -- the father --"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5049.482,5052.874,But that's in -- you mean to looking -- looking at other statutes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5052.874,5053.911,We're looking what they --
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5053.911,5056.775,"Within the four corners of this statute, could that distinction be drawn?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5056.775,5062.614,"Well, let -- let me show Your Honor the legislative history and I think this is overwhelming as to what Congress intended."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5062.614,5063.266,Here I was --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5063.266,5065.667,Justice Black's question was if you don't look at anything except the words.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5065.667,5072.416,"My question was, if you look at the four corners of this statute, its language and nothing else, could that distinction be drawn?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5072.416,5073.197,"No, sir."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5073.197,5074.595,"Well, that's the question."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5074.742,5080.621,"I think -- I think though if you looked at the four corners of the 1802 Act, you might draw such a distinction."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5102.296,5106.025,As to elimination of the word father in the 1802 Act?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5106.025,5118.534,"No, as to whether Congress intended to confer citizenship on a child born to an American mother and an alien father and here I think the legislative history is unmistakable."
1960.198,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5118.534,5126.338,"Clearly, I'm confused about this but I just not understand the 1802 Act merely in reference what you just tell me with that person."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5126.338,5138.809,"But then if Your Honor will read a little further, you'll see there's a proviso in the 1802 Act which said, “Provided, citizenship rights shall not be sent to persons whose fathers never resided in the United States."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5154.698,5156.997,"Page 28, you don't say it's 18."
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5156.997,5159.249,On Section 1993.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5159.249,5159.449,No.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5161.269,5164.496,The 1802 Act appears on --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5164.496,5165.629,"This is on page 18, sir."
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5166.15,5169.087,18 of the petition for certiorari.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5170.361,5179.591,That's about two-thirds the way down to the statute provided that the right of citizenship shall not extend to persons whose fathers have never resided within the United States.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5179.591,5182.631,"Well, now why would that have been taken out?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5182.631,5187.055,"Well, I -- this -- this -- why the proviso was eliminated?"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5276.864,5281.508,"The -- the -- was this law in effect at that time, the Act of 72?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5281.508,5285.532,"No, but this is a consistent pattern of action by Congress."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5439.825,5455.32,"Before you go farther -- as I recall, counsel, she said that that -- that particular quotation that you just read referred to a subsequent section of the Act and not -- not this particular one."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5455.32,5458.767,"No, this referred to exactly to 1993."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5494.903,5496.947,Where -- where is this from the report on the Cable Act?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5496.947,5500.594,35 at the top of the page.
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5546.281,5548.458,But what happens in that law?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5548.458,5556.131,"It said -- the law said, “Hereafter, any children hereafter born shall take citizenship through the father or the mother.”"
1960.198,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5556.131,5557.225,Was it passed?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5557.225,5557.677,"Oh, yes."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5559.889,5564.155,"Was -- that was part of the Cumming's nationality proposal, wasn't it?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5564.155,5565.613,I don't know who proposed it but it had --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5565.613,5566.496,In the nationality (Voice Overlap) --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5566.496,5567.718,It had a number of proposals.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5569.496,5571.236,That's a part of the Comprehensive Nationality Act.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5571.236,5572.699,That is so.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5626.045,5633.448,What does the House report to say about that Section 5 of the 1934 Act?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5633.448,5638.977,They both -- they both -- this was (Voice Overlap) Section -- Section 1 of the 1934.
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5641.246,5649.924,As I understood the -- the house report made it clear that the amendment was intended merely to state expressly whether it'd been implicit in the 1907 --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5649.924,5650.649,"Oh no, no."
1960.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5680.916,5682.191,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5682.191,5689.018,"Now, I'd like to spend some of my few remaining moments on some of the other aspects of the case."
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5844.588,5847.313,What do you say about Attorney General Mitchell's interpretation?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5847.313,5848.609,"We have no problem, sir."
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5850.14,5851.044,Why not?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5851.044,5858.959,"Attorney General Mitchell and -- and Judge Nordbye in the Black case, were addressing an entirely different situation."
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5909.775,5913.878,The relevancy with the termination of the marriage after that year of the statute.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5913.878,5915.83,The statute provides for it.
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5926.426,5947.044,"Well, but in his opinion as I understand it correctly said that it was incongruous to suppose that Congress wanted to confer greater rights to the children of American women who had lost their citizenship and then resumed it, then they would've on the case of the children of American women who had never lost their citizenship."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5947.044,5947.932,And I agree.
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5951.778,5964.261,"Therefore, he's -- therefore, he said rightly or wrongly that the woman in the latter status who had never lost her citizenship, the child of such a woman should have the rights to be given to one of a woman in (Inaudible) --"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,5964.261,5967.492,"But, Your Honor, the petitioner's argument turns that around."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6050.855,6058.632,"In other words, are you saying what incongruity there is, is in the statute of Congress and not in any construction of it."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6058.632,6059.366,"That is right, sir."
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6076.073,6080.062,Chief Justice Taft in the (Inaudible) Weedin case --
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6080.062,6081.159,Weedin against Chin Bow.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6081.159,6087.062,Weedin case spoke of the atmosphere in which the statues must be construed.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6105.347,6106.541,That is exactly our argument.
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6110.619,6119.692,"The Attorney's General interpretation is not in reference to the 1907 Act, it was in reference to the 1934 Act and those considerations have changed."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6119.692,6123.248,"Well, that the -- may I answer it?"
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6126.149,6127.636,"Well, it's identical in that respect."
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6127.636,6128.033,That's right.
1960.198,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6128.033,6128.173,Yes.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6128.173,6129.392,It provides for the resumption that --
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6129.392,6132.252,And he was dealing with the 1934 statute.
1960.198,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6132.252,6135.74,But it was broader down from the 1907 Act because of the same provision.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6135.74,6137.477,"The same considerations apply, sir."
1960.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6250.367,6259.699,"Mr. Gordon, before you go on, I -- I know you question its relevancy, but I'd like to know the grounds on which Montana is being deported?"
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6259.699,6265.747,He is deported for having been convicted for two crimes involving moral turpitude and I'll tell Your Honor what the crimes are if you like.
1960.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6265.747,6267.5,What are they?
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6267.5,6273.287,The first was when he made a -- an application for naturalization in 1930.
1960.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6297.878,6301.492,Well I notice that he did not appear at the hearing before Judge Miner.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6301.492,6301.638,No.
1960.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6306.315,6306.898,He was ill.
1960.198,1,19054,charles_gordon,,6306.898,6312.999,"Yes, sir."

1960.198,2,16430,anna_r_lavin,,6326.423,6340.826,I'd like to refer first to what Mr. Gordon refers to as the overwhelming congressional background on the Act of this before the Court in the form of 2172.
1960.198,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6409.755,6424.111,Do I understand that the only distinction you can think of between a -- naturalized citizen and a -- and a native citizen is that only the latter probably can become President of the United States of America.
1960.198,2,16430,anna_r_lavin,,6424.111,6432.873,"Well, I -- the latter -- the former is also subject to divestment which they could never do with a -- a native-born citizen."
1960.198,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6437.227,6444.108,"Well, the -- and the native born citizen, this Court has held in certain circumstances, is subject to the denaturalizaiton."
1960.198,2,16430,anna_r_lavin,,6444.108,6444.789,A native-born citizen?
1960.198,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6444.789,6446.129,"Expatriation, yes."
1960.198,2,16430,anna_r_lavin,,6446.129,6446.982,"Oh, expatriation, of course."
