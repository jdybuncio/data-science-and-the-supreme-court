1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,18.573,22.244,Yes Your Honor.
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,22.244,25.308,"Mr. Blakeney, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,25.308,31.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,171.201,176.64,Are you able to draw in a dictionary distinction between those two words?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,176.64,184.667,I myself am not able to draw any distinction satisfactory to myself Your Honor.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.98,246.832,Your clients are -- who is -- Mrs. Moore and others?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,246.832,247.196,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.196,256.589,"I don't need to know their names, I'm rather just -- in that, but they are the parents of white public school children as well as of Negro public school children or only white public school children?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,256.589,257.666,Both Your Honor.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.666,259.161,Both.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,259.161,260.394,And the minor --
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,260.394,269.054,What do you do about the problem of disestablishing a jury segregated school system?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,269.054,274.273,"Your Honor that is of course a central subject that I will come to, but I will --"
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,274.273,275.521,In your own time?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,275.521,283.689,"I will answer it now if -- but I would prefer if I may because it is indeed of course the heart, the ultimate heart of the problem."
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,283.689,289.81,Because taking what you said literally then there is no power.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,289.81,292.909,"There is no power, we say Your Honor."
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,292.909,294.093,To disestablish?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,294.093,304.474,"No, there is no power to trample their constitutional right of any citizen in the disestablishing process."
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,317.829,323.49,"But if a person is -- we assume, he is caught in a ghetto that was established by the state?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,323.49,324.724,Yes.
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,324.724,328.595,And he is too -- he doesn't have the resources to get out.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,330.92,332.273,The constitution says (Voice Overlap) --
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,332.273,334.952,That nature take its course?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,334.952,340.288,"The constitution says to him, the constitution is expanded in Brown."
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.039,513.602,"Would you consider that the defendant, the constitution if the School Board not the Court, the School Board closed all of the entirely Negro schools and provided public transportation of the students of those schools into other schools to accomplish the dismantling as they saw it?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,513.602,527.175,We think that the constitution Your Honor cannot be said to require that any action be taken which has as its soul objective racial assignment.
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,527.175,528.163,Does it prohibit it?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,528.163,530.295,It prohibits it.
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.295,530.784,"In other words, your answer --"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,530.784,532.163,That's what Brown say.
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.163,544.035,Your answer to my question would be then that the School Board could not close these schools and transport the students out to other schools in the outlining districts?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,544.035,560.95,"If Your Honor in the operation of the schools on a natural geographic or other, non other -- non-racial basis such action came naturally, came normally, educationally, very well."
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.262,854.105,"Your argument is based entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and not at all on a federal statute, is it?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,854.105,855.04,Entirely.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.04,855.847,Entirely on the constitution?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,855.847,856.578,Yes.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.931,865.416,And your clients are the parents of school children.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,868.798,874.716,Parents and children -- the children themselves have by a proper process been made parties.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.716,883.85,And therefore you are making no claim with respect to the constitutionality vel non of the integration of faculty?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,883.85,886.274,No sir.
1970.444,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1160.271,1161.907,What is the --
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1161.907,1162.533,I beg -- pardon sir?
1970.444,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1162.533,1166.603,What is the longest distance this record shows?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1166.603,1173.202,There are distances of as much as 15 to 16 miles.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.089,1215.123,You don't really say that as a matter of that absolutely a school board never sent the child away from his neighborhood for any reason?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1215.123,1216.984,No I do not say that.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.314,1220.002,I suppose that they'd be a lot of good reasons to send the children away from neighbor.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1224.496,1227.321,Brown forbids doing so on account of race.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.321,1234.394,"And you say that gerrymandering, racial gerrymandering, pairing transportation or --"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1234.394,1234.854,(Inaudible)
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.854,1237.468,-- done on a racial basis are invalid.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1237.468,1238.671,Invalid.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.671,1245.534,And I suppose you would say the majority to minority transfer rule is equally invalid.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1245.534,1246.163,Indeed.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1250.12,1253.273,"Well, if there is no compulsion involved, would you still say it's invalid."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1253.803,1254.417,No sir. (Voice Overlap)
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.417,1256.582,-- attention were that it was a very compulsory assignments.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1256.582,1267.016,"These elements, governmental action, compulsory upon the child and shaped and based on no grounds, say race."
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.013,1290.666,"Well, if two children applied for a transfer under the majority to minority transfer rule and one of them is White and one of them is Black and the transfer is to a school with a White majority and a Black minority."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1295.702,1299.176,Yes Sir -- but --
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.176,1301.514,"The Black one will get the transfer, the White one won't?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1301.514,1302.323,"Yes, and that is --"
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.323,1306.444,Or the reverse if the transfer from a White school is requested.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1306.444,1309.499,And that is selectivity on the basis of race.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.499,1310.551,You say it's invalid?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1310.551,1313.295,I do prohibited by the constitution.
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1325.135,1330.677,I see that you told Justice Stewart that you didn't rely on it on any federal statute.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1330.677,1331.263,No sir.
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1331.263,1336.724,I see you cite the federal statute that it's in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1336.724,1364.645,"That is true Your Honor, but only for this purpose of showing that when it comes to the action of the elected representative of the people, this is not a constitutional point, but it is significant to know, no elected representatives of the people have ever enacted any legislation in the direction which we here oppose and which we say the constitution prohibits."
1970.444,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1401.119,1405.562,"Because the statute, do you think is restricted to de facto segregation rather than the jury?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1405.562,1406.786,No sir.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.179,1427.614,"Well, it issues a directive to federal judges."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1427.614,1427.845,Well --
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.845,1431.66,In the Sections in the 2006 (a).
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1431.66,1436.744,I think in the interpretation and administration of that statute is meant.
1970.444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.167,1468.732,Are you suggesting then that Green was improperly decided in the constitution?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1468.732,1470.416,No Your Honor.
1970.444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.374,1500.197,That's right.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1501.488,1503.329,Yes Sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1650.704,1656.33,What did Charlotte-Mecklenburg do for the 10-year period after Brown?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1658.365,1659.31,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.31,1661.69,What did they do for 10 years?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1661.69,1664.094,They moved gradually in the direction --
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.094,1665.461,Like what?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1667.955,1674.004,"The zoning, the attendance districting was made geographic --"
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.004,1675.062,When?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1675.221,1678.851,And -- in about 1963 thereabouts.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.851,1683.034,"Well, what did they do for the eight years after ‘55"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1683.034,1684.039,After Brown?
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.039,1684.52,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1684.52,1694.374,There was state statute in effect which did not fully take the hand of Government out of racial compulsion.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.397,1706.962,"And in ‘65, what you did was to draw boundaries and when you drew those boundaries, how much fixing did you get?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1706.962,1709.257,"A considerable degree of it, Your Honor."
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.257,1710.241,How much?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1710.241,1711.696,I cannot say the exact figures?
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.696,1714.241,"You said, it was very clear in the record."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1714.241,1716.778,"But I am saying this Your Honor if I may, --"
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.778,1717.337,That's it.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1717.337,1721.388,The test is not how much racial mixing occurs.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1735.515,1745.112,"Well, do you recognize that there is a need for Government compulsion to desegregate and setup a unitary system?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1745.112,1745.714,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1746.234,1747.908,Do you have any quarrel with that?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1747.908,1761.634,I recognize that there is a constitutional mandate that governmental action shall not bar any children from a school because of his race and shall not assign him to any on the basis of race.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.634,1763.596,That's not my question.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1773.932,1780.418,Affirmative action to take the hand of Government out of any racial compelling.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.418,1782.644,And just leave it as is?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1782.644,1789.633,"Once that governmental hand is removed and freedom is truly accorded, if it is, then the constitution is of aid."
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.633,1797.813,"My question is, you say just take the governmental hand off and let it stay like it is, is that your position?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1797.813,1798.247,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.368,1803.073,Would you still have the segregated system?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1803.073,1813.533,"The Government cannot go further and take the children by this “color” and say to them, you must go there and you must go there because of your race."
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.533,1817.599,What if the Government tell in Section 55.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1827.125,1828.587,The Charlotte authorities?
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.799,1830.433,The Government of North Carolina.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1830.433,1831.213,No sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1832.138,1835.071,"Well, you didn't have segregated schools?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1836.216,1842.386,We removed governmental action compelling segregation.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.252,1853.409,"You rely so much on Brown, but what about Green?"
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1853.409,1854.111,What about -- what?
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.111,1855.062,Green.
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1855.062,1857.833,The true meaning Green is consistent with Brown.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.934,1871.335,"Well, I don't think this Court reversed Brown, I'm just saying that Brown is a more recent case."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1871.335,1872.215,Green is more recent.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.215,1872.595,Green is?
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1872.595,1873.537,Yes sir.
1970.444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.537,1877.969,"And Green said, you can have pupil placement."
1970.444,0,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,1877.969,1890.833,"Green like Brown says, “You must accord true freedom” and that we say has been done here and I'll end with this if I may."
1970.444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.51,1952.93,Thank you Mr. Blakeney.
1970.444,1,46622,william_j_waggoner,,1965.578,1970.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.444,2,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2538.744,2542.392,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1970.444,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2623.544,2628.593,I presume you are saying segregation was outlawed whatever you called it?
1970.444,2,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2628.593,2632.965,That is correct Mr. Justice Black.
1970.444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.127,2918.345,Very well.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,2927.511,2931.185,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3021.874,3029.787,Where have you printed these statutes so that I can see the exact part of it which you say is unconstitutional?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3029.787,3055.515,"If you will turn Your Honor to the appellees' brief and there's Number 498, the brief for appellees', the first page of the argument which is -- it's quoted there in the footnote."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3058.486,3059.657,Number what?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3059.657,3061.4,The footnote at page 20.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3061.4,3061.929,20?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3061.929,3066.897,Page 20.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3071.714,3073.648,"And that is the part you are claiming, is that correct?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3073.648,3088.651,And then it's the only part that we attacked -- was the last two sentences in the second paragraph and they appear near -- over on 21 and then continuing in that footnote.
1970.444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.651,3090.135,Beginning those two (Voice Overlap)?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3090.135,3096.489,Those two sentences.
1970.444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.956,3155.886,I heard him the same way except for the because clause.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3161.106,3165.058,"Well, no, but because of the technique that the --"
1970.444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.058,3172.278,Because of the compulsion of people to attend certain schools or be a -- based on their race?
1970.444,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3172.278,3173.292,All he said that --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3173.292,3173.589,That's correct.
1970.444,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3173.589,3182.923,"-- was that in obeying the Brown decision in his opinion they went a little thing barred, that's all I understood he said."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3182.923,3183.819,Right.
1970.444,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3183.819,3188.22,And I didn't understand you saying the abandonment any of the arguments --.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3188.22,3199.932,"Well, I -- let me address that because I think that my point is, that his position is inconsistent and I hope to develop that in that part of my argument."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3199.932,3210.885,"Well, Mr. Nabrit, I'm looking at the statute and -- so I want to know which part of those sentences you say is unconstitutional?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3210.885,3216.565,The court below held that the both of the sentences were unconstitutional because --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3216.565,3220.83,"In that entire synopsis, no student --"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3220.83,3220.982,Yes.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3220.982,3225.662,-- will be assigned or compelled to attend any school on account of race.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3231.535,3232.995,"Yes it did, I think so."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3234.671,3243.392,No student should be compelled to attend or not attend a school on account of race was held unconstitutional?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3243.392,3254.761,"Mr. Justice Black, the court below held that that sentence, the whole sentence was unconstitutional including that clause and the next clause."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3254.761,3256.757,Do you think that part of it is unconstitutional?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3256.757,3264.141,Yes sir I do because it interferes with the school board's -- it imposes blinders on the school board.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3269.599,3272.456,"Well, that's what the constitution says."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3272.456,3272.487,"Well, --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.487,3274.736,And that's what we held.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3278.025,3282.576,"Well, but -- as I -- I understand that to be the argument, however --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3282.576,3290.876,"We‘re done with that argument, I thought that is what we had held in every case and that's what your client had been insisting on in every case."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3290.876,3321.008,"Mr. Justice Black, I understand the Brown case to hold that compulsory school segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the statute, the court below held in North Carolina where they still have school segregation, prevents the school board from doing its duty of abolishing that discriminatory system."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3321.008,3321.313,But this --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3321.313,3322.362,It tells the school board --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3322.362,3322.913,But this --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3322.913,3323.81,It tells the school board --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3323.81,3325.326,This provision of the statute --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3325.326,3325.778,Yes.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3325.778,3330.759,-- simply says that there shall be no discrimination.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3330.759,3331.286,"Well, the court --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3331.286,3332.522,-- the clause I've just read to you.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3332.522,3343.182,"Well, the court below didn't understand it that way and that's not the understanding that the state court judges gave it or that --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3343.182,3352.562,"Well, there's a saying that people can be compelled to go to a school or to refrain from going to a school because of their race."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3352.562,3360.178,"Mr. Justice Black, I think we cannot understand that sentence merely on the basis of that first clause, it says --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3360.178,3372.973,"Well at least that one is something and then if that's -- if the whole clause is held unconstitutional, I don't see any part of it can be based on that clause."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3372.973,3373.393,"Well, the statute was on --"
1970.444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3373.393,3389.163,"Mr. Nabrit, are you distinguishing in the application of the statute between its application and the abstract of that sentence and its application in the context of a remedy for what was stricken in Brown?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3389.163,3389.695,That's right.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3449.46,3450.849,Intent of whom?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3450.849,3453.535,The - that --
1970.444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3453.535,3453.987,You mean --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3453.987,3457.815,This is the way it's been applied by the North Carolina judges.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3462.405,3466.493,You're not I hope relying on -- have probing the mind of the legislature?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3466.493,3468.585,Not at all sir.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3468.585,3475.44,I can understand your --.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3475.44,3513.504,"May I say Mr. Justice Black that on this issue, the federal courts have been -- below have been entirely consistent that this sort of evasion of Brown cannot be permitted that an artificial assertion of non-discrimination of trapped cannot be permitted to stand in a way of actually accomplishing a reform of the segregated system."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3518.77,3522.062,"Well, I would of course reject to that from the beginning, absolutely."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3522.062,3524.871,And it's important that none of the argument on the other --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3524.871,3527.409,(Voice Overlap) by a subterfuge.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3530.534,3554.967,And that the statute is a subterfuge and that's what Judge Craven held and the court below held that it was a subterfuge.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3587.224,3592.731,Page number 281?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3592.731,3611.565,"At the -- page 24 of the appendix, Judge McMillan states, “The longest bus routes in the entire county are the routes by which four and five-year old kindergarten children are transported to child development centers.”"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3692.387,3692.471,Did that --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3692.471,3694.382,Now this is last October before the plan.
1970.444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3694.382,3709.355,"Did that -- the finding show -- did that finding show how far it would have been to the nearest school, nearer than the 79 miles trip?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3709.355,3709.761,The --
1970.444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.761,3711.067,Did it juxtapose those --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3711.067,3730.114,"That -- that's the -- those -- the Bayne Elementary finding which is ordinary elementary school, the busing was based on the school board's zones which are not drawn on the basis of proximity but drawn on the basis of discretion, but nevertheless they are the zones."
1970.444,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3790.237,3790.666,But not --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3790.666,3793.039,They are not merely --
1970.444,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3793.039,3800.255,"But not for the purpose of creating a balance or ratio of race, religion or national origin, you don't claim that do you?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3800.255,3801.883,"No, no, no, no."
1970.444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3801.883,3803.105,That's what this is directed to.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3803.105,3812.326,"Well, I was trying to state a few facts upon -- the background upon which this statute is enacted before I discuss its application."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3885.39,3905.885,"As I understood, I want to be sure quite about this, someone has argued as you are saying that the state would be without the power to pass a regulation doing away entirely with busing, the constitution would permit, is that your argument?"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3905.885,3911.311,"Mr. Justice Black, that argument is not necessary to --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3911.311,3914.182,It's our logic in this case --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3914.182,3916.683,It is -- it has not been made because we don't face any such facts.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3916.683,3918.632,I didn't see it.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3918.632,3933.418,"However, if that were to happen, the inquiry would have to be whether or not, it had a racially discriminatory effect."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3950.761,3978.417,"Well the reason I asked for it, I had always thought that was within the power of the state to operate schools or not as it so tendered without federal litigations and I would suppose that the State of North Carolina would repeal all its laws providing public schools that no one could insist that the federal constitution --"
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3978.417,3978.59,All this was --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3978.59,3981.283,And I think the same thing about busing.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3981.283,3987.658,The state's power is plenary unless it's the effect is to make a racial discrimination.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3997.854,4004.39,"Well, I thought the state's power was plenary to determine whether or not it had schools."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4004.39,4008.034,That's --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4008.034,4008.729,I didn't think we have any --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4008.729,4018.229,"Well, that that was the argument that was made where the -- in the Griffin case Your Honor where the school board abolished, they closed down all the public schools in (Inaudible) County."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4018.229,4023.28,But we found there was a discrimination now on account of not closing them all down.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4023.28,4030.485,"Well, that's the inquiry I'm suggesting would have to be made whether or not it's discriminatory."
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4051.091,4051.265,That was under Equal Protection --
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4051.265,4051.864,That's the same kind of --
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4051.864,4052.554,The equal protection?
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4052.554,4055.115,"That -- the equal protection, that's the only thing --"
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4055.115,4056.28,Under the state law.
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4056.28,4056.74,That's correct.
1970.444,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4056.74,4065.199,"What I was talking about was absolute abolition of public schools, I wouldn't think it could be any question about that."
1970.444,3,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,4072.952,4090.172,"In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the board's own figures and this is at page 619A of the Swann record, the record in number 281 show 10,414 elementary children last year rode buses."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7403.303,7407.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.444,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7416.346,7420.334,I think you have 13 minutes counsel.
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7420.334,7423.407,Thank you sir.
1970.444,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7423.407,7425.586,"If you find you'll need a little more, we'd extend that."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7425.586,7427.101,Thank you sir.
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7874.538,7899.386,"Mr. Blakeney, I take the case (Inaudible) no discrimination but it so happens that there are some white schools and some black schools in the city by whatever circumstance caused it, there are black schools and white schools and some black and white school."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7899.386,7900.154,Yes.
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7900.154,7913.345,"And the school board says to itself, “We think we'll have a better educational result right across the board, people will come out better citizens if they're educated together."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7955.466,7958.099,"I would say this to that, Your Honor, that --"
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7958.099,7959.967,"Well, is it -- yes or no?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7963.679,7974.948,I think that the protesting child is entitled to an inquiry as to whether or not the hand that drew the boundaries and they decided where that school should --
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7974.948,7983.589,All the school board says that we concede freely that the reason you aren't going here is because we want blacks and whites to go to school together.
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7983.589,7983.855,And --
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7983.855,7990.355,And the -- this is a racial -- to that extent it is a racial reason for the change.
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,7993.355,8001.183,"Your Honor, if there is anything in the natural geographic situation consistent --"
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8001.183,8019.604,"Nothing whatsoever in the geography that would indicate and they said, this used to be the first sixth grades here but it isn't going to be the first sixth grades anymore, its going to be the junior high school and you're going to have to go to grade school over here with all the rest of the -- with all the other people who are going to those grades."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8019.604,8021.008,Yes.
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8043.895,8052.247,"Well, the school board says, “We are -- we're going to force you against your will to be educated with members of the opposite race.”"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8060.47,8081.858,"I would say Your Honor that the sole test is what Brown laid down namely, look to inquire, look to see, is the action of Government here, is it bottom the point, shaped according to race and race alone, race alone --"
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8081.858,8082.104,Well --
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8082.104,8083.877,-- then it cannot be.
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8083.877,8091.591,"Well, the only -- the school board had really concedes, the only reason we're making this chain is to make sure that blacks and whites go to school together."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8091.591,8094.61,"Race alone -- then Brown does not permit it, Your Honor."
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8094.61,8098.993,Would you say that that's critically your position?
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8098.993,8099.878,In this case?
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8099.878,8100.913,Yes.
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8100.913,8105.984,We of course rest upon the exact facts of this case but the proposition generally --
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8105.984,8112.147,"But what if you are wrong on that, that a school board could do what I just described?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8112.147,8115.639,Then in this case they have not done so Your Honor.
1970.444,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8118.695,8126.948,"But lets assume the school board could do what I have described, consistently with Brown on the Fourteenth Amendment."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8136.998,8156.954,"I would say Your Honor where the facts are as here admitted, namely, we drew these lines for no reason except to include blacks or exclude whites or vice versa, we draw them for no reason than except that, it was not educational purpose that motivated us or move does here."
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8176.834,8181.664,"Mr. Blakeney, when was this bill passed, on ‘69?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8181.797,8183.191,The statute in question?
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8183.191,8184.9,"Yes, that the no busing bill, what month?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8184.9,8187.583,Yes.
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8190.353,8199.96,"Well, suppose that same bill had been passed in ‘55, we wouldn't have this problem, would we?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8199.96,8202.906,"We might indeed still have the same problem, Your Honor."
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8202.906,8213.689,"Well, isn't there a difference between when you passed this bill or do you admit that this bill was passed for the expressed purpose of upsetting the judgment of the District Court?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8213.689,8218.704,"No sir, the District Court orders were entered a year after this statute was passed."
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8218.704,8220.62,"Well, why was it passed?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8220.62,8229.67,This statute was passed to express the policy of the state as being the same as the decision of this Court in Brown.
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8229.67,8235.905,"Well, it was after the '65 decision of this Court, wasn't it, the District Court?"
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8235.905,8241.478,The District Court in ‘65 said that Charlotte-Mecklenburg was a non-racial system.
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8241.478,8241.795,If I was --
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8241.795,8243.677,And being operated non-racially.
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8243.677,8244.129,Well --
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8244.129,8244.683,And the Circuit Court upheld it.
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8244.683,8249.281,"Well, yes it's obvious it was after '65 because of the '69."
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8249.281,8251.68,"The statute was in 69, yes sir."
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8251.68,8256.271,And don't we have to consider it in that context.
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8256.271,8256.495,All I --
1970.444,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8256.495,8262.234,Not just as an ordinary statute that was passed 80 years ago?
1970.444,4,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,8262.234,8267.737,"Well, whatever context it be -- context would be considered in, Your Honor."
1970.444,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8318.706,8322.044,"Thank you, Mr. Blakeney, Mr. Waggoner, Mr. Vanore."
