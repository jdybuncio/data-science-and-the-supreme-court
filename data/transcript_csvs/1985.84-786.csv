1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,99.445,"Mr. Moss, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,99.445,103.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-786,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.828,350.577,"But, he did ask questions, didn't he?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,350.577,351.889,"Yes, he did ask questions."
1985.84-786,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,351.889,354.325,Do you think he elicited comments?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,354.325,377.129,"No, he did not elicit comments and the reason why he did not elicit comments is because those were statements that either Moulton was going to make anyway or that those questions that Colson asked were questions that Moulton required him to ask in order to develop the perjured testimony that Moulton wanted him to give."
1985.84-786,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,377.129,380.534,But your Supreme Judicial Court disagreed with it?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,380.534,398.637,"Yes, and the reason that our Maine Supreme Judicial Court disagreed is because our Maine Supreme Court assumed that simply by putting the body wire on the informant that the state somehow created the incriminating situation."
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.206,430.156,"If that evidence had been used against Moulton in the trial on his initial charge, would it have been admissible?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,430.156,433.046,The evidence of murder?
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,485.962,494.708,"If there were incriminating materials, could it have been used against Colson on his first charge?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,494.708,500.581,"Oh, yes, it certainly could have been, yes, against Colson."
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.581,502.204,If it was obtained afterward?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,502.204,505.0,Used against Colson?
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.0,506.219,"Colson, yes."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,506.219,506.703,The informant.
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.703,508.765,Maybe I have got my parties mixed here.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,508.765,513.466,Moulton is the defendant and Colson is the informant.
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.73,522.057,"Colson went to the Chief of Police, didn't he?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,522.057,522.698,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,522.698,527.087,And said he was threatened and wanted some protection among other things.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,527.087,527.4,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,527.4,545.894,"Mr. Moss, the Supreme Court of Maine found, as I recall, that Colson frequently pressed... I think that is the term used by the Maine Court... the respondent here to talk about the thefts."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,548.72,554.967,Those questions have to be put back in the context of this meeting itself.
1985.84-786,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,581.003,582.238,What page are we on?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,582.238,583.784,--Page seven of the respondent's brief.
1985.84-786,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,587.205,587.97,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,587.97,590.968,"And, Colson asks,"
1985.84-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.747,679.667,"If Colson did ask some questions and he elicited responses, did the state tell him to do that?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,679.667,682.666,"No, the state did not tell him to do that."
1985.84-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.666,684.009,Who set up the meeting?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,684.009,685.305,Moulton set up the meetings.
1985.84-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.305,688.413,But the state did put a wire on him?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,688.413,689.148,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.148,692.646,"But, they didn't... What did they tell him?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,692.646,698.971,"They told him to act like himself, converse normally, and avoid trying to draw information out of Moulton."
1985.84-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.971,702.283,"So, they didn't instruct him to ask questions?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,702.283,703.111,Correct.
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,703.111,713.684,"As a matter of fact, the Superior Court made an express finding that he was to avoid trying to draw information out of Moulton."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,713.684,715.528,"Yes, that is correct."
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.528,718.167,Very different from Massiah or Henry.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,718.167,718.464,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,718.464,725.304,"The police knew, as I recall, that respondent did have counsel?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,725.304,727.117,Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,727.117,730.084,"And, of course, he was not notified."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,735.536,736.691,"No, he had not."
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.158,742.017,"He was talking to the state, wasn't he?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,742.017,747.094,"--Yes, the defendant was talking to an agent of the state, yes."
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.094,747.844,All right.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,747.844,751.122,"But, there is no problem with that unto itself."
1985.84-786,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.956,945.887,"Do you think, counsel, that the Maine Supreme Court knew or should have-known-standard is really any different from creating a situation likely-to-induce standard in the Henry case?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,945.887,960.818,"Yes, it is, because the should-have-known aspect of the Maine Court standard seems to get away from the fact of whether the police were actually deliberately going after statements on the theft charges."
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1054.797,1058.264,What about the Mealer against Jones case?
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1058.264,1061.216,The state's position is--
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.216,1062.669,Judge Lombard's opinion.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1062.669,1066.072,--Is that the majority opinion?
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1066.072,1068.681,Judge Lombard's opinion.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1068.681,1080.52,"Well, Mealer versus Jones was incorrectly decided from the state's point of view, because there... Once again the government did not create the confrontation."
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.612,1091.657,"The government didn't create it, but the government knew what was going to be discussed."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1091.657,1092.313,--Yes.
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.608,1096.39,"But, you say that is not enough."
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1096.39,1097.498,--Correct.
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1117.147,1118.911,He got himself wired.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1118.911,1120.036,He got himself--
1985.84-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.036,1121.456,You said he didn't do anything.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1121.972,1134.124,"--To investigate the murder and he was obligated to investigate the murder and we have the finding below that that was the purpose of the body wire, to investigate the murder."
1985.84-786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.67,1252.935,"May I just ask one question, General Moss?"
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1274.863,1277.815,--That would be a more difficult case.
1985.84-786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.454,1284.813,I know it would be a more difficult case.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1292.857,1296.949,--We are relying on both of those factors in this case.
1985.84-786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1296.949,1298.386,I see.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1298.386,1300.182,We are not just relying on one or the other.
1985.84-786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.807,1302.275,All right.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1302.275,1316.55,"And, the reason for that is because the good-faith investigation itself into the new crime, that is what they used the body wire for, that helps to show that they were not actually eliciting or creating any situation with regard to the old crime."
1985.84-786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.55,1317.566,You refer to the investigation of the new crime.
1985.84-786,0,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1319.845,1321.924,"No, there were no charges brought on the new crime."
1985.84-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.115,1589.455,Very well.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1590.049,1598.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.758,1732.881,"Why do you use the term ""deliberately eliciting""?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1734.428,1753.747,I use that word because that is the term that is in the Massiah case to determine whether or not the police agent got certain evidence out of the defendant and it clearly applies in this case.
1985.84-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.747,1760.027,May I ask you a hypothetical extension on these facts?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1790.952,1805.758,"If this is a legitimate new crimes investigation, perhaps that evidence could be used on some potential--"
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.758,1807.944,"Well, your state foreheld that it could, didn't it?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1807.944,1808.709,--That is correct.
1985.84-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.709,1813.582,I was exploring your view of the matter.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1813.582,1823.017,The new crimes... The State of Maine found that this was a new crimes investigation.
1985.84-786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1944.389,1963.273,"Well, Mr. Beardsley, both the trial court and the Maine Supreme Court agreed that the state had a legitimate purpose in mind in investigating a new offense when it wired Mr. Colson for sound."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1988.372,1990.558,The state--
1985.84-786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.558,1997.93,In trying Mr. Moulton for the original offense?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,1997.93,2009.036,"--The state perhaps could use statements regarding the new crime if the trial judge found that they were not prejudicial or constituting uncharged misconduct, something along those lines."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.177,2089.254,"When did he become a government agent, Colson?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2093.034,2105.043,"Approximately three months prior to... Well, at the very beginning of November, he went to the police and these statements took place the day after Christmas."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.743,2121.303,"I know, but there were a lot of conversations between Moulton and Colson before even you would claim he was an agent of the state."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2121.303,2122.162,--That is correct.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.162,2130.455,"And, I suppose those statements would then... Colson certainly could have taken the stand and talked about them himself."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2130.455,2144.323,"He sure could have and he did and the trial court didn't believe a word he said because all the other... the other charge that was related, Perley Moulton was found not guilty on and the evidence they had was Colson's testimony."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.323,2150.931,"But, he could have testified as to the robbery charge."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2150.931,2154.226,The burglary and theft charge.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.226,2154.648,Yes.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2154.648,2155.242,"Yes, and he did."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.242,2159.349,"And, the earlier statements were not excluded?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2159.349,2162.192,I don't believe it was the earlier statements that he testified to.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.972,2193.086,"Of course, if the state had just said... If he had gone to the police and said... Suppose there wasn't any murder problem at all, no question about a new crime at all, and Colson just comes to them and says here is what Moulton is telling me to do, to testify to, and the police said, well, we are glad to listen to you."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2202.598,2207.862,"--In your fact situation, perhaps not, but in this fact situation--"
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.862,2209.611,Do you think the wire makes the difference?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2209.611,2219.825,"--The continued wire taps, the deal to cooperate and the taking advantage of their situation as far as they did."
1985.84-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2223.822,2230.07,Who initiated the conversation between the Chief of Police and Colson after Moulton had talked to Colson?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2230.07,2240.567,It is my understanding that Colson went on his own at the beginning to the Chief of Police.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.188,2254.483,He never set up any meetings?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2254.483,2255.592,--Colson?
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.592,2256.356,Yes.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2256.356,2257.809,He returned telephone calls.
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2297.87,2314.131,Supposing that Moulton had simply met... saw Colson regularly at an Elks' lodge every Tuesday night and just starting talking to him there about this previous crime he had committed and Colson goes to the police.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2326.047,2331.28,"I don't think that there is, but that is a lot different situation than we have here."
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.28,2333.654,What on earth could there be wrong with that?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2333.654,2337.964,I agree.
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.461,2351.632,Of a loose-lipped defendant.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2351.632,2352.663,--That is correct.
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.658,2362.329,"Well, you say arguably as though you think there is some argument on the other side."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2362.329,2372.138,"Well, in this case, they are taking advantage of the fact that Colson and Moulton have a common peril."
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.138,2381.604,Why can't the state take advantage of factors that happen to break its way so long as they don't violate some constitutional privilege.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2386.82,2400.141,"No, there isn't, but there is something that says that the state cannot deliberately elicit incriminating statements from an indicted defendant and that is exactly what they have done."
1985.84-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.907,2403.047,In your situation?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2403.047,2404.172,--In my situation.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.783,2443.297,"Well, suppose there was just no question at all but what... the state had instructed him not to ask any questions, but he did anyway."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2445.78,2450.826,I think that the state has to be responsible for the actions of their agents.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.558,2460.198,"Well, I don't know why you keep calling him an agent."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2470.755,2472.378,"--Well, I don't think so."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.753,2476.425,That may be so.
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2476.425,2487.716,"--Well, you have got something similar to the contingency fee agreement in that case where Colson is facing sentencing, he has got to produce and he hasn't produce."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.559,2543.991,"So, you say the state, even though they... On the assumption that they instructed him not to ask questions, the state is still disentitled to have responses to questions that Colson nevertheless asks?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2543.991,2552.049,--I think that the state is under an obligation to instruct their agent so that type of interrogation won't happen.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.108,2568.45,Although you agree the state certainly could have instructed him to ask the questions about the murder?
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2568.45,2572.511,"In a legitimate new crimes investigation, yes."
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.511,2575.665,"Which this was, which you agree it was."
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2575.665,2580.93,A new crimes investigation with fringe benefits that the state knew about.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.93,2589.097,"Well, if they had indicted him for this murder, everything he said about the murder could have been admitted against him?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2589.097,2589.487,Yes.
1985.84-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.279,2608.887,"So, could have been indicted for murder and he was on trial for murder, you could have used the statements and after that they try him for the robbery, they couldn't have used the statements?"
1985.84-786,1,15560,anthony_whitcomb_beardsley,,2608.887,2609.793,That is correct.
1985.84-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.134,2617.119,Very well.
1985.84-786,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2618.93,2620.946,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-786,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.188,2686.232,"What did the Court below hold was inadmissible, just the responses to interrogation or what, or all statements?"
1985.84-786,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2686.232,2686.668,All statements.
1985.84-786,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.178,2745.91,Is there anything in the record as to how experienced he was as an informant?
1985.84-786,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2745.91,2747.644,No.
1985.84-786,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2747.644,2748.644,How long he had been doing this?
1985.84-786,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2748.644,2753.048,"No, there is nothing in the record to indicate that he had been an informant in the past."
1985.84-786,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2835.358,2835.686,Very well.
