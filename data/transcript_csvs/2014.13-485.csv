2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument in Case 13485, Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,8.52,15.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.922,65.275,"Right, you're on the principle that life is not fair, right?"
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,65.275,69.16,Life is not fair.
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,84.17,95.393,"Well, but as as your friends on the other side point out in their example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,111.587,117.157,"Your Honor, let me try and explain why I why -- I disagree that it's unfair."
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,171.74,172.825,But that's the case now.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,189.784,191.803,"Well, I don't think we are, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.442,202.075,It is now.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,209.864,211.514,--I don't think we'd try.
2014.13-485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,222.671,225.54,"To be specific, you live in California."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,267.55,268.386,"--It is, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,268.386,268.902,Okay.
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.202,272.788,Move -- move to Hawaii is what you're saying.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,277.325,278.792,"Well, that's right, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.364,287.297,"--A lot are moving out of Maryland, too."
2014.13-485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.297,292.434,What is your best case that you can rely on for your answer to Justice Breyer?
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,296.32,299.272,--I wouldn't cite Complete Auto.
2014.13-485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.205,301.905,"No, I wouldn't if I were you trying to justify the answer either."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,306.692,323.986,"I might start with Jefferson Lines because it demonstrates that there are situations where only one claim State can claim to be taxing a value on the specific basis it is taxing it on, but many other States can be taxing it on a different basis."
2014.13-485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,328.122,330.39,Here in my hypothetical the basis is identical.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,364.495,372.401,Because California taxes the income from hot dog stands without regard to where the hot dog stand is located.
2014.13-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,381.34,392.648,The question is not whether California can tax the income of its residents wherever they make it or whether California can tax all income earned within the border of California.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,432.29,436.494,--I don't dispute the mathematics.
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.902,477.152,Yes.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,477.152,477.702,Every State--
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.702,486.09,"That's my problem, is I don't I understand why it is that California has to yield in this California-Hawaii situation."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,504.987,506.987,"--Well, there are good reasons--"
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.987,508.606,"I mean, as far as fairness is concerned."
2014.13-485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.247,531.704,"Your position your position is that the residents the domicile can tax worldwide income, period."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,549.6,561.141,"--I think that is the question, Your Honor: Must the State yield to another State's taxation of a portion of that income, but on a very distinct ground, a territorial ground?"
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.549,581.735,"Well, I was just going to say it's not a question of yielding."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,613.106,623.828,"Well, perhaps this is another way to address the internal consistency analysis and demonstrate why we think it doesn't do very much good analytic work here."
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.517,715.685,"That's not the Commerce Clause test, though."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,723.605,725.491,--The internal consistency test?
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.491,725.774,Yes.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,725.774,728.076,I think I -- think they have--
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.076,729.945,I thought it -- I thought it's a matter of state power.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,729.945,746.121,"--Well, I think this case does not present any issues that are unique to the Commerce Clause case, because it's undisputed that Maryland's tax does not facially discriminate."
2014.13-485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.642,791.917,"What about we're dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S corporation, but what about a corporation that is domiciled in Maryland?"
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,799.787,806.442,--We don't believe this case implicates any question of how corporations would be taxed.
2014.13-485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.602,831.158,"Well, I suppose you could argue that some states are very -- have very good corporation laws and that's why corporations are domiciled there."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,840.697,843.648,"--I think that's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,893.231,896.766,Can we go back to the Chief's initial question.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,914.062,937.677,"I don't believe we would because I think the proper construction of that test in this situation asks about the internal consistency of the rationale that Maryland is advancing, that is, are we being consistent in our structure -- in structuring our tax so that it reaches residents on their entire income regardless of whether it's earned."
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.677,941.312,I must say I am confused about what this case involved.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,975.218,977.052,Your Honor--
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.052,980.454,And I thought it was the latter that the case involves.
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,980.454,983.056,--We'd be willing to defend it under any provision of the Constitution.
2014.13-485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.558,986.058,"Well, that's big of you."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,987.36,1007.589,"--And the chief concern that this Court has articulated of its dormant Commerce Clause protection jurisprudence, that is, protecting against measures that are protectionist in nature and benefit in-staters at the expense of out-of-staters is not present here."
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1014.343,1015.927,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-485,0,56087,william_f_brockman,,1015.927,1016.693,I reserve.
2014.13-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1016.693,1016.96,Yes.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1028.349,1042.441,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin, if I could, by the interaction of taxes imposed on the jurisdictional rationale of residency, and taxes imposed on nonresidents by virtue of their doing business in the state."
2014.13-485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1077.097,1081.482,You only have to look at the tax scheme as a whole including the tax on nonresidents?
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1082.716,1091.272,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the very important thing to understand here is we're talking about two very different kinds of income taxes with distinct jurisdictional rationales."
2014.13-485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.582,1134.117,I thought that we held that quite a lot in respect to corporate taxes.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1150.643,1153.847,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that that's precisely what they hold."
2014.13-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1184.967,1189.269,When you say it seems a little bit of hairsplitting.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1223.675,1224.892,"Let me be as clear as I can, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1233.63,1235.399,But that's a due process argument.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1246.121,1247.973,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, if every State 6--"
2014.13-485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1247.973,1249.107,"I mean, that is the question, isn't it?"
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1249.107,1252.992,"--Yes, I think that is part of the analysis of the question."
2014.13-485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.319,1272.805,"Except if they also imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes the whole scenario."
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1272.805,1273.739,"That's right, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1335.294,1347.935,"In your answer that you gave to my the hypothetical of 100 percent, that would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce, because a resident who did not go into interstate commerce would pay less, so there is a burden."
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1351.987,1363.977,"So, Your Honor, there is in some cases, a Maryland resident will be taxed more on commerce that they conduct outside of Maryland then inside of Maryland, but I don't see why that's discrimination attributable to Maryland."
2014.13-485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.641,1387.327,Justice Kennedy asked a question I was curious about.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1406.638,1410.773,"Well, Your Honor, I've explained to explains why if someone has to be at fault, I think it's the nonresident tax."
2014.13-485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1411.792,1413.558,I don't see anybody at fault.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1425.033,1436.84,"--Well, Your Honor, it wasn't 6 Your Honor, just quickly on J.D. Adams, in addition to it not being a domicile-based tax, it was a tax on gross receipts, which are taxes on transactions and the entire revenue of those transactions."
2014.13-485,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1439.209,1448.998,"Well, just to understand what you said a minute ago, are you saying that if this same claim were brought by a nonresident challenging the nonresident tax in Maryland that would succeed?"
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1448.998,1450.115,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.13-485,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1456.654,1457.037,All right.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1462.939,1464.358,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it's irrelevant."
2014.13-485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.069,1484.202,But they are linked they are linked together.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1499.462,1505.55,"--Well, Maryland has upheld the special nonresident tax, not on the ground that it's not discriminatory."
2014.13-485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1623.443,1638.036,"--Mr. Feigin, if we were to rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same position as Maryland, either because they do a county tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions to impose their own taxes?"
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1638.036,1644.44,"I'd look at pages 17 to 18 of the Municipal Lawyers Association brief, Your Honor, but if I could add just one quick sentence beyond that."
2014.13-485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.364,1660.316,I have one more question.
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1671.274,1673.158,There are limits.
2014.13-485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.479,1687.467,"In and of itself, it wouldn't violate the negative foreign commerce clause, right?"
2014.13-485,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1688.385,1692.104,"--I think if it did, Your Honor, Congress could legislate that out of existence."
2014.13-485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.837,1693.873,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1698.941,1701.227,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1751.074,1758.411,"When you do business in California and you live somewhere else, your hot dog stand is going to be subject to pretty high property taxes."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1793.901,1804.291,"My response is that in cases like Container Corp., Jefferson Lines, and others, this Court has said: Look, we can't and don't want to constitutionalize everything about State taxation."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.389,1838.213,"Mr. Perella, suppose we had a Maryland resident and all that resident's income is earned out of State."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1866.716,1869.168,"Justice Ginsburg, a couple of responses to that."
2014.13-485,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.472,1904.324,"Maybe -- no, maybe so, and maybe -- maybe not so."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1919.084,1923.885,"Well, I disagree respectfully, Justice Kennedy, that he's getting a free ride."
2014.13-485,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.489,1932.341,But he's getting a free ride off Maryland school.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1934.276,1934.993,Two answers.
2014.13-485,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.472,1953.688,Can there be some minimum tax imposed on a resident?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1953.688,1955.774,--Minimum--
2014.13-485,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.774,1965.479,"In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, 100 percent of the income is earned from out of State, and has five kids go to school, and they use all of the local facilities."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1968.497,1977.37,"--I think the short answer to that is if it's an income tax, no, under your hypothetical, which is that he earns no income inside the State."
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.937,1980.655,What about a school support tax?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,1980.655,1985.976,"--You know, I think that it's possible that you could impose a school support tax, but then what--"
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.976,1987.343,Can you give me the right numbers in what you said?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2008.656,2009.158,"--No, Justice Breyer--"
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.158,2009.474,What?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2009.474,2012.96,"--to be clear, every other State has a credit, a full credit unlike the one--"
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2012.96,2014.043,So every other State.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2016.162,2016.962,--It's 42 States.
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.962,2017.847,42 States.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2026.284,2026.501,Zero.
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.501,2027.403,Zero?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2027.403,2031.438,Wisconsin has a limitation on its credit as one of the topside briefs points out.
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2038.858,2039.775,"Well, Maryland does--"
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2039.775,2043.829,"Well, don't some States allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a credit?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2048.148,2048.748,Yes.
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2082.804,2089.391,"--But you recognize that there are jurisdictions, local jurisdictions, that impose a tax and don't give a credit?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2089.391,2090.008,--I think it's fair--
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.008,2090.477,Just like this one.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2090.477,2092.16,--I think it's fair to say that there are some.
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2095.028,2096.028,But before you said there were zero.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2096.028,2098.313,"No, sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.8,2107.852,"Well, Maryland does allow the credit against the State income tax."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2109.787,2118.474,"Well, I mean, not to split hairs, but as this case comes to the Court, you know, the State courts have held, and Maryland hasn't disputed, that this is, in fact, a State income tax."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.126,2121.393,Yes.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2128.515,2142.106,"I think the key point here is that if you conceive of this all as a State tax, which is how, again, how the Maryland law stands and how the case comes to the Court, what Maryland has done here is say we're going to arbitrarily cut our credit essentially in half."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2158.035,2167.823,"Mr. Perella, you're not saying that we have to or that we should establish a priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do -- are you?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2173.227,2187.402,"--I think that the holdings of this Court in Standard Oil, Mobil Oil, Central Railroad, are that in a situation where one State is taxing on the basis of residency and the other on the basis of source, it is the State of residency that yields."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2187.402,2190.004,So you are saying that that's the priority rule.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2190.004,2193.206,"Well, I'm saying that in the case where there is the risk of overlap, yes."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2209.649,2216.419,"Well, let me ask you: I mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is not okay, but then States could choose."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2241.203,2254.361,"So I think that if you had that situation, and of course you don't because all the States do this the same way, but if you had it, I think there would be an argument to be made that that tax would be unconstitutional because it would produce massive double taxation."
2014.13-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2271.403,2275.271,But it's only internally inconsistent because of the special nonresident tax.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2281.608,2289.362,"The reason you have to worry about it in this case -- and let me say, Mr. Chief Justice, there are other ways to -- to rule in our favor without doing internal consistency."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.845,2329.172,"A resident -- you're not disputing the proposition that the State of residence can tax worldwide income, can impose an income tax on its residents worldwide, wherever they earn it."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2330.922,2332.624,--I'm not questioning that as a matter of due process.
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2332.624,2335.593,"Well, as a matter of what?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2345.364,2348.833,Would I question it as a matter of the Commerce Clause?
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2365.295,2369.314,"Well, then what you're saying is they don't have the power to tax worldwide income--"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2369.314,2369.98,"--No, that--"
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2369.98,2373.634,--if another State has a tax based on source.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2386.775,2388.81,"--Two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.166,2428.952,You talked about what this Court has been doing for I don't know how many years.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2460.156,2460.656,Yes.
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2460.656,2461.439,--rather than an outsider?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2461.439,2464.208,"There are -- there are a number of cases, and let me give them to you."
2014.13-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.978,2498.449,"Well, one thing, one obvious distinction is the corporation doesn't have five children to send to school."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2498.449,2502.5,"--Well, you know, I think that that rationale maybe proves a little bit too much."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2574.03,2586.587,"Mr. Perella, we said in this American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it violated internal consistency."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2600.247,2603.466,"Well, I guess several responses, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2613.405,2617.526,"I'm sure that if you aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of money, too."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2617.526,2617.992,"Well, maybe."
2014.13-485,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.94,2695.492,Why should that give me comfort?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2699.894,2700.627,"--Well, I don't think it makes--"
2014.13-485,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.627,2704.947,Where the only way out is to -- is to -- I don't understand the argument.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2704.947,2707.982,"--Justice Scalia, Maryland can close the gap however it likes."
2014.13-485,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.415,2710.034,That's what I think.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2710.034,2711.434,--It can raise the income tax 22 generally.
2014.13-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2794.521,2802.36,"What if they didn't do it on gross income, but just said every resident has to pay X amount?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2802.36,2805.329,As an income tax?
2014.13-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2805.329,2807.062,As an income tax.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2807.062,2809.781,I think the result would be the same.
2014.13-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2809.781,2811.633,It's not being based on gross income.
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2816.787,2828.944,"Justice Sotomayor, I think the result would be the same because -- and as I stand here, I'm thinking about this -- I believe it would be the same because the question would be, as the Chief Justice points out, is the tax internally consistent."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2836.698,2841.919,"But why doesn't Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as the American Trucking hypothetical?"
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2850.608,2865.285,"I think -- I think that the thing about American Trucking that made it unique, Justice Kagan, and I confess I don't completely understand the rationale of American Trucking, but I think the thing that makes it unique is it's a flat fee for use of the State services."
2014.13-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2867.569,2874.723,"I thought that that was what Justice Sotomayor was positing, a flat fee for use of the State schools and everything else that comes along with being a State resident."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2874.723,2875.023,All right.
2014.13-485,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.837,2931.072,"But, you know, there -- there's an inequity either way."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,2957.739,2959.975,"Three responses, if I could, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.307,2999.635,"That's quite interesting, because New York City's normal population, I think now we have gone down to 7 million, but out-of-state residents that come in are 25 million a day, who work in the city."
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,3005.889,3017.014,"I'm not sure totally sure how the New York City income tax regime works, Justice Sotomayor, but I think the point I was driving at is, you know, States have different policy preferences."
2014.13-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.216,3020.916,What's your third?
2014.13-485,2,56088,dominic_f_perella,,3020.916,3026.72,"--Yes, that's what I was getting the line is drawn at the idea that you can't double tax."
2014.13-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.464,3098.232,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-485,3,56087,william_f_brockman,,3101.101,3104.386,Thank you.
2014.13-485,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3321.226,3321.409,Thank you.
