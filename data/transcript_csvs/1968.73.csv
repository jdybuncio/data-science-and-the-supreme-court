1968.73,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.571,"Number 73, Robert Newton Gardner, Jr., Petitioner versus California."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,13.873,17.3,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.512,217.392,"You say that is theoretical, that is fact; isn't it; in other words and it works."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,239.12,282.542,"That is true Mr. Justice Stewart but in practice it seems to me we have to look at the California procedure and see how it usually works and I think we will see that is very much like an appellate procedure in the usual case and of course even if it isn't I think the petitioner has shown his need for that transcript to prepare for the appellate court review, but if I might I'd like to point out that even though the petitioner is theoretically able to proceed and either the Superior Court or the Appellate Courts of California in an original proceedings, as a general matter and the usual practice as established in the State's brief here as referred to, is that the Appellate Courts will require him to start in the trial court."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.895,289.864,That's not unlike the Federal system I expect.
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,289.864,290.576,That's right.
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.576,326.111,"Where I think I'm right in saying that under the statute an original writ of habeas corpus could be brought either to Federal District Court or before a Circuit Judge or the whole Court of Appeals or before any Justice or before this whole Court, but the practice is that it's authorized by the statute of Federal system to transfer any such applications filed in the particular Circuit Judges or Supreme Court Justices to transfer it to the District Court, is that more or less the California practice?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,326.111,343.152,"I believe the more common practice is to deny the application for habeas corpus, it's referred to a footnote in the State's brief on the ground that he should proceed in the trial court, absent some unusual circumstances of the trial court would not act."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.152,353.923,"Of course in the Federal system, there is provision for appeals from denials of habeas corpus and as I understand it in California there's no appeal from a denial."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,353.923,356.349,There is an appeal by the State if the petition is granted.
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.349,359.572,"No, I'm not appealed for the denial asset of habeas corpus is that correct?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,359.572,362.447,"Well, that is correct."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.758,400.825,"Well, as I read your trial judge's order, he may clear that the appellate court if it so minded was free to ask for the transcript of what had gone on in the habeas corpus proceeding in the Trial Court, didn't I read that correctly, I don't have it."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,400.825,403.84,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,429.589,433.027,Which transcript was necessary for him to have?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,433.027,438.504,The transcript of the hearing on a petition for habeas corpus in the trial court.
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,438.504,445.24,You're not asking that the Government supply that the State should supply the transcript of the original trial?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,445.24,446.28,No sir.
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,465.957,479.154,"Mr. Rickershauser, do you know whether this procedure that my brother Stewart was talking about is peculiar to California whether there are other States and if so how many?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,494.92,497.654,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Fortas I do not know the answer to that question.
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,505.596,507.973,"I would be interested in having that, yes."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,507.973,511.233,Alright.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.711,531.49,"Well, could you tell me whether I gather from what you say that sometimes there are hearings in the Supreme Court."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,531.49,531.884,That's correct.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.884,538.543,"When you file a new petition in the Supreme Court instead of appealing, sometimes as a hearing."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,538.543,539.372,It's correct Mr. Justice White.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.372,555.495,"Now, why wouldn't you, if they wouldn't give you the transcript of what occurred in the lower court, why wouldn't you ask for a hearing, so you could make a record and give the -- put the evidence before the Court of -â€“ the Supreme Court of California."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,555.495,557.861,We would ask for a hearing and as depending --
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.861,563.421,But you think that you have -- are you claiming the constitutional right not to have to ask for that hearing?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,563.421,569.887,"No, I am claiming that in order to get that hearing it is necessary to have this transcript."
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.887,570.913,Why is that?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,570.913,577.706,Because as both in aid of preparation of the petition for the hearing and in proving to the court --
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.706,585.022,"You prepared the petition for the hearing, petition without such a transcript in the lower court and got a hearing on it?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,585.022,586.397,That's correct.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.674,591.984,"Well, I understand but the petition was filed in the lower court and then a hearing on it."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,591.984,592.588,"That's right, that's correct."
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.588,607.057,"Now, is there any reason to suspect that you couldn't have got a hearing in the Supreme Court of California, if the Supreme Court of California refused to call up the record from the lower court."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,607.057,613.114,"I am not sure I follow your question is, the Supreme Court of California does not have to grant a hearing on the petitions."
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.114,616.351,"It's true, but it's never been denied yet is it?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,616.351,616.993,"Yes, it has."
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.063,620.467,But did you ever ask them for a hearing?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,620.467,621.614,Yes.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.614,632.153,"And they, so that -- you'd come here with, you come here in a situation where they wouldn't call up the record in those kind of court and wouldn't give you a hearing."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,632.153,634.115,That is correct.
1968.73,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.164,644.786,And neither did the Supreme Court of California --
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,644.786,649.203,That's right.
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.203,657.681,Where does that show in the record that the Appellate Court denied a hearing on your application?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,657.681,666.551,"Well, the only proceeding that's before the court in this case is the request for the hearing."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.415,700.442,"I thought what we had here and perhaps not quite wrong, I thought what we had here was simply the denial of the trial court to supply your client a free transcript of the hearing to be used by him in his new application for habeas corpus in the appellate court."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,702.412,719.113,"Well it's really arguable I guess what you have before you because the petitioner took that denial to the California Court of Appeal by writ of certiorari and then took that to the Supreme Court of California by petition for a hearing, both of which were denied."
1968.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,745.095,767.045,"But this case is an attack, is it not upon the denial of the trial court by request for a free, for a free transcript of the habeas corpus proceedings in the trial court to be used by your client, he says necessary for him to have in order to file an application for habeas corpus in the appellate court?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,767.045,777.574,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,907.829,931.548,"Mr. Rickershauser, do you know what happens in the Supreme Court of California when a habeas petition is filed, and the court decides to hear it, does the court hear it, suppose the evidence has to be taken, do they ever take evidence before the court, do they appoint a master?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,931.548,942.928,"My understanding Mr. Justice Fortas is that a master is appointed or a referee, and that a transcript is obtained of that proceeding, which is then reviewed by the court to the extent necessary to reach a decision."
1968.73,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,942.928,950.275,hey don't customarily then rely on the transcript of the lower courts?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,950.275,964.8,"Well there are circuit court, Court of Appeals cases in which they have relied on it, and I am sure they would in this case had they granted a hearing because the petitioner doesn't seek to establish anything beyond that transcript."
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.297,1045.056,"I am looking at the appendix page 22 that apparently is the order in the Supreme Court of California, titled petition for hearing, order denying hearing."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1059.519,1062.844,Mr. Justice Brennan I am not with you on page 22 --
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.844,1063.298,62.
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1063.298,1064.463,62 I am sorry.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.463,1067.366,62 and 63.
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1067.366,1076.566,I think I mentioned a few moments ago that it is not actually clear from an arguable standpoint as to what is here.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1080.838,1095.006,"Now may I just, just ask there looking at page 50, that would appear to be to the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari, is that it in the district court?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1100.933,1103.285,That is the order of the Court of Appeals.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.285,1111.134,"Now is that what this --our writ ran to, to that order and not to the order of page 62 of the Supreme Court of California?"
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1111.134,1127.65,Mr. Justice Brennan your writ ran to the order of the Superior Court on page 43 of the appendix.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.65,1130.264,"43, is that denying a transcript."
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1130.264,1131.36,That's correct.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1131.36,1134.159,And you appeal that order?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1134.159,1146.732,"That order will take Court of Appeals in California by writ of certiorari under the procedures of that state, on which there is no decision establishing that that's either the correct or the incorrect procedure."
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.875,1151.93,That's where you ask for a hearing?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1151.93,1152.5,That's right.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.5,1158.996,In the Supreme -- that's like petitioning for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California.
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1158.996,1160.093,I am sorry.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1160.093,1160.233,You asked --
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1160.233,1178.59,"In the petition for certiorari, we asked for the supplying of the transcript below and I assume there would be a hearing, now the procedure in the California Supreme Court is a petition for a hearing, which has the discretionary aspects of a petition for certiorari here."
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.59,1186.292,In other words this is not something -- that petition for hearing in the Supreme Court of California is not something peculiar to the state habeas corpus?
1968.73,0,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,1186.292,1187.204,No sir.
1968.73,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.907,1191.156,"That's all right, now I am getting."
1968.73,1,33521,jack_k_weber,,1581.871,1584.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please to court."
1968.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1627.626,1633.781,"You are talking about an appeal from a denial of habeas corpus, you are not talking about an appeal from a conviction?"
1968.73,1,33521,jack_k_weber,,1633.781,1635.82,"That's right, yes sir."
1968.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.192,1745.614,"Can you file a petition in habeas in the trial court and the allegations being by the trial court such as making a hearing in the trial court, to repeat identical allegations filed either in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court either those courts may claim the insufficiency of the --"
1968.73,1,33521,jack_k_weber,,1745.614,1748.438,That's correct Your Honor yes.
1968.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.992,1765.498,"That's the way it works, there is no appeal whether you are right or wrong, what the trial court did or (Inaudible) Court of Appeals or --"
1968.73,1,33521,jack_k_weber,,1765.498,1785.536,"Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's not reviewable there are rare cases in which the appellate court has determined that there was some error in a collateral attack proceeding in the court below but the usual practice is to treat the whole matter a new and it's a de novo proceeding and I guess namely it's just --"
1968.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.536,1809.057,"Well, in a hearing -- concludes in the hearing and fact finding was handed against the petitioner, nevertheless may the petitioner file that same complaint in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court and perhaps get another hearing even though this may result in the perhaps a contrary fact find?"
1968.73,1,33521,jack_k_weber,,1809.057,1817.758,"That's the way it's done, as a matter of fact, he isn't bound by the substantial evidence rule or any of the other customary rules relating to appeal."
1968.73,2,31944,justic_marshall,,1829.564,1836.246,How can a Supreme Court find an error in the record below if it doesn't have the record?
1968.73,3,33521,jack_k_weber,,1836.246,1849.693,"Well of course when it proceeds by allegations it doesn't need to find error in the court below, they just test the sufficiency of the allegations and determine the original substantive claim anew."
1968.73,4,31944,justic_marshall,,1863.562,1873.926,"How can it determine that he is not entitled to have those allegations considered if it doesn't have the record upon, which they're based?"
1968.73,5,33521,jack_k_weber,,1873.926,1900.343,"Well, now we're getting into the second stage of the habeas corpus procedure which relates to proof, he would go to the appellate court, he would set out his allegations about what went wrong in the court below and if the court deemed those allegations sufficient, then it would get into a question of getting the transcripts and establishing the truth of those claims."
1968.73,6,31944,justic_marshall,,1900.343,1907.646,"And if it doesn't find those allegations sufficient, what course does the Supreme Court take?"
1968.73,7,33521,jack_k_weber,,1907.646,1912.565,It denies the petition.
1968.73,8,31944,justic_marshall,,1913.245,1917.295,"Doesn't have, then it doesn't have an independent hearing of its own?"
1968.73,9,33521,jack_k_weber,,1917.295,1920.041,"Well, it holds an independent hearing."
1968.73,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.243,1957.037,"Well if the, if they -- Supreme, if this in the Supreme Court Mr. Weber, and it's finally concluded that there has to be live testimony taken before someone, before whom is it heard?"
1968.73,9,33521,jack_k_weber,,1957.037,1975.946,"It's a referee, I think I've cited the Riddle case in my brief where the court describes this procedure and then a transcript is prepared and the court receives the report of the referee and then it re-determines and reweighs the referees' findings, giving them great weight but not being bound by that."
1968.73,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1975.946,1978.794,Is that also true in the intermediate court of appeals?
1968.73,9,33521,jack_k_weber,,1978.794,1979.139,"Yes, sir."
1968.73,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.139,1980.411,Reference to a referee?
1968.73,9,33521,jack_k_weber,,1980.411,1980.774,Yes.
1968.73,10,31944,justic_marshall,,1980.774,1990.149,"Mr. Weber, in this original paper that the petitioner files, I assume the State files a response."
1968.73,11,33521,jack_k_weber,,1990.149,1993.097,"If the request that, yes, Your Honor."
1968.73,12,31944,justic_marshall,,1993.097,1997.54,"Well, would the State view the transcript?"
1968.73,13,33521,jack_k_weber,,1997.54,2000.209,It depends on the nature of the allegations.
1968.73,14,31944,justic_marshall,,2009.933,2012.063,But the petitioner couldn't getâ€”
1968.73,15,33521,jack_k_weber,,2012.063,2013.489,That's one of those allegations.
1968.73,16,31944,justic_marshall,,2013.489,2016.178,-- the transcript?
1968.73,17,33521,jack_k_weber,,2016.178,2023.616,"Well, if he has the, of course if he has the â€“ of course he doesn't have the means, he can't buy the transcript, he'd have to make some request to the Court to secure it."
1968.73,18,31944,justic_marshall,,2023.616,2029.983,So the State would use transcript because the State I assume has the means.
1968.73,19,33521,jack_k_weber,,2029.983,2032.032,"Well, we still have a few dollars, and yes."
1968.73,20,31944,justic_marshall,,2032.032,2040.191,"So the State would use the transcript for its pleadings, but would deny the transcript to the pauper."
1968.73,21,33521,jack_k_weber,,2040.191,2049.761,"Well, there's always a process of testing out these claims and when then the Court requests a response, the State could secure a transcript."
1968.73,22,31944,justic_marshall,,2066.965,2085.608,Isn't it worse when pauper without a lawyer is up against the weight of the whole prosecuting authority of the State of California plus the transcript?
1968.73,23,33521,jack_k_weber,,2085.608,2098.239,"Well, I usually feel that the situation is turned around and that the petitioners are the ones who are putting us on the spot through their allegation."
1968.73,23,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.876,2134.92,Don't you do though on direct appeals from conviction?
1968.73,23,33521,jack_k_weber,,2134.92,2138.604,"Well, as this Court has pointed out there's a difference between direct appeals and --"
1968.73,23,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.604,2140.889,"Well, I know but what about my question?"
1968.73,23,33521,jack_k_weber,,2140.889,2143.16,We do furnish free transcripts on the direct appeal.
1968.73,23,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.16,2144.322,Automatically?
1968.73,23,33521,jack_k_weber,,2144.322,2146.734,"Automatically, yes."
1968.73,23,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.734,2146.915,Without any --
1968.73,24,31944,justic_marshall,,2146.915,2148.504,Whether they have money or not?
1968.73,25,33521,jack_k_weber,,2148.504,2155.283,"Whether they have money or not, yes Your Honor, California is very liberal in doing that."
1968.73,26,31944,justic_marshall,,2155.283,2172.896,"Let me ask you this Mr. Weber, if this man had the money and had purchased the transcript, could it have been used in the Supreme Court to determine whether he was entitled to hearing that?"
1968.73,27,33521,jack_k_weber,,2172.896,2182.725,"Well, the court customarily receives any documents that petitioners send it and they will make use of those documents, yes."
1968.73,28,31944,justic_marshall,,2182.725,2187.714,"Then if he, if he isn't able to get that then the Court would have used it."
1968.73,29,33521,jack_k_weber,,2191.365,2201.223,"Well, we don't deny that there's some difference between the way that indigents are treated here and between the powers of the State to secure a transcript."
1968.73,30,31944,justic_marshall,,2206.757,2214.697,"Well, how is that justified, how, on the part of the State?"
1968.73,31,33521,jack_k_weber,,2214.697,2218.077,The justification for requiring him --?
1968.73,32,31944,justic_marshall,,2218.077,2220.634,For the discrimination that you just mentioned.
1968.73,33,33521,jack_k_weber,,2220.634,2231.33,"Well, the justification would be in the economic cost in furnishing the transcripts without some test or need."
1968.73,34,31944,justic_marshall,,2231.33,2247.252,"It seems to me in a State like California that wouldn't be very good argument because if the man is a millionaire and he has a long trial, the State pays for his transcript on appeal?"
1968.73,35,33521,jack_k_weber,,2247.252,2249.38,Yeah.
1968.73,36,31944,justic_marshall,,2249.38,2264.336,Why shouldn't an indigent have it in a situation like this if a man of means could have the transcript and it would be used by the Court in determining the merits of the case?
1968.73,37,33521,jack_k_weber,,2264.336,2278.555,"Well, I think that perhaps the best answer to Your Honor's question is that the indigent has an effective procedure apart from having the transcript, he can describe it all to the Court in his allegations if he feels he wants to do so."
1968.73,38,31944,justic_marshall,,2278.555,2282.486,Layman without a lawyer?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2282.486,2297.239,"Well, he did file a petition in the Superior Court which gained him the hearing, we feel that that's an adequate test to demonstrate that he would be able to do the same thing in the appellate court."
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2297.239,2316.442,"Well, his hearing came to a -- not in the Superior Court and the Court in some instances, the Supreme Court in some instances will review that transcript to determine whether there was error in it, why shouldn't he have the opportunity to have that before the court?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2316.442,2322.115,"Well, because we need some test to curb waste in these areas and some test --"
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2322.115,2323.162,Curb what?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2323.162,2335.987,"Waste in these areas because if we gave all of these transcripts out whether the indigent needed them or not, it could cause a wasteful system."
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2335.987,2340.96,Just pecuniary matter insofar the state is concerned.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2340.96,2360.914,"Well, of course if human resources were unlimited and funds were unlimited, we would be able to provide indigent prisoners with all that they wanted in the way of transcripts in many other problem areas too."
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2360.914,2373.471,"How often does the State Supreme Court have a master upon it or referee upon it, is that a matter of common practice or is it very rare?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2373.471,2388.89,"I would say that it's a fairly common practice, one can pickup almost any volume of the California Supreme Court reports and it will have two or three such hearings reported in it."
1968.73,39,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.89,2398.833,"Do you know Mr. Weber the answer of the question or not, Mr. Justice Fortas just asked whether other states have the same procedure?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2398.833,2425.13,"I made a very quick canvas of laws of the other states and there are a few, I think there's about five or so that still retain the common law procedure, many of the others have adopted by statute an appeal procedure, some others have converted writ review procedures into something that is virtually or equivalent to an appeal."
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2435.741,2446.291,"But at the time this appellate procedure was established in California, habeas corpus did not have the scope that it has now, did it?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2465.885,2467.065,"It's very true Your Honor, the California --"
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2467.065,2468.897,"Now, that's been expanded in more recent years."
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2468.897,2474.355,California has directly expanded the writ of habeas corpus to protect the rights of the prisoners.
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2474.355,2482.312,But this right to a transcript has not been expanded in accordance with that different procedure.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2482.312,2504.811,"Well, we feel that the right to transcript is adequate at the present time in order to fully protect the real rights of the prisoners, well at the same time providing some kind of a screening procedure to take off waste and needless requests and so on."
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.811,2520.159,"A moment ago, a moment ago you referred to what would go on in the Supreme Court of California after the petitioner files his petition for habeas corpus there after it is denied in the lower court."
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2530.154,2534.493,"Yes he could if he desired to do so, write out his own bill of --"
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.493,2551.786,"Well, as a matter of practice, if I petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court and I am denied after a hearing and then I file petition for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California, well in the Appellate Court and then the Supreme Court."
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2576.391,2579.166,The issue in order to show cause usually--
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.166,2579.571,And then what happens?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2579.571,2588.32,Appoint counsel for petitioner and then the state will file its return to it and answer the--
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.32,2597.674,"Well, the Supreme Court of California at that point if they think that they need some that if there is some; they need to find out whether these allegations are true or false."
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2602.42,2606.58,I don't recall any cases off hand where they have called for the transcript.
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.58,2621.557,So if their exclusive method of resolving evidentiary conflicts in the Supreme Court on petitions for habeas corpus where the state and the petitioner cannot agree from the facts.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2631.104,2644.944,"That's generally speaking true although it's possible that one of the parties will supply a transcript of what occurred to the court, so that it can use that in making determinations of the fact."
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.944,2658.419,"And if, but I don't suppose that if either party refused to accept that transcript, I suppose there would have to be a new hearing?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2658.419,2667.319,"Well, I don't know of any cases in which the California Supreme Court has dealt with that particular problem overtly."
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.52,2706.289,But do you think there is any more or likely that the Supreme Court would grant a petition for habeas corpus filed in that court if the petitioner there can make allegations about what went on in the lower court?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2706.289,2716.042,I think that the likelihood of a hearing in the State Supreme Court would depend on the substantive claims more than anything else.
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.307,2733.084,What if you were representing an individual petitioning for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California after a denial in the Superior Court?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2745.543,2748.479,"In most cases, I think it would not."
1968.73,39,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.555,2765.301,Hold on Mr. Weber let's take a rather simple case.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2811.33,2825.863,"Well, there if the allegation was sufficient they would call for a rule to show cause and the state well, I suppose it responds, he did have counsel and you would say I suppose you would say --"
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.863,2835.106,Mr. Justice Marshall you might have the transcript and you could say or without the transcript you could say it was found in the contrary in lower court.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2835.106,2839.622,"Well, you could just get the records from Superior Court filed from the original trial."
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.622,2860.164,"What if you did what if you did get the record and you attached a part of the transcript to your return, so he did have counsel and here is what was found by the Superior Court."
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2860.164,2875.778,"Well, if the court would normally rely on the Superior Court's records unless they are disputed by the petitioner in some way, I suppose that if he says that the records are a lie that some sort of a hearing would be necessary to determine the accuracy of the records."
1968.73,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.778,2891.106,"So are you suggesting though then that hypothetical case, the Supreme Court might not deny on the basis -- deny the petition or deny a hearing on the basis of the hearing in the Superior Court?"
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2891.106,2898.828,I've never known the Supreme Court to expressly deny a hearing based on a hearing in the Superior Court.
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2913.347,2934.96,Mr. Weber suppose all of the facts stated in the petition in the Superior Court were true; would the Supreme Court -- would they be sufficient to grant a hearing in the Supreme Court.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2934.96,2935.81,In this particular case?
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2935.81,2937.202,In this particular case.
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2937.202,2976.458,"Well, this is an unusual situation, because between the time that the petition was presented in the Superior Court and the time that the Supreme Court received the substantive allegations, it came down with a major pronouncement in this area affecting inmate rights and that determination was against the petitioner, so that the legal situation had changed considerably and I think that the State Supreme Court could have utilized its very recent decisions to deny the petition without a hearing in this particular case."
1968.73,39,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2976.458,2990.427,So you take the position that even if all the allegations of the petition in the Superior Court were true that he would not be entitled to any relief?
1968.73,39,33521,jack_k_weber,,2990.427,2993.098,That's correct yes Your Honor.
1968.73,40,31944,justic_marshall,,2993.098,2995.772,Mr. Weber excuse me --
1968.73,41,33521,jack_k_weber,,2995.772,2997.133,Although of course we do dispute â€“
1968.73,41,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2997.133,2997.892,I beg your pardon?
1968.73,41,33521,jack_k_weber,,2997.892,2999.997,We do dispute the truth â€“
1968.73,41,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2999.997,3001.059,I can't hear you.
1968.73,41,33521,jack_k_weber,,3001.059,3006.397,We do dispute the truth of the allegations in the petition.
1968.73,42,31944,justic_marshall,,3006.397,3026.045,"If these are actual de novo hearings, independent hearings and in the interest of not wasting money, why take a transcript at all, why do you record it?"
1968.73,43,33521,jack_k_weber,,3026.045,3026.481,Well --
1968.73,44,31944,justic_marshall,,3026.481,3031.349,Except that if a person is wealthy enough he can pay for it.
1968.73,45,33521,jack_k_weber,,3031.349,3036.559,Of course if the writ is granted in Superior Court the state would have a right of appeal.
1968.73,46,31944,justic_marshall,,3040.04,3043.338,But that doesn't help the petition at all.
1968.73,47,33521,jack_k_weber,,3043.338,3056.5,"Well, some of these procedures help the state occasionally, again the transcript could be used by one party or the other on the--"
1968.73,48,31944,justic_marshall,,3056.5,3065.629,Does it add up to the transcript is really for the purpose of helping the wealthy petitioner and the state?
1968.73,49,33521,jack_k_weber,,3065.629,3066.538,"No, I don't think."
1968.73,50,31944,justic_marshall,,3066.538,3068.404,"Failure, that's all."
1968.73,51,33521,jack_k_weber,,3068.404,3070.241,I wouldn't agree with that.
1968.73,52,31944,justic_marshall,,3083.933,3085.942,We don't have the state here?
1968.73,53,33521,jack_k_weber,,3085.942,3086.315,Excuse me.
1968.73,54,31944,justic_marshall,,3086.315,3090.214,"We only have the state here, State of California."
1968.73,55,33521,jack_k_weber,,3090.214,3100.621,"Yes, but the Federal Courts have a power in determining state habeas corpus petitions to order the transcript of this particular evidentiary hearing."
1968.73,56,31944,justic_marshall,,3107.703,3109.012,Oh!
1968.73,57,33521,jack_k_weber,,3116.181,3120.089,Well we have forms provided for the petitioners and they --
1968.73,58,31944,justic_marshall,,3120.089,3130.409,Well I guess I'm taking it too far field but to me it looks like the benefit of the transcript is solely for the State and of course is able to pay for it.
1968.73,59,33521,jack_k_weber,,3131.8,3146.967,"No, Your Honor I think it goes a little beyond that and that our procedures are adequate to give meaningful habeas corpus to indigent prisoners as well as those who have some funds."
1968.73,59,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3153.668,3155.539,Mr. Rickershauser.
1968.73,60,19862,charles_e_rickershauser_jr,,3155.539,3158.093,I have nothing further Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.73,60,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3158.093,3160.447,Very well.
