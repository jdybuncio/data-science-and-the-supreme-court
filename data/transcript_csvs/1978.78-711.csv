1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.24,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 711, Southeastern Community College against Davis."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,10.388,12.83,Thank you.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.694,148.154,Well are you telling us that the hearing aid did not compensate fully or substantially for the handicap?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,148.154,157.51,"That is essentially the finding implicit in the District Court's opinion, yes."
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,174.73,179.005,"Mr. Gressman, she was a licensed practical nurse, was she not for some years?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,179.005,179.739,That is true.
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,181.664,190.963,And is there anything in the record which indicates that she was unable to perform those duties or that she did so with hazard to the patients?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,190.963,193.545,There is nothing in the record one way or the other on that.
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,202.49,204.173,Well that brings me to my next question.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,220.127,220.631,"Well, yes."
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,255.825,261.358,Are they fulfilled in actual practice? Does the record show that?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,261.358,263.605,You mean if they have lifted licenses --
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,263.605,267.09,Say that licenses have been terminated or revoked.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,267.09,268.958,"There's nothing in this record, no."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,404.57,413.573,"Mr. Gressman, you spoke of the nurse's activities in terms of a hospital."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,418.21,418.914,That is true.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.356,444.035,"Well, is there any statute giving a cause of action against an individual who would refuse to employ a nurse, a registered nurse on the grounds that the registered nurse had a handicap of this kind?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,444.035,444.607,Well --
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,444.607,447.304,Would that be discriminatory under any federal statute?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,447.304,465.354,"It could be discriminatory under 504 even in that employment relationship, if you decline to employ a qualified handicapped person solely because of his handicap."
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.354,467.629,Well if you're receiving a federal financial assistance.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,467.629,469.612,"Federal financial aid, that's right."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,470.81,483.645,"If an individual, I was addressing my question to an individual patient in a private home."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,483.645,484.185,You mean the individual --
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.185,501.816,"Any restriction or is it just -- does it violate any statute civil rights or otherwise for a person who is ill, or the family of that person who refused to hire a registered nurse on the ground that she's hard of hearing?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,501.816,516.135,I would assume not that that's no form of state action which any kind of a statute could reach as essential basis for imposing any kind of anti-discrimination policy.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,516.135,522.503,"But there are statutes about employments that do not involve state action, are there not?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,522.503,523.982,"Well, there are yes."
1978.78-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.287,591.896,"Mr. Gressman, does Section 504 apply to hospitals as well as schools if they receive federal --"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,591.896,596.23,"If it's a federally funded program of some sort, yes."
1978.78-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.994,618.404,Do you think the result of 504 and the valid regulations promulgated person to it would be to prevent a hospital from saying we will hire only registered nurses who have become registered under the North Carolina laws?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,618.404,639.657,"Well you have something of that problem, I understand, in the pending petition for certiorari in the (Inaudible) case where the -- a private hospital allegedly discriminated and refused to hire a handicapped nurse."
1978.78-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.83,670.421,But there's nothing in 504 that would in any way require North Carolina to alter its standards for licensing registered or licensed nurses?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,670.421,674.345,"Not in a bit, not in one -- in any way Your Honor."
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,730.873,733.081,"Mr. Gressman, could I ask you a question?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,751.063,751.738,That's right.
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,751.738,767.329,"And some of the findings are ambiguous but my interpretation of it was that they -- the District Court found that she could not progress satisfactorily with the training because when upon completion of the program, she could not safely perform her duties as a nurse."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,777.789,779.301,To complete the training program?
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,779.301,780.45,Yes.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,780.45,788.947,"Yes, she could not effectively complete the training program because of her handicap."
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.58,987.931,"Well, except that 504 is talking about not a qualified but an otherwise qualified, isn't it?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,987.931,992.91,That is true Your Honor and that is really the problem but in this case.
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.084,1029.095,"Well, one could read is as saying the person and indeed it's a natural reading that a person who is qualified except for his handicap shall not be excluded because of his handicap."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1032.111,1033.667,Nobody not with that --
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.667,1035.476,The blind bus driver and the moronic graduate student --
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1035.476,1036.726,That's right.
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1039.871,1040.477,Right.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1040.477,1048.819,"-- the literal reading of that language produces the impossible situation, and that is that you have to disregard all kinds of handicaps."
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.819,1049.529,Right.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1049.529,1058.539,And in terms -- and omit them to perform the most physically demanding jobs or activities known to man.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.083,1066.134,"Well to disqualify a person, it must be a job related handicap must it not?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1066.134,1067.218,Of course Your Honor.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1068.524,1078.018,This blind person might be -- would be obviously disqualified from being a bus driver or a taxi driver but not necessarily from being an elevator operator perhaps.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1078.018,1096.571,"That's true and I always like to think of the example of a law school who freely admits blind people, deaf people, paraplegics primarily because there is no physical qualification for entering into an academic type program of that nature."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1224.157,1235.76,"But there surely a person who is blind in a program that require a substantial amount of reading which I assume most academic programs do, or writing -- and/or writing, or listening."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1243.608,1253.576,That is exactly true and 504 regulations issued by HEW do require that certain kinds of auxiliary aids and assistance be given --
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1253.576,1256.417,Under this statute as so worded as --
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1256.417,1257.87,"Of the regulations under this statute, yes."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1257.87,1265.126,-- under this simple language of this statute as been found in a requirement for expenditure funds for a special --
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1265.126,1266.496,Not -- well this was --
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.496,1267.725,You mean?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1267.725,1287.538,"It's referred to in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit of the law here that on remand of this case, the court should give consideration to certain HEW regulations which required; one, auxiliary aids to be provided for the handicapped person, or two, to make modifications in the academic programs."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.538,1290.536,And those regulations have been promulgated under the authority of this statute?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1290.536,1291.334,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.023,1300.816,Certainly the statute itself gives no indication of a duty to undertake affirmative action?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1300.816,1308.556,"No, it does not Your Honor, and this is in direct contrast with the preceding two Sections, 501 and 503."
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.508,1336.894,But there are -- your are --
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1336.894,1338.748,Your Honor is exactly right.
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1346.797,1352.951,Do you challenge the validity of the regulations in so far as their promulgated pursuant to Section 504?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1352.951,1354.336,"Not at this point, Your Honor."
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1382.938,1389.262,"Mr. Gressman, was the Section 504 pleaded?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1389.262,1390.856,In the District Court?
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1390.856,1391.319,Yes.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1391.319,1394.549,"Yes, it was."
1978.78-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.969,1412.051,Was any reference -- was there ever actual reference to 504?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1412.051,1424.385,Well there is a -- it came in rather obliquely I believe in the --
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1424.385,1433.272,"I should ask you opposition this of course, but I take it you're not making any point, and you accept the presence of the 504 issue here."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1433.272,1434.208,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1453.386,1461.549,"Well Mr. Gressman, what's the effect of the reference to it in 15 (a) and the pretrial order?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1461.549,1468.321,"Well, I think that that was an elaboration clarification of her."
1978.78-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1476.666,1478.245,Well you're quite right if it came in at all.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1479.389,1480.124,Yes.
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1480.124,1484.006,"Mr. Gressman, are you going to address the implied cause of action point?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1484.006,1485.509,"Yes, I will Your Honor."
1978.78-711,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1485.509,1486.041,Your time is getting a bit short.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1486.041,1488.151,Right.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.198,1736.745,You're not leaving yourself much time for the implied cause of action.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1736.745,1749.559,"I would say as to the implied cause of action, Your Honor, that not only has it been fully briefed but I would emphasize what I think is the conclusive factor in that respect."
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.994,1865.227,"But Mr. Gressman, isn't it your case on that isn't any stronger than it would be under Title 6 is it?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1867.489,1870.129,I think the 1978 amendments do make a vital difference or distinction.
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.129,1877.49,"But absent though, your case is no stronger than it would be under Title 6 or 9, would it?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1877.49,1900.69,"No, except I think there may be some differences perhaps with respect to a spending program and with respect to the fact that you are dealing with an enormous regulatory system that has been developed in the HEW."
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.69,1902.401,Let me ask you this.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1909.914,1913.257,That's right.
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.257,1928.945,I suppose that even if there were not a private cause of action that would arose directly under Title 5 that you might be able to state a cause of action under 1983 relying on Title 5?
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1928.945,1930.221,You mean 504?
1978.78-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.221,1930.532,Oh yes.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1935.872,1967.436,Well I'm not aware Your Honor that this Court or any court has ever addressed this problem which I assume has been raised in the Solicitor General's brief here as to whether you can have a cause of action under 1983 premise upon a violation of another statute which gives no cause of action in and of itself.
1978.78-711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.032,2004.814,"-- Mr. Gressman if the other statute does give a cause of action, you don't need 1983, is that right?"
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,2004.814,2007.84,"Exactly right, exactly right."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.493,2037.511,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Gressman."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,2037.511,2039.361,Alright.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.065,2050.021,"Yes, that was a late filing."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,2050.021,2051.0,"That was, yes."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2051.0,2051.424,"Yes, you may respond."
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,2051.424,2055.069,I would like to file a very brief reply to that.
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.069,2057.264,You may do so as promptly as possible.
1978.78-711,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,2057.264,2058.382,"Yes, indeed."
1978.78-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2058.382,2064.59,Mr. Charmatz.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2064.59,2068.069,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.082,2162.433,Do we know what her physical condition was when she originally acquired her license in LPN?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2162.433,2164.712,I think we do Mr. Justice.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.374,2186.941,It seems to me then we don't.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2186.941,2187.079,Pardon.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.079,2188.467,It didn't say how many years.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2196.052,2208.632,"It has been assumed by the college that people with hearing impairments which can not be fully corrected, people with impairments similar or worst than Mrs. Davis' cannot function as a nurse."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2229.093,2234.125,"Nothing in this record to show the degree of impairment of this other 300, is there?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2234.125,2234.858,No.
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.582,2248.288,"If she can lip read, didn't it say that?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2248.288,2249.944,It said that she can.
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.944,2253.31,But she's only effective if she can lip read.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2253.31,2258.038,And she -- and her hearing aid improves her hearing.
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2258.038,2264.67,But she is efficient if she has hearing aid and she can lip read.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2264.67,2267.903,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.117,2276.876,"And how do you do that, through gauze, the -- that you wear in certain parts of the hospital, the gauze mask."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2278.411,2295.86,"Well, the Fourth Circuit in this case vacated and remanded the decision of the District Court to ask what accommodations could be made for Mrs. Davis, and what accommodations would be necessary in that --"
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.86,2297.872,You don't object to that.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2297.872,2298.7,We do not object to --
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.7,2299.321,Obviously.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2299.925,2301.14,No.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.14,2310.441,"But the vacation was not for purposes of seeing what accommodation could be made for in the operating room, but in the Southeastern Community College, wasn't it?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2310.441,2311.277,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.277,2316.32,And I heard by Mr. Justice Marshall's questions to go to her functioning in a hospital.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2316.32,2332.754,Well from the record we the statement of the nursing director at Southeastern Community Hospital who indicated that she did not know any area that Mrs. Davis couldn't function given her present determination to continue her education.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2346.856,2352.14,Could she under present North Carolina law be certified as a registered nurse?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2352.14,2357.885,We think that we might not have to reach that question but that the indication is that she could.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.885,2360.361,Didn't the District Court find against you on that point?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2360.361,2370.111,"No, I think the District Court found that the feelings of the college that she couldn't be a registered nurse were one of the reasons that the college refused her."
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.149,2446.711,"But when you say you have demonstrated something in amicus briefs, I thought the place you usually demonstrate something in a lawsuit is in the record before the trial court?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2446.711,2455.584,What I meant to say was that it is obvious that hearing-impaired people can perform in hospital situations.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.584,2455.699,Well --
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.699,2468.975,"Well if it's one thing to perform, even a deaf-mute might perform in the laboratory carrying out laboratory tests where there's no contact with patients."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2474.489,2486.241,"Well, the question is that Mrs. Davis has performed as a licensed practical nurse where she is in contact with patients."
1978.78-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2486.241,2488.651,What about the operating room?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2488.651,2491.286,The operating room?
1978.78-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2520.357,2522.892,Are you answering my question?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2546.321,2558.185,The question of whether or not she can perform in the operating room may be premature that we first have to see how she would perform in the clinical setting.
1978.78-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2564.45,2566.409,What do you mean by the clinical setting?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2570.443,2571.179,No.
1978.78-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2583.999,2590.893,"Well, is there any registered nurse program that does not take the candidates into the operating room?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2590.893,2591.839,Not that I know of.
1978.78-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2591.839,2592.752,No.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.752,2597.997,"Well then, isn't you are the plaintiff in this case, isn't the burden on you?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2604.962,2613.576,"The question is though, the problem was that the college refused to make any modification and that was their position."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2617.906,2622.346,But where in Section 504 is there imposed any duty to make any modifications?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2622.346,2624.369,In the statute doesn't say.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.369,2625.737,That's what I'm asking about the statute.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2625.737,2627.333,"In the statute, it does not say."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.333,2628.321,"Well, that's what --"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2628.321,2643.355,"In the legislative history to Section 504 in the same legislative history of the same Congress that enacted Section 504, the committee reports indicate that Section 504 is meant to have a requirement of affirmative relief."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.355,2645.638,"But there is no such requirement in the language of the statute, is there?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2645.638,2648.073,"In the language of the statute, no."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.109,2664.556,"But before we turn to the legislative history, we must be confronted with the statute that's ambiguous."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2669.707,2678.144,"We suggest that it is a broadly-worded statute that is similar to Title 6 and to Title 9, and in the --"
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.144,2680.67,Is it clearly worded?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2680.67,2698.629,"We think in terms of an otherwise qualified individual, it is one that HEW found required a number of different definitions, because of the different program activities."
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2754.957,2771.303,"Mr. Charmatz, on the question of the clinical program that Mr. Justice Blackmun was asking about, the District Court found that from the evidence presented at trial appears to be difficult and in fact dangerous for plaintiff to even attempt the clinical portion of the training program."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2773.775,2777.345,We think that the District Court asked the wrong questions.
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.58,2779.555,Do you challenge that finding?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2779.555,2783.845,We can't say that it's -- we do not allege that the findings are clearly erroneous.
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2795.928,2802.121,"Of course at the time of the District Court decision, was there a regulation that raised this question with the District Court?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2802.121,2807.428,The HEW regulation was promulgated in June of 1977.
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2813.265,2823.424,"So the District Court at that time didn't ask the wrong question what you are in effect arguing that later regulations raised a question that they should've anticipated, the District Court judge should've anticipated."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2823.424,2835.782,That and also that from the legislative history it seems that you should also consider accommodation questions which were not asked by the District Court.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.86,2995.667,Didn't the District Court find that LPNs perform their services only under the supervision of someone with superior medical training in the immediate supervision?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,2995.667,3000.908,I think that's correct that they do perform their training under the supervision of a registered nurse.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.49,3044.082,"Well could I ask, what do you think the Court of Appeals meant when it said “We vacate and remand that portion of the District Court judgment which has not been affirmed here and hold that the college must reconsider plaintiff's application for admission to the nursing program without regard to her hearing disability.”"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3044.082,3044.927,I think --
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.927,3049.015,Now that means that you put that aside entirely.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3049.015,3049.16,I think --
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.16,3052.516,And that isn't the way I understand your argument.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3052.516,3056.762,I think it means that you look at the academic standards first.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.762,3057.023,Yes.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3057.023,3062.295,And you see if the person meets the academic standards without regard to disability.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.295,3064.025,And then you look at the technical.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3064.025,3068.997,And then you look at the technical or actual program.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.177,3089.962,"Well, that isn't what this -- you don't suggest then that the Court of Appeals, if the Court of Appeals meant to say that if the -- if this person satisfies the academic and technical requirements, she is automatically admitted to the program."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3089.962,3090.654,No.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.654,3094.798,"Well that is -- if that's what the Court of Appeals meant, you think it was wrong?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3094.798,3097.003,Well I don't think the Court of Appeals meant that --
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.003,3102.362,"Well, unless one includes in technical requirements the physical requirements."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3102.362,3103.925,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.925,3106.176,"Well, what do you think it meant by technical?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3106.176,3109.287,I think it meant by technical work experience --
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.287,3113.291,"You don't think it meant hearing, it didn't?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3113.291,3113.69,No.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.69,3117.103,"No, it couldn't have or you would be out of court now."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3117.103,3117.66,That's right.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.66,3119.098,"Yes, exactly."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3119.098,3122.441,We think that that is the appropriate consideration.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.441,3132.242,"Well except the HEW regulations, I think you correct me if I'm mistaken, define technical as nonacademic, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3132.242,3132.91,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3132.91,3135.795,So that mean -- that would include physical wouldn't it?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3135.795,3142.002,"Well, we think that that should be construed in terms of the accommodation."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.822,3155.692,"Well it'd be helpful if -- I know you think it can be construed this, that way or the other, but if technical means everything except academic, it would include physical wouldn't it?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3155.692,3156.764,If it means everything?
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.515,3164.622,In which event the HEW construction would be right in your teeth.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3164.622,3172.574,"Except that when we look at the technical, we have to look to see if there can be accommodations."
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3172.574,3188.263,"Well, at least I gather you can see then that there wouldn't be automatic admission just because academic and requirements were satisfied, and the technical requirements as you understand were satisfied?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3188.263,3191.134,"Right, there would not be an automatic admission."
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.719,3205.059,Do you agree that HEW construes qualified in otherwise qualified to be exactly the same?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3205.059,3205.789,I think they do.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.376,3212.852,"Well isn't that -- that is not the way you read otherwise qualified, is it?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3212.852,3219.98,"Well, we read otherwise qualified or qualified handicapped person to be one that can perform the academic and technical standards."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3219.98,3222.716,"Despite his handicap, his or her handicap?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3222.716,3225.295,"Not despite his handicap, --"
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3225.295,3230.726,"Well, certainly the statute doesn't mean that he could do it except for his handicap, his or her handicap."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3231.022,3231.528,It doesn't.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3233.036,3233.678,No?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3233.678,3234.685,No.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3234.685,3236.339,So it must mean something else?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3236.339,3238.511,It may -- that does not mean the blind bus driver.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3238.511,3240.271,Right.
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3240.271,3248.918,"It means, if I understand you, that it's qualified to perform the technical requirements if the technical requirements were somewhat different?"
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3248.918,3249.702,I'm sorry?
1978.78-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3249.702,3255.834,It means that he has to be able to perform the technical aspects of the program if they were somewhat different than they are.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3258.9,3260.417,"I believe so, yes."
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.417,3267.039,"If the respondent had been totally deaf, just stone-deaf, would you make the same argument?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3267.039,3269.985,I think that we would.
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.985,3277.497,What level of handicap would cause you to conclude that 504 was inapplicable.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3277.497,3278.445,I think --
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.445,3284.838,"Suppose it was an individual who lost both hands, sight and capacity to hear?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3284.838,3290.34,Well the question -- the initial question would be whether or not he meets the academic requirements.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.01,3351.631,Well suppose it were concluded on remand that the -- this lady could not perform at all in the operating room that it would be just -- we're trying to see if there can be an accommodation between the demands of the operating room and being deaf to this degree.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3366.576,3367.771,I think we are.
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3369.867,3373.278,Even though a part of the training program is operating room procedures?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3373.278,3383.658,"I think we are -- I think that if that were the case, we would say that there are many opportunities available to handicapped citizens and as registered nurses, and they should be able to participate."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.741,3388.825,One of them being laboratory technicians for which she could qualify.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3388.825,3394.467,"That's correct, or the doctor's office or a private duty nursing or a number of other settings."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.467,3404.588,But isn't this program entitled to make the decision on the basis of adaptability for any one of these activities?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3404.588,3407.398,"Well, again I think that that's correct."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.512,3416.283,Well then I thought you conceded she was not adaptable for operating room performance?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3416.283,3418.691,I don't think we concede that point.
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3436.665,3438.88,How about my brother Rehnquist?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3452.098,3455.302,I think that you're not obliged to --
1978.78-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3455.302,3459.753,"Well, then go to my second point we are restricted to the record?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3459.753,3468.093,I think that since the District Court asked the wrong questions that the matter should be vacated or remanded.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.258,3496.274,"But you have the burden of proof, I mean it's up to you to persuade the District Court to ask the right questions and introduce the evidence that's necessary to support your claim under the law as it's properly applied."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3496.274,3513.724,"We have the burden of proof, but we -- but when the both the college and the District Court would not consider modifications there was for Mrs. Davis, the only efforts is what she did."
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.14,3533.546,"Mr. Charmatz, I'm still somewhat concerned about the posture of the district judge when he tried the case and what your contentions were there."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3547.833,3558.299,I think that the inquiry and testimony was whether or not with adequate supervision Mrs. Davis could perform the duties in the clinical program.
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.299,3560.885,Could complete the educational program offered by the college.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3560.885,3561.557,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.557,3565.427,And the District Court found that she could not because there would be dangerous situations.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3565.427,3567.23,But the District Court found --
1978.78-711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.23,3571.045,Asked the wrong questions but you didn't tell it to ask any other questions.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3572.736,3584.606,"But the District Court, again has said that as far as accommodations were concerned, even a supervision was concerned they weren't going to consider it."
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.145,3599.773,I take it the Court of Appeals thought the issue was properly in the case?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3599.773,3600.625,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3600.625,3602.837,At least you -- the way you read the Court of Appeals.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3604.945,3607.438,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3676.704,3683.609,"Well, where do you say the private right of action was originally created that was then not taken away?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3683.609,3687.088,Initially in the Senate Committee Report in 1974.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.088,3692.009,"Well, committee reports don't create causes of action, its laws though, isn't it?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3692.009,3692.74,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3692.74,3694.25,And where --
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3694.25,3705.28,But in so far as the indication of Congress that they considered that a private right of action was necessary to vindicate the rights of handicapped individuals --
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3705.28,3706.894,Some members of Congress --
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3706.894,3709.023,"Some members, yes."
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.023,3713.369,"Well, if it speaks through its statutes not through its reports."
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3713.369,3721.037,"But you concede that if there is a private right of action, as you contend there is, it is an implied one it's not an explicit one."
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3721.037,3722.173,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3722.173,3723.489,I know that you cite --
1978.78-711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3723.489,3725.661,Everybody agrees it's not explicitly in the statute.
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3725.661,3726.588,That's correct.
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3726.588,3740.194,"You cite Borak versus J.I. case in your brief, do you think that case is still good law, after Amtrak and Cort and Barbour?"
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3740.194,3754.023,"Well we think that for the purposes of this case, that for Section 504 that the private right of action can -- should be implied."
1978.78-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3754.023,3756.224,You don't feel you have to rely on Borak?
1978.78-711,1,35596,marc_p_charmatz,,3756.224,3760.701,No.
1978.78-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3761.374,3762.119,Thank you gentlemen.
