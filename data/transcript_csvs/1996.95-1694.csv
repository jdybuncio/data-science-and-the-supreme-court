1996.95-1694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.479,We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1694... the spectators are admonished not to talk until you get out of the courtroom.
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,41.68,44.862,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.391,193.424,"Mr. Miller, I want to make sure I understand one thing."
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,211.316,213.969,"Yes, Your Honor, with this one qualification."
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,223.714,224.135,Right.
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,224.135,228.148,"--for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and it would be looked at with its overall character."
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.76,261.56,"Well, are you assuming in the hypothetical that you raise, are you assuming in that case that the State treasury or ""State funds"" could never be reached, and that the only funds that could be reached would be those of the third party nongovernmental indemnitor?"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,261.56,266.586,"In fact, Your Honor, yes, and beyond that, that the entity was established on the premise--"
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,266.586,266.947,Okay.
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,266.947,269.688,--that its... the State funds would never be reached.
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,269.688,289.033,"So that... in other words, that doesn't really qualify, I take it, your answer, because your answer is, on the assumption that State funds are reachable at least in theory, the existence of a third party indemnitor is irrelevant as a matter of law to the Eleventh Amendment determination."
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,289.033,289.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.353,289.483,Okay.
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,289.483,289.814,That's the position.
1996.95-1694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.623,328.431,There was discussion in the Hess case of the potential for judgments to reach or not reach the State treasury.
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,334.405,336.297,"Two reasons, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.335,375.764,So you're saying that the discussion there simply was a way for us to inquire or measure the connection between the bi-State entity and the State?
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,375.764,377.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,384.441,417.443,"Mr. Miller, was an antecedent to getting to that in the Hess case that we were dealing with an entity that had not simply two States as creators, but the Federal Government as well, and then said, there is a presumption that such an entity founded by three sovereigns does not wear the mantle of a State, and maybe that presumption is undone if the States are legally obligated to pick up the tab for it, but--"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,417.443,419.395,"--That is absolutely right, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.46,483.538,"--But in any event, here there is no legal... there's no release of the university from legal liability."
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,488.062,508.267,"That's unquestionably true, Your Honor, and were a judgment to be entered on this breach of contract case, claim against the university, the university would be legally liable, and all of the consequences that would flow from having had a court make a legal determination of a violation of someone's rights would apply in the case."
1996.95-1694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.839,540.047,"In these cases involving universities, is it important for us to inquire whether, as a matter of State law, there is sovereign immunity that attaches to the institution, or is it not important, because sovereign immunity can always be waived?"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,540.047,556.058,"I think it's an element, Your Honor, of the inquiry, the ultimate inquiry which this Court announced in the Mount Healthy case, and I think it's been repeated again in the Hess case and others, was what is the intention of the State in establishing the entity?"
1996.95-1694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.93,602.881,"Do those statutes, do you think, supersede the California supreme court's decision, the 1899 decision where they... in the Royer case where the California supreme court said that the university, while a governmental institution, is not clothed with the sovereignty of the State and it's not a sovereign?"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,606.894,609.406,I think that sentence has to be read for precisely what it said.
1996.95-1694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.432,645.361,"--Haven't we held in one of our decisions that even though the State may... State law may say it's... an entity is suable in State court, that does not conclude the Eleventh Amendment inquiry in Federal court?"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,645.361,646.052,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.502,675.614,"What about the converse proposition, not waiver, but could a State... let's take a cement plant as an example... go into the cement business and create the cement administration entity as an arm of the State and say it shall not be immune... it shall be immune from all suit in Federal court and also in State court?"
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,675.614,675.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.445,694.46,Is there any Federal limit on the extent to which a State can create subdivisions that will be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity?
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,694.46,715.854,"I don't think there are any Federal limits, Your Honor, because the whole point here of the Eleventh Amendment is to respect State sovereignty and the State's decision as to how to organize itself to carry out its governmental functions, and if the State decides hypothetically that the... operating a cement plant is a sovereign function it wants to undertake, that decision should be respected."
1996.95-1694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.854,718.288,"Well, it is not respected in international law any more."
1996.95-1694,0,19579,charles_a_miller,,735.501,736.853,It's not involved in this case but I'm happy to--
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,962.055,980.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.363,1082.476,You say binding?
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1086.758,1087.379,--Yes.
1996.95-1694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.865,1109.624,"Ms. Blatt, you mentioned with respect to the Department of Energy's... what it assumes, what liabilities it will assume, that that is now undergoing revision."
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1114.737,1121.413,"--The final rule has not been issued yet, but the Department of Energy hopes to have it out in the near future."
1996.95-1694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1127.536,1135.32,What would be the principal change from the indemnity as it now exists and as it will exist if this rulemaking is final?
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1135.32,1140.314,There's a very significant change in the third party liability clause.
1996.95-1694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1186.639,1188.592,Thank you.
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1197.455,1220.712,"No, other than to assume that they are, based on the way the question presented is worded, that if they're otherwise immune, then as a State entity the Department of Energy's contractual obligation to indemnify them doesn't change anything because it is the university who is subject to the coercive enforcement powers of the court and in any event may turn around to the Department of Energy and the Department may not pay."
1996.95-1694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1220.712,1227.885,"Ms. Blatt, that was the way the question presented was worded, but the Ninth Circuit decision was more diffuse, wasn't it?"
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1253.183,1280.622,"I think it's a fair characterization of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that what distinguished the university in this situation was the court of appeals view of the Department of Energy's contractual obligations, and our position is not to dispute any of the factors the Ninth Circuit looked at except for what they relied on, this payment factor that an indemnity allegation is solely a matter between the university and the Department of Energy."
1996.95-1694,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.675,1302.444,"And you take the position also, I understand, that in making the determination of the university's status for Eleventh Amendment purposes that the existence of an indemnification agreement as such is simply an irrelevant consideration."
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1302.444,1319.447,"That's correct, and you have here what certainly we did not dispute, was that the State of California is legally obligated to satisfy the university's debts based on both the Constitution and the fact it appropriates significant amounts of money to the university each year."
1996.95-1694,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1319.447,1322.471,"Given that fact, that's where you stop, on your view."
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1322.471,1322.729,Yes.
1996.95-1694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.855,1395.787,"I don't believe my colleagues do, either."
1996.95-1694,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1395.787,1396.599,--Okay.
1996.95-1694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.788,1399.29,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1402.192,1409.957,Mr. Chief Justice... excuse me... and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.907,1456.493,"But I didn't think we had taken this case to go into whether, absent the indemnification provision, there is sovereign immunity or not."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1484.091,1491.828,"Focusing on that narrow issue, which I personally believe that the broader issue is subsumed within the question presented--"
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.828,1492.308,"Well, let's read--"
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1492.308,1492.869,--Focusing on the--
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.869,1494.091,--Let's read the question presented.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1494.531,1498.075,"--Well, I agree with Your Honor's statement of the question presented so--"
1996.95-1694,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.075,1498.275,--Well--
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1498.275,1499.377,--I'd like to focus on that.
1996.95-1694,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.424,1528.231,"--Well, if the university is just a facade, Mr. Gayer, perhaps you should sue only the Federal Government, not the university."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1528.231,1557.99,"The problem is we have no jurisdiction in the Federal District Court over the Department of Energy until... ever, and we don't have any jurisdiction in the Federal District Court over the Department of Energy until and unless such time as the plaintiff in this case gets a judgment against the name of the university, so step one is to sue the university here in U.S. district court and get a judgment."
1996.95-1694,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.604,1566.027,"But the university says the court has no jurisdiction over it either, because of the Eleventh Amendment."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1566.027,1572.752,"--Obviously, we contend that the university is wrong, because there can be no impact on the State treasury."
1996.95-1694,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1573.902,1578.715,"Well, what if the university just had a big insurance policy to cover any liability."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1579.576,1581.827,--Different answer.
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.615,1595.219,They paid for the Government's indemnification promise as well.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1598.371,1598.932,"Yes, it is."
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.932,1609.821,"The contract would... you know, the university would have demanded a lot more money for the contract if that indemnification provision weren't in it, so the payment isn't the difference between the two."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1609.821,1615.952,"Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree, because here the university is doing this as a public service."
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.972,1638.699,Do you deny that they would have demanded much more reimbursement from the Federal Government if they did not have the Federal Government's indemnification guarantee?
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1638.699,1640.77,"Well, this calls for my--"
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.77,1645.445,"If they had to be either self-insurers, or had to buy insurance from an insurance company?"
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1645.445,1648.834,"--Well, we can only... Your Honor, we can only speculate on that."
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.834,1649.045,I know.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1650.247,1650.918,I would speculate that the--
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.304,1662.477,Because the cost is too high.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1662.477,1663.819,There's too much risk.
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.111,1695.782,"Aside from the fact that the university would pay for a private insurance policy, is there any other feature that would distinguish Justice O'Connor's question from the case before us?"
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1695.782,1709.369,"Thank you, Justice Scalia, yes, there's an important distinction here, I think, that in general an indemnitor such as an insurance company is quite separate from the contract, say, between the Government and the Regents corporation."
1996.95-1694,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.845,1733.388,I thought they didn't pay just any judgment no matter what.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1740.234,1741.796,"--Well, that's true."
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1906.668,1919.927,"Mr. Gayer, I'd like to know how far your position about a State university goes with respect to insulating the State against any monetary liability for that piece of the university."
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1965.778,1968.291,"--Well, it depends on how the entity is structured."
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1983.392,1990.868,It's just that the State budget is never going to be touched because this is such a profitable department that it pays all its own bills.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,1990.868,2002.996,"Oh, I think that's what happened in Hess, that initially the bi-State entity was receiving something like $100,000 a year from each State, but that was years and years ago and--"
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.996,2004.946,It was not an entity of any single State.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2006.899,2010.592,--But according to the dissent in Hess the same test applies.
1996.95-1694,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.592,2010.952,"But, Mr.--"
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2013.476,2015.699,I stand squarely with the entire decision in Hess.
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.699,2016.53,But it is--
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2016.53,2016.8,I'm trying to harmonize--
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.8,2019.573,--You must admit it's rather peculiar to do what you did in your brief.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2026.498,2027.93,"--No, I'm trying to harmonize--"
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.93,2028.17,It is rather unusual.
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2028.17,2035.646,--Because we... in our proposed test the first thing you look at is the impact on the S-t-a-t-e treasury.
1996.95-1694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2035.646,2043.002,"You don't agree that, in general, to find out what the majority opinion says one looks to the majority opinion rather than the dissent?"
1996.95-1694,2,39397,richard_gayer,,2043.002,2044.684,"It sounds like a good idea, Your Honor."
