1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-391, Arthur Calderon v. Troy Ashmus."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,22.461,24.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.397,59.967,"Mr. Matthias, do you think this suit could have been brought as a class action in a State court in California?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,59.967,64.12,As a declaratory judgment?
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.12,64.736,Yes.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,64.736,72.477,"There is a... Your Honor, there is a provision of California law for declaratory judgments."
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.429,80.131,"Well, I'm just wondering what the alternatives might have been."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,92.205,106.298,"Well, I'm not sure that the State courts would have thought themselves to be an appropriate forum for entertaining the question insofar as the issue of 154 compliance or not only has significance for--"
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.298,109.416,"Well, a State court can decide that just as well as a Federal court, couldn't it?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,109.416,123.741,"--Certainly I'm convinced that a State court could read the Federal statute, interpret it, and would be actually in a better position to understand the issue at least insofar as the 154 compliance question--"
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.741,134.116,"Well, as a practical matter it makes a lot of sense to have the whole issue resolved and not do it case-by-case in every separate Federal habeas petition that's filed."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,139.202,140.636,--It does make some sense.
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.526,178.026,"Not just the subissues, the whole thing."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,178.026,180.811,"--That, too, might have been available."
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.811,190.166,"Did... has California complied... by the way, has California adopted a statute in the interim, since we took this--"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,190.166,190.582,Yes.
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.993,240.313,"--Now, you're arguing, Mr. Matthias, that the Eleventh Amendment bars this proceeding."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,245.967,246.451,No.
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.103,256.156,"And so you're arguing this is not an appropriate ex parte Young situation, I guess."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,256.156,256.672,Precisely.
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.672,261.642,And who were the State officials who were joined?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,261.642,263.845,It's two wardens.
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.547,273.884,Were the wardens going around making contentions about what California had done by way of providing counsel?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,273.884,279.022,To my knowledge the wardens had never breathed a word on the subject of 154--
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.022,283.24,Was there an allegation in the complaint that the wardens had made these contentions?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,283.24,284.926,--No.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.524,339.143,"And he's a defendant, the Attorney General's a defendant?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,339.143,339.526,--Yes.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.092,392.695,"Are you suggesting by what you just said that California's position really is kind of iffy, non-final on this matter of whether the State complies with 154, because I thought that the lawsuit was premised on the idea that California has said yes, we make it, we fit under 154, but now you seem to be saying something that would... doesn't even get us to something fancy like the Eleventh Amendment, that California really hasn't taken a firm position."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,392.695,396.265,"Well, California officials certainly spoke to the issue publicly."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.24,415.643,"Well, what is California's position right now, yes we fit, or maybe we fit, we hope we fit?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,415.643,417.109,"--No, it's not maybe."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.986,432.503,So now you're backing off from what you said before.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,441.009,443.211,"--Your Honor, I didn't say he was under pressure."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.379,459.772,"--But now you say, forget all that, yes we have crossed swords here, we are saying we've made a final decision, we comply, is that--"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,459.772,461.372,"--We believe we have complied, and I think--"
1997.97-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.372,464.89,"--You say you've complied, but you didn't say you had complied earlier."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,473.913,474.848,--That's correct.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.621,486.073,So when did you join issue on this point?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,486.073,493.31,During the litigation I think it became clear that the plaintiffs had correctly anticipated our position.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.63,507.819,"So a plaintiff is predicting what a defense would be, and then the defendant says, yes, that's our defense, and that's the basis for a lawsuit?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,507.819,510.938,--That appears to be the basis for this lawsuit.
1997.97-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.371,571.993,"It's to be applied by Federal courts, which is why I'm not sure that there could have been a declaratory judgment in State court."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,581.065,581.45,"--No, I--"
1997.97-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.45,583.217,--courts would give that kind of a declaratory judgment.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,583.217,597.56,"--I don't think it would be that, Your Honor, but I think... and the reason I responded affirmatively to Justice O'Connor's question is, I thought we both understood, and it's true that there are State law subquestions lurking in the AEDPA."
1997.97-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.65,615.006,"But unless California has a very unusual declaratory judgment procedure, you usually declare the existence of nonexistence of a certain right."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,626.729,633.05,"I quite agree, although there's another relevant change in the law, a very recent development that speaks to this precise question."
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.893,726.345,Can... I see that.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,730.964,732.166,"Surely, Your Honor."
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.616,737.218,What in your opinion is the right route?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,794.823,799.893,"There are many, and they all arise in the context of the habeas corpus proceeding itself."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,830.079,842.72,"But there's a problem with that, because he has to file the petition in order to see the judge, and I thought that the problem was how much time does he have to file the petition."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,846.339,851.326,"Your Honor, I'm speaking to a point in time that typically precedes the actual filing of a petition by years."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.81,882.345,But is the applicant going to... is he going to know any particular judge at that point?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,882.345,883.178,Yes.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.178,883.561,He would be dealing with a--
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,883.561,900.557,"The procedure in the Northern District and all the districts of California is that the request for appointment of counsel gets docketed, it gets a number, it gets the initials, it goes to a court, and that judge almost invariably that day enters the stay, signs the order, and the search for a lawyer begins."
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.028,946.585,"--So does the death row prisoner argue, I want the stay, and I'm entitled to a stay only if California has not complied with these legal requirements?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,946.585,947.051,No.
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.12,954.624,He's entitled to a stay only if your position on the merits is wrong.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,954.624,955.024,--No.
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,956.309,957.143,Only if it's right.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,957.143,957.843,--No.
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.047,965.415,"I'm saying, how does he get to raise his claim?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,965.415,968.701,--He raises that claim by identifying the provision of law under which--
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.701,970.517,"Well, he said the judge would say it doesn't matter."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,970.517,971.819,--The judge could say that.
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.819,972.153,All right.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,996.351,1006.659,"The answer is no other action, but numerous other courses of conduct, numerous other avenues of recourse."
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.942,1008.292,Let's get one.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1008.592,1009.278,--One would be--
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.278,1010.378,--because the first one I'm not too happy with.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1010.378,1019.467,"--One would be asking for a stay, and having the court decide whether or not the stay is pursuant to 2262, which does not apply unless Chapter 154 applies."
1997.97-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.467,1020.184,Okay.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1021.169,1040.463,"He could ask... he could ask the court for guidance on that, and the judge would have to provide it, because the judge is required to determine whether Chapter 154 applies or not, because if it does, the judge is statutorily obligated to give that matter priority, so the Federal district judge must concern himself with this question."
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.463,1049.903,Is it essential to your case to show that there was some other way for these people to get an advanced declaration of what their rights were?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1064.496,1065.864,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.663,1103.721,"A lot of the questions from the bench up to now, and the... your argument have been devoted to the second question presented, is this a proper injunction, but you also contend it's a violation of the Eleventh Amendment."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1106.941,1116.297,"Ex parte Young was developed, which was the doctrine that was ultimately invoked by the Ninth Circuit in support of this cause of action, of this proceeding."
1997.97-391,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1222.046,1223.498,"Well, you're right on that."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1366.625,1368.06,It is not here.
1997.97-391,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.912,1404.733,"Well, what if the judge says, look, I'm not here giving you advisory opinions."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1412.172,1414.456,The judge must concern himself with that question.
1997.97-391,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1418.658,1421.193,Tell me... that's the point that I think I'm not getting.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1424.145,1427.263,--Because it's a different provision of law that will authorize--
1997.97-391,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.263,1431.882,"Yes, but as Justice Breyer said, he says, look, I'll appoint him under this section or that section."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1436.535,1451.478,"--I think the judge would more than likely want to inform himself not only what is the authority for the stay, and I realize it could be one of two places, he would also need to inform himself whether the entire proceeding is one which he will be statutorily required to--"
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.478,1474.042,"But wouldn't it be premature for the... I mean, the one thing he has to do, whether it's 153 or 154, is appoint a lawyer, and you said this could happen years before the actual petition is filed, so why would a judge want to make a determination at that threshold state that might well be different down the road when the petition is actually filed?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1478.945,1480.397,--It won't change.
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.657,1500.193,--You say... but when is getting into Federal court?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1505.763,1511.251,"--Well, you get into Federal court under McFarland for the purpose of asking for a lawyer and getting a stay."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.251,1515.655,"Yes, but not for the purpose of making a determination whether it's 153 or 154."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1515.655,1529.712,"Well, that may not be the purpose, but that's the effect, because if the judge grants the stay, the judge must concern himself with his statutory authority for entering such a stay, and the source of that authority will differ, depending on whether it's 153 or 154."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.58,1544.738,"But it... for the purpose of what the judge is doing at the moment, does it make any difference... does it have anything to do with what counsel he can appoint, how much that counsel will be paid, whether at that point he says 153 or 154?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1544.738,1553.261,"--It does, because the judge will have read the statute and will understand that the minute that petition is filed he's obligated to treat it with priority over all other noncapital matters."
1997.97-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.135,1570.372,"Well, if that was all so clear, why didn't the district judge and the Ninth Circuit just tell us that?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1580.145,1591.636,--I can't tell you why the Ninth Circuit did not take stock of the fact that there are many mechanisms for determining that short of a separate lawsuit.
1997.97-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.636,1592.203,What's another one?
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1593.488,1595.357,You could simply file a motion.
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.638,1631.613,"But ordinarily, you know, if you're going to get a ruling from a district court you ordinarily would have one party actually present, the other party present."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1640.718,1653.776,"Well, that's right, except Mr. Ashmus knows very well that it's entirely possible to go to your Federal district court judge with questions, uncertainties that you have about the application of AEDPA, and you get lickety-split answers."
1997.97-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.776,1666.953,"Yes, but may I just go... you never completed your answer to Justice Breyer as far as I was concerned, because you gave the example if he thinks 134 applies, or 154 applies then he'll act pursuant to 2262, grant the stay, and so forth."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1679.094,1679.66,No.
1997.97-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.545,1690.401,"But then what happens if the judge thinks, well, I'll follow 153, when he comes in and asks for a lawyer and a stay?"
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1690.401,1701.274,"Then he gets the benefit, the inmate knows that he will not be held to 154, we express our objections, and that will become an issue that will be reviewed in due course."
1997.97-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.274,1702.876,And--
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1709.113,1710.296,"Well, it may still turn out--"
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.296,1712.232,"I mean, you just backed yourself into it."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1731.793,1733.645,--We are enormously interested--
1997.97-391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1733.645,1746.453,Which is why I asked you in the first place whether they couldn't go into State court and determine whether there are State laws that establish what is required for a unitary proceeding.
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1746.453,1750.571,"--Your Honor, I assure you the State is enormously interested in attaining resolution of this question."
1997.97-391,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1758.011,1764.747,"Well, let me ask you, suppose you had conferred in the Office of the Attorney General and you said, you know, this suit is a vehicle for us to get a quick answer."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1775.972,1782.309,"It certainly would have been... it would have made enormous sense to insist up on no injunction, because that's preposterous and unprecedented."
1997.97-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.309,1790.898,"Well, but then what good would the class action have done without the injunction, because then these petitioners would be in the same position as if they hadn't filed a class action at all."
1997.97-391,0,39853,ronald_s_matthias,,1798.819,1815.597,"My only response to that is, I... to the extent that there is an insoluble dilemma created by the AEDPA, and I don't believe it's at all insoluble, but to the extent it is troubling and the stakes are indisputably high, that is a function of the AEDPA itself, not what State officials say about the AEDPA."
1997.97-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.597,1816.98,"Thank you, Mr. Matthias."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,1818.765,1830.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.817,1851.853,What's the difference between unlawfully and illegally?
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,1851.853,1867.196,"The unlawfully aspect of this case is that Ex parte Young doesn't focus merely on whether the State's actions are illegal, but rather whether or not the State's actions interfere with a cognizable Federal right, and that is precisely what--"
1997.97-391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.196,1869.481,"Well, that's not really right."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,1919.414,1928.603,--The question of whether or not California's entitled to the benefits of Chapter 154 is one that Congress determined by the presence of a statute.
1997.97-391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.138,1937.708,"No, the State does not have to try to opt in to unitary review."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,1940.494,1942.394,--That's absolutely correct.
1997.97-391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.943,1988.725,"But your injunction that you obtained in the district court prohibits the State from taking the position that 154 applies, and the State says, it seems to me with considerable justification, that there is nothing illegal about our arguing the position, and you have therefore taken away one of the principal threshold primary tests for Ex parte Young."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,1991.76,2010.721,What the district court found as a matter of fact as well as a matter of law is that the effect of the threats that the State of California would invoke Chapter 154 in future habeas proceedings was that petitioners were forced to comply with 154 in... without regard to the law.
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.721,2017.077,"But that has nothing to do with the State's position, the State violating the law."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2041.61,2046.864,What the district court found was that Chapter 154 does not apply in California.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2073.164,2098.962,"But Mr. Laurence, I take it from what you said about the declaratory judgment that nothing really turns on California's bragging or... that the defendants on death row would be in precisely the same position if the California Attorney General didn't speak one word, as long as there was a realistic suspicion that California might take this position."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2132.369,2142.908,"That is absolutely correct, that whether or not you're entitled to a declaratory judgment does not turn on whether or not the State officials have already asserted compliance with Chapter 154."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.908,2155.299,"So you're saying every death row inmate in every State in the country could come in and say, district court, give us the assurance that when we file our petition it will be under 153 and not 154."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2160.001,2163.905,I think there are two limiting principles here that would prevent that kind of result.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2176.462,2179.581,But I'm not even getting up to Ex parte Young.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2226.895,2239.886,"That goes to the second limiting principle that I think is present in this case, and let me first say that standing, ripeness, and cause of action were all litigated below, and the State has waived any consideration by this Court of those issues."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.886,2244.857,"Oh, you cannot waive the presence of an actual case or controversy within Article III."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2246.074,2246.642,Absolutely not.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.642,2248.308,We're obliged to raise that on our own.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2281.546,2293.671,"And I agree, Your Honor, and to clarify my earlier remarks, the cause of action argument was the one that was expressly raised by the petitioners in the reply brief, but--"
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.671,2295.123,"Well, that's a 12(b)(6) question."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2295.589,2296.056,--That's correct.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.056,2297.408,--way short of that.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2310.798,2327.51,"If we fulfill the requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which is a discretionary jurisdiction but is limited to specific circumstances where the rights and responsibilities of the parties must be decided before there's irreparable injury, then I believe we are properly before this Court."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.51,2330.712,"Well, the declaratory judgment is a remedy."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2333.831,2343.187,"That's correct, and under section 1331 there's no question that this Court has jurisdiction because this dispute arose from a Federal statute."
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.274,2377.027,"Do you know any other instance in which someone has gotten a declaratory judgment on just an abstract issue of law, whether 153 or 154 applies, as opposed to whether I am entitled to occupy this property, or whether, you know, a particular right... this is no adjudication of any right of your clients at all, whether they're entitled to get out of prison, whether they're... you know, it's just a declaratory judgment for a declaration about an abstract proposition of law."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2379.027,2380.979,It's not an abstract--
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.979,2381.979,I thought you had to have a cause of action.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2386.281,2391.935,--And the claim of right I believe stems from Chapter 153 and 154.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.6,2393.036,--not claim of right.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2402.892,2416.133,"--Congress I believe established that these two procedures cannot coexist, that habeas petitioners, by default, as this Court recognized in Lindh v. Murphy, are entitled to the benefits of Chapter 153."
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.421,2468.501,"Well, Mr. Laurence, supposing in a somewhat different context you have a claim that you want to bring under 1983, some sort of a civil rights claim, but you're not ready to bring the claim yet, and you're worried which statute of limitations, which State statute of limitations will the Federal court apply to your case."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2474.904,2477.956,I believe in most circumstances the answer is no.
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2477.956,2480.058,Why should it be different here?
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2480.058,2491.05,A statute of limitations that does not depend upon an assertion of a defense by a State officer does not involve the same kind of problems that were recognized in Ex parte Young.
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.05,2494.985,"Yes, but the problems are... certainly that doesn't make it any easier for you."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2496.187,2515.315,"I'm sorry, it does make it more difficult to understand what the law is, but Congress has not established these two independent statute of limitations depending on what the State officials do after you have filed in excess of the time permitted by one of those statute of limitations."
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.315,2525.873,"Mr. Laurence, is it clear that the application of the statute of limitations depends, as you say, upon the assertion of a defense by the State?"
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2536.829,2538.431,Absolutely not.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.431,2546.786,"And say, because California wants to do it the old way, and they like these lengthy procedures, we're going to subject the Federal court to these lengthy procedures?"
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2549.904,2555.123,"It makes a difference in that they can only apply if the State qualifies, that's correct."
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.123,2559.344,"If the State qualifies, not if the State asserts that it qualifies."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2559.344,2568.283,I don't believe that any court has held that we are going to apply Chapter 154 despite the fact the State has not demonstrated--
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.283,2576.139,"Well, I'll be darned if I'm going to let a State make the Federal process more cumbersome than Congress has said just because it chooses to."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2578.406,2580.591,--I respectfully disagree.
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.337,2605.991,"I... we know the substantive part, but I'm having the same problem."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2678.604,2698.585,"I think the case most on point is this court's decision in Steffel v. Thompson, in which this Court said a threat for future proceedings brought by State officers which interferes with a person's Federal rights is a proper... proper forum to bring it within a declaratory judgment act."
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.585,2704.655,But there the people had been arrested and the threat was to continue the arrests.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2708.274,2713.76,"If I remember the facts correctly, the two people who brought the lawsuit originally had not been arrested."
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.76,2717.831,"But there was... they proved a continuing threat of arrest, did they not?"
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2717.831,2720.95,The continuing threat was the threat to take action.
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2722.05,2723.818,"Well, to take action of arresting them."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2723.818,2748.934,"But this Court hasn't distinguished between arresting or threatening some other type of proceeding for the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, and in fact the State's position in this case before the district court was that, despite the fact that a Declaratory Judgment Act... declaratory judgment would be entered, they planned and were wishing to seek a divergent opinion in the very next courtroom."
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.052,2773.733,"But if... cases like Great Lakes v. Huffman and others say that you have to comply with virtually the same requirements to get a declaratory judgment that you have to comply with to get an injunction, so it's not as if you can avoid the principles of injunctive law on the merits by saying all I want is a declaratory judgment."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2775.285,2797.533,"You certainly have to make a showing that there's an actual case or controversy as well as the particular requirements of standing, Federal jurisdiction, and everything else, but the State here has conceded that a declaratory judgment was proper in the district court if it had been made in a habeas proceeding in behalf of an individual petitioner."
1997.97-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.533,2801.835,"Well, that wouldn't be so much of a declaratory judgment."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2815.662,2826.684,"Well, in the district court they did, Your Honor, and I refer to the proceedings that were conducted on May 6, 1996, where they actually... I'm... pardon me."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2842.561,2850.917,"I don't understand that point, because it seems to me if they bring it, say, after 180 days the judge makes a ruling of law in that case."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2873.747,2890.126,"It certainly doesn't have the label of a declaratory judgment, necessarily, but when we were discussing the alternatives in the district court and the Ninth Circuit the State took the position that you would get the same declaratory judgment in Mr. Ashmus' habeas proceeding."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2899.732,2914.158,"But the problem is... you gave us Steffel v. Thompson, where I suppose the defendant... the petitioner is trying to ward off the State instituting criminal proceedings against him."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2914.658,2925.982,"--The person actually wanted to handbill at a mall and was threatened with arrest for loitering, for distributing the handbills."
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.982,2926.465,Right.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,2961.722,2965.59,Maybe it would be helpful if I bring it to actually one individual case.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.206,2998.597,But that's true... what you're saying now is true of every person in every State that might say 154 applies.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3005.001,3008.453,Where they have to make some decision about how to proceed.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3008.453,3025.063,"Where they... whether the State has said anything as long as there is any genuine concern that the State might attempt to qualify, that person is going to be facing the kind of dilemma that you're bringing to our attention."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3067.492,3072.044,I would think they would have to show some actual case or controversy.
1997.97-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.548,3077.748,Right.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3077.748,3097.361,"But I would think that those kinds of situations likely are going to be resolved either by this, resorting to this mechanism, or by individuals in cases such as Maryland, which has only six people on death row at the time they filed their complaint, in any individual case."
1997.97-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3097.361,3118.275,"Mr. Laurence, getting down to one of the themes that we have here, which is what's different about the claim that you're making from the claim of any litigant who says, I'm not quite sure when to sue, so I'd like to bring a preliminary threshold action to litigate the possibility of affirmative defense of the statute of limitations--"
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3118.275,3119.725,I think that--
1997.97-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3119.725,3122.976,--What is at stake here that's not at stake there?
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3145.508,3158.066,"--You do if you're uncertain as to the law and you don't know, for example, in Mr. Ray's case what he should have done on May 6, his options are this:"
1997.97-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.198,3188.685,"So you're saying if one or the other applies, he better get his petition for counsel in fast."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3188.685,3190.402,--He has to make some decisions.
1997.97-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3190.402,3190.885,All right.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3203.961,3222.156,"I think the Congress has set up this statutory scheme where it intends one of the two circumstances to apply, and those circumstances involve the risk that people will be executed because they have made the wrong choice."
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.156,3226.643,What about his suggestion that you could structure this differently?
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3257.912,3261.983,It is possible for the 110 individuals who are in Federal court--
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3261.983,3263.733,"I mean, you couldn't get a class, but you could get a test case."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3263.733,3270.053,--But the test case would not have been resolved until after the running of that 6 months.
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3270.053,3275.874,Everybody would have to file the protective and ask for the stay.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3278.159,3278.609,Absolutely.
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.609,3291.316,"And everybody would have to file within the 180 days, immediately move for a stay, so he can bring it a year later, and the issue of whether that stay is proper or not proper would turn on exactly what you want to raise."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3291.316,3308.928,"And that would have been a remedy for the 50 or so individuals in Federal court at the time we brought this lawsuit who hadn't filed petitions yet, but our class contains 300 members who were not in Federal court or who were in Federal court without counsel."
1997.97-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.987,3349.605,But isn't it also true that it's not just a stay.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3359.73,3373.204,"That's absolutely correct, because if you file your petition and you're governed by Chapter 153, the normal rules of amendments apply, but if you're... if you file a petition and you're governed by Chapter 154, you cannot--"
1997.97-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.204,3374.004,Amend it--
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3374.004,3377.524,--except under exceptional circumstances amend that petition.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.432,3401.807,"--Well, we have certain rules, too, you know, as to when various pleadings have to be filed, as well as statutory rules about, you know, how long after the judgment in the court of appeals you can seek certiorari."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3432.426,3433.861,I don't believe so.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.395,3434.811,Why not?
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3434.811,3441.532,--I don't believe that the rules governing when you must file the cert petition depend upon the actions of the other party.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.967,3445.919,"Oh, it doesn't depend on the... oh, I see."
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3449.704,3450.27,Absolutely.
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.27,3456.976,Not on whether the State has... is taking the position that they satisfy the statute.
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3457.843,3459.676,"Exactly, and the other option that the habeas--"
1997.97-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.676,3459.843,That is--
1997.97-391,1,36184,michael_laurence,,3459.843,3479.672,"--petitioners had is that they could have waited until their petitions were finally complete, filing them 6, 7, 8, 9 months after their direct appeal was concluded, and risk having the State come in and say, I'm sorry, you will be executed because you failed to comply with the 6-month statute of limitations."
