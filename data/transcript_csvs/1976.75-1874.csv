1976.75-1874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,82.553,"We will hear arguments next in No. 1874, Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Union."
1976.75-1874,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,83.5,87.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1016.651,1019.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.155,1158.573,"Mr. Geller, may I interrupt because I missed something, I know both you and the Attorney General have mentioned that there was a Fourteenth Amendment violation found by the District Court."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1158.573,1159.178,That is correct.
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.178,1159.885,Is that correct?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1162.79,1166.553,"No, for the first part of the opinion, Mr. Justice Stevens, was the First Amendment considerations."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.592,1193.054,"As I read it, what it was saying was that they have a First Amendment right, and the measure of the right should be the same as is given to these other organizations."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1198.366,1200.128,"No, I believe that it did, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.75-1874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.285,1209.38,Look at Page 29 of the opinion to be found in the jurisdictional statement.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1217.846,1219.492,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1221.76,1229.462,"First of all, our business is Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment is not applicable to the State of North Carolina, it is applicable only to..."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1229.462,1235.592,"Fourteenth Amendment, that is correct, but I assume Mr. Justice Stevens was talking about the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.592,1239.792,"Wouldn't, you think that is critical of the District Court’s analysis, the Equal Protection argument?"
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1239.792,1253.986,"Yes, we do, certainly -- but this Court, as we read the opinion, did not extend the First Amendment discussion or the Fourteenth Amendment as it incorporates the First, so far as to say that the prisoners have a First Amendment right to receive mass mailings or to allow outsiders to come in to talk to them."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.437,1268.482,Thank you.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1268.482,1279.253,"Now, we have discussed in some length in our brief the serious problems that may reasonably be anticipated in the area of prisoner rehabilitation if inmate unions are allowed to function within the prison system."
1976.75-1874,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1360.29,1381.208,"Well, as Mr. Justice Stevens said, what is the significance of paragraph 1 in Page 32; whatever right of association of any prisoners derived from the First Amendment, they have no right to form or belong to a labor union for the purpose of taking concerted actions to force their demands upon prison administrators."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1382.614,1387.422,"I think it means, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the District Court acknowledged that if at some future time."
1976.75-1874,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1387.422,1397.149,If you have been saying the demand here is that they want in a concerted fashion to assert certain rights as a prison union.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1397.149,1398.281,That is correct.
1976.75-1874,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1398.281,1401.767,"Well, doesn’t this say they do not have those rights?"
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1401.767,1412.39,"It states that if any time in the future they begin to act as a group for the purpose of engaging in acts that the State may legitimately prohibit, the State at that point may move in."
1976.75-1874,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.55,1423.471,"Is that what it says -- I thought it said whatever right they may have, if any, they have no right to form or belong to a labor union for the purpose of taking concerted action."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1423.471,1435.506,"I understand that, Mr. Justice Brennan, but under the District Court’s opinion, these collection of inmates would be allowed to engage in the first steps that we believe would lead inevitably to concerted activity, there would be no..."
1976.75-1874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1435.506,1455.863,Must that not be read with paragraph 2 and 3 on Page 32; paragraph 3 saying the Union and its inmate members shall be accorded the privilege of holding meetings generally under the same conditions as the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts and the Alcoholics Anonymous.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1455.863,1459.963,"Well, that of course Mr. Chief Justice relates to the equal protection analysis of the District Court."
1976.75-1874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1459.963,1461.976,I am talking about whether it was.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1461.976,1462.334,I think the opinion.
1976.75-1874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1462.334,1473.168,"From whatever source it derives, the impact on the prison is determined not by what is said in the opinion primarily but what is said on Page 32 under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, that is the order of the Court."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1473.168,1478.79,"That is correct, and that is incorporated in the judgment which follows in Appendix B, that is correct."
1976.75-1874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.89,1518.378,"And all these derives from the holding of the Court that although there is no constitutional right to form a union, once they have been permitted to form a union and invite the AA and the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Boys Scouts and others in, they must accord to this union precisely the same privileges as are accorded to these other organizations."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1518.378,1518.776,That is the equal protection analysis.
1976.75-1874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.776,1522.409,Including meetings and concerted action within the prison.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1522.409,1527.618,"The District Court has held that under the Equal Protection Clause, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct, and we disagree with that."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1591.252,1598.548,Couldn’t these very same men set up an AA unit?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1598.548,1599.482,"Well, they could."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1599.482,1600.419,Could they?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1600.419,1603.044,We do not think it is important what they call their group.
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1603.044,1605.754,Could they set up an AA unit?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1605.754,1612.097,"If the warden would allow it, they would have to submit a charter to the warden explaining what the goals of the organization are, it does not really matter what they call themselves."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.097,1614.856,And they set it up as an AA unit.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1614.856,1615.555,"That is correct, it would be monitored."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1615.555,1625.197,And they have meetings at which meetings they decide to use concerted action to break down the rules in the yard.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1626.31,1628.563,"Obviously, the prison authorities would move in at that point."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1628.563,1631.958,But why would it not be just the same if it was called a union?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1631.958,1633.186,Because if it is called Alcoholics Anonymous.
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1633.186,1634.992,It is the same people.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1634.992,1636.546,"I understand that, Mr. Justice Marshall, but if it is called Alcoholics."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.546,1640.031,"But then because it is a union, it cannot meet."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1640.031,1640.65,If it calls itself a union.
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.65,1645.328,"Well, suppose the Union meets on AA principles, that would not be any good, would it, because it is called a union."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1645.328,1648.613,"It does not matter, we believe, what it calls itself."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.07,1653.202,"Well, why is it banned?"
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1653.202,1654.084,It is banned because it is an...
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.084,1655.139,Because it is an union.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1655.139,1664.075,"No, because its announced goals are inimical to the rehabilitation of inmates and to the valid correctional goals of institutional security."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.075,1666.937,And why is that?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1666.937,1672.864,"As I have explained, we think that an organized group of inmates has the inherent potential."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.864,1675.27,So the organizing is important?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1675.27,1681.287,"No, it is not the organizing, it is the fact that they have coalesced together for the purpose of presenting grievances."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1681.287,1683.458,Is the coalescing together the point?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1683.458,1687.085,"No, it is what the impact is of what they plan to do."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1688.064,1689.874,What do they plan to do?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1689.874,1698.442,"They plan to present grievances, as we understand it, although there has been some fluctuation, they plan to present grievances to prison officials about conditions."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.442,1699.51,What is wrong with that?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1699.51,1703.587,I think on an individualized basis it is not wrong and it certainly has to be encouraged.
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.432,1718.734,Couldn’t they get together in the yard and have a meeting in the corner of the yard?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1718.734,1720.477,"Obviously, there is a limit to the pervasive."
1976.75-1874,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.477,1721.63,Couldn’t they do it?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1721.63,1737.88,"The question is we believe what legitimate steps the prison officials are allowed to take at the outset, when the organization has announced what its goals are, must it wait, as Mr. Safron has said, until these evils actually come to pass before it may take the first steps?"
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.88,1751.868,"It seems to me if you rest your response to Justice Marshall on the goals of the Union as being improper, but the District Court found that there was no evidence tending to show that the inmates intend to operate the Union to hamper and interfere with the proper interest of government."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1756.403,1758.129,"I do not think I can agree, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.283,1793.667,Are the findings to that effect?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1793.667,1798.614,I think that the appellees do not deny that these unions will be operated from within the prison.
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.614,1802.927,Are the findings to that effect?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1804.315,1806.182,I am not certain that the District Court..
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.182,1809.603,"Should we decide the case on the basis of the findings, or should we do it de novo?"
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1809.603,1820.031,"No, I think that the findings do indicate the fact that this union is made up primarily of prison inmates, and that it is governed by democratic principles, and therefore, I would assume that the majority vote would be made up of prisoners rather than outsiders."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.031,1825.585,"In that respect is it not just like Mr. Justice Marshall, said hey, your difference as I understand is in their announced goals."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1825.585,1826.424,Absolutely.
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.424,1829.212,And the District Court found the announced goals were harmless.
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1829.212,1838.104,"The District Court did, but we think that the District Court did not defer substantially to the expert judgment of correctional officials who should be able to look at these goals."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.104,1840.627,So you are asking us to set aside the District Court’s findings?
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1840.627,1846.418,"No, we think that the District Court’s findings are in clear violation of what this Court said in Pell v. Procunier."
1976.75-1874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.408,1869.354,"You maybe entirely right but that is an argument for the proposition that the findings are erroneous, that is what you are arguing, I think."
1976.75-1874,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1869.354,1884.602,"We do not think it is a question of findings and fact, we think it is a question of what legal standard the District Court should bring to bear on the facts in the particular case, and we think that in this case it gave absolutely no deference to the legitimate findings and anticipated fears of the correctional officials."
1976.75-1874,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2009.944,2012.242,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1874,3,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3958.812,3961.95,"Yes, Your Honor, just a bit."
