1969.301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.157,"Number 301, Pike against Church."
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,36.587,40.062,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,417.111,427.202,"Well Mr. Lee, what's -- tell me, you cited some prior case, but what would you suppose the justification is for states saying you may not ship in bulk out of the state?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,435.911,444.119,"Well, in the answer to that question Mr. Justice White lies the entire justification of the Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,444.119,450.351,"I know, but what if the fellow you say that -- he says â€œWell look, I'm going to ship in bulk out of the state."
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,457.452,460.21,There are number of answers to that question.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.425,470.277,"And so, you're not going to hurt if they are bad cantaloupes?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,470.277,472.09,"Yes, we are."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.145,495.253,They won't be counted in --
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,495.253,497.494,"Then they won't be counted, that is correct."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.083,510.905,This has to be the sole basis for them for more preventing bulk shipments where they are not going to be identified upon being packed as Arizona cantaloupes?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,510.905,515.972,"No sir, I submit that it is not, there are additional reasons."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.463,551.093,"Well so, it's again, you want them identified as Arizona cantaloupes, and add it up and Arizona will get credit for these, they are bad, you don't want credit for them, do you?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,551.093,557.554,"And pursuant to that, let me proceed with the example that you gave of cantaloupes which are shipped in bulk across the state line."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.971,569.708,"By the way, do you have a regulation that state says how far you may transport cantaloupes and picked up to the packing point?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,569.708,571.124,No sir.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.124,586.206,"Do you know that -- how far they are normally transported when they're picked up in the field -- I suppose that you defined, but maybe they are carried 20 or 30 miles within the State of Arizona to a packing point?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,586.206,586.702,That is possible.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.149,590.23,And at least as far as they're carried here across the state line.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,590.23,591.492,I would think that would be possible.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.492,591.984,"Okay, go ahead."
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,591.984,597.166,The point that I'm about to be make is that they can be carried a good deal farther.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.238,673.958,"Well, you got the --"
1969.301,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.958,677.609,But what about the standards in California?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,680.332,681.571,Well frankly --
1969.301,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.571,686.401,Is there any difference between the fruits standards in California in those in Arizona?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,686.401,693.462,"Yes Mr. Justice Marshall, there are and those are set forth, they're discussed --"
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.462,695.04,Which way did they operate?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,695.04,697.055,"Well, --"
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.055,697.784,I mean are they higher or lower than that?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,697.784,710.546,"We feel -- there are, -- you know, that --- though the differences in language of the statute would indicate that Arizona standards are more demanding than California standards."
1969.301,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.755,716.304,"Well, what interest does Arizona have in protecting the people of California?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,716.304,719.299,None Mr. Justice Marshall.
1969.301,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.316,724.213,Protecting the name of Arizona?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,724.213,725.932,"That is correct, that is correct."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.444,780.537,Do you -- of the California inspectors if they want to ship these cantaloupes back into Arizona for retail sale?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,780.537,782.022,"Certificate, but what?"
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.022,792.547,Well I suppose you -- I suppose you have regulations against to check on the quality of imported cantaloupe?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,792.547,794.077,Yes.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.0,798.746,You don't re-inspect them do you when they shipped back into Arizona?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,798.746,800.531,I'm sure that we wouldn't.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.08,809.067,Make sure you would accept the certificate of the California inspector if the California law meets what you think is a reasonable standard?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,809.067,810.4,Yes.
1969.301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,996.084,1008.82,"Does this record show whether when these cantaloupes are marketed in California or any other state, they are identified after the package is broken as Arizona cantaloupe?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1008.82,1009.788,Mr. Chief Justice Burger --
1969.301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1009.788,1010.333,-- markets and sold --
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1010.333,1016.308,"-- this record does not show anything on that, and I would think it would be a matter of individual choice with the grocer."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.938,1042.608,Did the District Court -- how do you read the opinion of District Court?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1047.145,1051.171,I read the opinion of the District Court with the great difficultly Mr. Justice White.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.171,1053.28,"It implied that, didn't it?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1053.28,1054.289,It certainly did.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.289,1060.048,"And to the extent that it did, we aren't very that position to disagree with that, are we?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1060.048,1062.634,I know what you referring to Mr. Justice White.
1969.301,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.238,1075.384,It's a little more than that I think.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1082.28,1093.801,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I submit that under circumstances such as this, there simply is no way that you can read the statute any other way."
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.145,1115.113,That state was the administrator's had been vague and unlawful.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1115.113,1115.74,That is correct.
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.74,1120.682,"They administer the law for a long period of years, quite the contrary?"
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1120.682,1121.502,And I learned my lesson --
1969.301,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.502,1122.466,Is that right?
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1122.466,1128.359,"Mr. -- yes that is correct, there were individual instances in which the administrator for not obeying the law."
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1252.983,1254.044,But before you move on --
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1254.044,1254.293,Yes.
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.293,1261.086,Sligh against -- you kept repeatedly relying on three decisions as I -- my ears have heard it.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1261.086,1262.074,Yes.
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.074,1265.449,Sligh against Kirkwood and the Pacific States Box and Basket case --
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1265.449,1266.553,"Yes, and Turner versus Maryland."
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1266.553,1268.822,"In Turner against Maryland, I don't' think it's in your briefs."
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1268.822,1273.881,"Well, it is but it slips in there -- look on page 31."
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1273.881,1277.232,Alright.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1277.232,1282.952,It is cited in Mr. Justice Brandies' opinion of Pacific States Box & Basket Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.952,1283.971,The internal reference.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1283.971,1284.996,That is correct.
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1293.958,1295.734,-- a little that more star --
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1295.734,1297.079,That's correct.
1969.301,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.079,1299.179,Thank you.
1969.301,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1299.179,1317.043,"But these three cases, I submit to the Court clearly established the legitimate interest of the state, and that's all we have to show is that the state does have, the legitimate interest in preserving the reputation of its fruits and vegetables by setting these standards of quality and of pack."
1969.301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.213,1455.775,Thank you Mr. Lee.
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1459.705,1465.067,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.281,1506.114,"Well, I didn't understand this argument that way."
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1525.471,1543.527,"Mr. Chief Justice, the argument of appellant is that Parker fruit is good fruit and he wants it to be labeled as good fruit."
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1726.259,1729.0,"Well, I thought the Sligh case certainly --"
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1729.0,1729.429,"Your Honor, the Sligh --"
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.429,1731.745,-- was very much to that subject?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1731.745,1746.538,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, the Sligh case involved a statute which stated simply that citrus fruits unfit for consumption shall not be handled."
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.568,1840.904,Suppose there's a factual difference that you -- you probably can't send raspberries in a bulk in truckloads.
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1848.238,1865.882,We submit that the Pacific States decision was correct Your Honor that a state may provide that where commodities are packed within the state certain containers shall be used.
1969.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.818,1891.085,How about Turner against Maryland --
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,1891.085,1895.778,Turner against Maryland -- I think this case gets -- this case gets closer.
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.569,2049.166,Did they grow up cantaloupe on the Blight side?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2049.166,2062.275,"Yes, on the Blight side and because these are growers who don't enjoy federal subsidies, whose production cost and transportation and costs are among the highest in the nation."
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.962,2176.327,"What -- when you packed at Arizona cantaloupes at Blight, do you put at California -- are you required of California law to say that they are California cantaloupes or just that they are packed at Blight?"
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2176.327,2186.845,The California Mr. Justice White does have a law similar to that of Arizona which requires some identification on the container.
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.675,2211.056,Packed in season?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2211.056,2215.527,Packed in season in Arizona and California.
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.527,2220.323,"Well, why would it -- that's the label that you put on to your Blight's pack, Arizona cantaloupes --"
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2220.323,2222.722,"That's our trade, yes."
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.722,2230.257,Why would you say Arizona because they aren't packed in Arizona?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2230.257,2245.267,"This is what appears on the crate, packed and seasoned in Arizona and California indicates that packing may go one in each state."
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.658,2257.524,But isn't that what Arizona's legislature is claiming or by this statute claim was the right to have Arizona products identified as such?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2257.524,2268.589,"In response to this point Mr. Chief Justice, I believe I should explain how these cantaloupes are marketed."
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.73,2319.144,Who are these buyers?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2319.144,2320.956,These are wholesale jobbers.
1969.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.938,2332.337,How about their customers?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2332.337,2340.516,"Their customers are in turn are receivers, the car lot receivers all over the country who receive these in car lots."
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2377.763,2383.054,I don't know how you can generalize that way on the state of this record.
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2399.035,2399.82,Yes --
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.82,2406.811,"Now, each of those states has an important interest in protecting that, do they not?"
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2409.998,2410.602,The Sligh case --
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2410.602,2412.901,-- about and Turner as well?
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2412.901,2436.518,The Sligh case Your Honor if I may submit is a case -- is a health and safety measure which seeks to prevent the use of citrus fruits unfit for consumption.
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.636,2468.558,"Maybe that was the -- maybe that's what the record supported, but the court seemed to go beyond that because this Court's had the protection of the state's reputation in foreign markets, with the consequent beneficial effect upon the great home industry may have been within the legislative intent?"
1969.301,1,28868,jacob_abramson,,2468.558,2486.986,"Yes, to prevent export of poor fruit, but appellant here does not stress this, but stresses rather the credit for good fruit."
1969.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2631.622,2634.395,Thank you Mr. Abramson.
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2636.389,2647.034,Thank you Your Honor.
1969.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2705.423,2707.191,Isn't it -- is it the effect of the statute?
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2707.191,2710.074,"In this case Mr. Justice Stewart, that is correct."
1969.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2710.074,2711.997,"Not cantaloupes, that is to be packed inside the state?"
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2711.997,2714.939,There is no question in this case that that is correct.
1969.301,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.881,2883.468,Before you --
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2883.468,2883.567,Yes.
1969.301,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.567,2895.815,"-- before you get to your summary, has this statute involving as you suggest many other products of Arizona been challenged in the state courts at any time?"
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2895.815,2897.364,Never on these grounds Your Honor.
1969.301,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.261,2911.729,None of the issues involved here?
1969.301,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2911.729,2921.175,None of the issues involved here have ever been passed upon -- have even been passed upon by a state court.
1969.301,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.296,3042.559,"Thank you for your submission Mr. Lee, thank you Mr. Abramson."
