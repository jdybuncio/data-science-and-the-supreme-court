1968.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.838,"Number 35, Carl F. Grunenthal, petitioner v. the Long Island Railroad Company, et al."
1968.35,0,36363,milford_j_meyer,,28.187,32.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1028.419,1033.884,You may.
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1035.265,1038.719,Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Justices.
1968.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.724,1139.051,"The Court of Appeals was unanimous with respect to its power, was it?"
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1139.051,1141.299,"That was unanimous with respect to its power, yes."
1968.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.992,1149.31,"Basically, he simply disagreed on the facts of this case?"
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1149.31,1157.681,Disagreed on the facts of this case and he said that he would uphold the determination of Judge Irving Ben Cooper in the trial court.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1434.822,1437.522,Would that be reviewed by any a higher court?
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1437.522,1441.382,My information is it could not be reviewed by any trial -- higher court.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1441.382,1452.128,-- common law it was only the court that the case was tried even though some of the judges participated who would not preside in the trial.
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1452.128,1461.359,I think it’s formalistic to say that it was only the Court before whom the case was tried because three of the men sitting on the Court have not tried the case.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1461.359,1472.85,Well I ask you was it not the same judges of the same Court meeting together which was composed of the judges who tried it and the other judges who didn’t try.
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1472.85,1473.857,It was Your Honor it was --
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1473.857,1475.885,Composed but not subject to appeal.
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1475.885,1477.623,It was not subject to appeal.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1477.623,1480.799,So that’s the issue that’s the facts of the common law procedure.
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1480.799,1502.945,"That’s the facts and my suggestion is that those facts particularly the circumstance, the three judges who had not sit in on or sat down on the trial, have not reviewed the demeanor of the witnesses and were looking at it from afar in effect did participate in the examination of the challenge of the jury verdict as being excessive."
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1548.769,1557.423,If this case had been tried in the state court what court would you first set aside the verdict excessive?
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1557.423,1562.664,"In the state court I should think the trial court, the court of first instance."
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1562.664,1563.601,Is there a procedure there?
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1576.81,1581.331,It is not true in the Southern District of New York which is where this case came up from.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1581.331,1583.767,Is it true in the State of New York?
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1595.11,1597.929,Your Honor I regret to say I'm not on an expert on New York practice.
1968.35,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1605.116,1607.076,"What about Pennsylvania, do you know about that?"
1968.35,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1607.076,1619.982,I'm sorry I don’t know that.
1968.35,2,36363,milford_j_meyer,,2757.24,2761.657,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
