1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,33.63,36.86,May it please the Court.
1962.178,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,304.005,313.298,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,313.298,313.972,"No, Your Honor."
1962.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.181,412.356,But those are the only ones that were --
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,412.356,412.756,That's right.
1962.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.756,413.487,-- included in this deficiency assessment?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,413.487,414.924,That's right.
1962.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.924,418.165,"Only those delivered to the customers on trucks in the State of Utah, am I right?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,418.165,418.812,That is correct.
1962.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.812,419.176,Yes.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,419.176,426.623,"But General, I take it, (Inaudible)"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,426.623,427.907,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.013,454.14,That is -- is that a matter of the construction of your own statute or do you say that the constitutional requirement --
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,454.14,464.91,The sales tax law in Utah is contained in several sections but one of them says that the tax applies to every consummated transaction of sale.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.338,476.741,"You don't -- you don't suggest that you're forced to exempt these sales and make the common carrier -- whether the deliveries made to a common carrier, do you?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,476.741,479.546,We feel that that isn't before the Court.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.202,502.038,"Well, but in this -- in this case that's before the Court, do you think there's really substantially a lot of difference between delivery to a common carrier where under the Uniform Sales Act, the title passes at the time you delivered it to a common carrier and the delivery to a man own trucks?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,502.038,508.458,The case has generally upheld that delivery to a common carrier is not delivery to the ultimate consumer.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.302,510.756,But the risk is on --
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,510.756,511.159,-- for purposes of --
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.159,515.01,-- the risk -- who is the risk on when it's delivered to a common carrier?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,515.01,517.847,This is often a matter a contractual agreement.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.847,520.782,"But when there isn't a contractual arrangement, who's the risk for losses --"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,520.782,522.717,Usually the risk is on the carrier.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.717,526.693,When the risk -- which means that the carrier can't pay the risk of the buyer?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,526.693,527.493,That's correct.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.493,533.527,And on -- and who's got title to it -- who's got the insurable interest in it?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,533.527,536.839,You're talking about the situation where a common carrier carries the property?
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.839,538.373,Yes.
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,538.373,539.506,Well --
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.506,547.551,"Well, I mean, I'm just wondering what the really the substantial difference is between delivery to the common carrier and delivery to the man's own truck?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,547.551,553.536,I can't personally see any substantial difference as far as the -- the theory that we're proceeding in this case on.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.854,560.835,"By which you mean, the sale is in fact been consummated --"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,560.835,560.991,Yes.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.991,561.647,-- in Utah?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,561.647,562.081,That's absolutely right.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,562.081,575.293,"Because I take it that Utah law was that on delivery to a common carrier, the sale is com -- within Utah, the sale was consummated within Utah, you wouldn't recognize any constitutional discovery, would you?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,575.293,575.692,No.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,575.692,578.043,With that fact as one of the Federal Constitution?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,578.043,588.357,That the construction of the -- of the Utah law and the regulations of the Commission at the present time have precluded taxation of this kind of situation.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,641.895,644.382,"I don't suppose that's blown up, anyway?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,644.382,644.568,No.
1962.178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.542,650.02,My eyes are not that good for these.
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,650.02,673.533,"The invoices which accompany these goods -- this is in larger print, Exhibit 4E on page 158, is typical of these invoices and if you will notice paragraph four provides, delivery is to be made FOB to seller's foundry upon which the seller's responsibility ceases."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,673.533,674.337,What paragraph?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,674.337,682.926,"Paragraph four, on page 158, delivery is to be made FOB to seller's foundry upon which the seller's responsibility ceases."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1018.367,1025.246,"In those cases, were they negotiated outside the state?"
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1025.246,1028.263,"One of them was and one of them wasn't, I understand."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1043.0,1059.302,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1059.302,1060.72,That is basically correct.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1066.778,1070.346,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1070.346,1071.504,Yes.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1071.504,1072.642,The acceptance?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1072.642,1076.418,"No, the acceptance was always in Utah."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1076.418,1086.571,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1086.571,1089.07,Perhaps Mr. Gilmore can clarify this more than I can.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1144.009,1152.771,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1152.771,1157.715,"I don't believe, in practice, it is, although the exhibit I just said was signed by the pipe company."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1157.715,1160.973,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1160.973,1163.69,I don't know about the procedure involving that as a whole.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1163.69,1169.457,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1169.457,1172.529,No.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1172.529,1183.77,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1183.77,1193.926,I think concededly that the -- that the pipe company was obligated at that time to deliver these goods to the foreign job site.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1198.903,1205.295,"I understand that, but I was wondering what happened practically at the time when these sales are initiated."
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1205.295,1208.275,I think your understanding is correct on that.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.857,1289.093,Did you say Colorado would do that?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1289.093,1291.951,"Yes, Your Honor, they will."
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.951,1298.786,"I thought the use tax there had an exemption -- had a credit for any, any sales tax had paid."
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1298.786,1301.578,I wish I had been able to find that exemption because I haven't.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.578,1306.161,You know as a matter of practice whether do it or whether you just can't find it?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1306.161,1308.837,I don't know as a matter of practice and I haven't been able to find it.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.837,1314.442,So you actually think that we -- it probably adverted to International Harvester is here?
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1314.442,1315.657,I think so.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.657,1324.077,Although perhaps it ought to be raised when -- when the fellow pays his use tax in Colorado.
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1324.077,1328.764,The respondent is registered with the State of Colorado to correct -- to collect use tax.
1962.178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.764,1328.927,Yes.
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1328.927,1334.516,"And as a matter of fact, I understand that it did collect tax on these transactions."
1962.178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1338.793,1344.649,All these exhibits to which you referred is -- I know this indicates the 2% Colorado use tax have been (Voice Overlap) --
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1344.649,1347.768,That's correct.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1717.069,1729.922,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1729.922,1736.748,"The classical distinction, Your Honor, is the point of asset you've titled."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1736.748,1742.766,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1742.766,1743.824,"No, I don't think so."
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1743.824,1745.046,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1745.046,1755.11,I think that will be one point in Utah with a full freight allowed to a point outside of Utah is really a meaningless conglomeration.
1962.178,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1771.178,1782.496,(Inaudible)
1962.178,0,24057,f_burton_howard,,1782.496,1798.716,"It is but the -- the significant considerations here are that FOB, means passage of title and the responsibility for bearing the freight is also an indicia who actually owns the goods at the time."
1962.178,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1816.066,1819.154,Mr. Gilmour.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,1819.154,1823.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2190.726,2191.411,That is correct.

1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2205.021,2205.793,That's right.

1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2226.697,2231.123,That particular quotation is then signed by him.
1962.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2246.87,2250.53,It was first signed by both parties and then it was submitted.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2250.53,2250.681,Yes.

1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2476.982,2479.333,We --
1962.178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.333,2489.739,"They ruled -- didn't they rule on the constitutional ground that the reason that the -- that the law may -- may cover it, but that it can't because of the United States Constitution?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2489.739,2493.249,"That -- that is correct, Mr. Justice."
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2864.84,2881.98,"But do I understand that these -- do you think that either those two cases overruled International Harvester statement that as the sale take place in the state even though it's to be delivered out of the state, it can be taxed by the state -- by the state of the carrier?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2881.98,2889.337,"International Harvester, Mr. Justice Black is -- has not been overruled."
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2905.805,2907.673,To be delivered in another state --
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2907.673,2919.546,"Well, he transported it -- he transported under the stipulated facts that were involved in that case, he took title, he took delivery, and then he thereafter transported those goods --"
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2919.546,2921.332,But he was -- he was to do that.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2924.229,2942.059,Under -- under the -- under the stipulated facts there the -- it was -- it was clear that the contract between seller and buyer did not require an interstate of shipment of goods.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2942.059,2943.662,And may I ask you just one more question --
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2943.662,2943.763,Yes.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2943.763,2947.627,-- because this is very important point to me.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2964.373,2966.223,That -- that's correct.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.835,2985.636,"It's irrelevant, so that it can be taxed."
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,2985.636,2989.229,It can be taxed because that's a locally consummated sale.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3010.8,3017.134,I'm just (Voice Overlap) -- I evidently overlooked some -- not understood some of your statement.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3034.739,3038.637,"No, the contracts here are all setup."
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3064.614,3068.525,What's the difference in that in the Wood Preserving?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3068.525,3088.246,"The Wood Preserving situation, like the Harvester case was a fully consummated local sale where the only -- there was no -- no requirement in the contract that necessitated an interstate transport of the goods."
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3088.246,3088.399,But that was not relevant.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3088.399,3089.431,The bill of lading --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3089.431,3091.086,That was irrelevant.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3091.086,3099.35,The bill of lading in the Wood Preserving case was held in view of the completed delivery and transfer of title in Indiana to be irrelevant.

1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3105.555,3111.926,The title -- the technical title passed to FOB foundry and --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3111.926,3112.948,"Well, I won't ask anymore."
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3113.299,3114.348,Yes.
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.327,3134.493,"You mean the cause Mr. Gilmour, the end -- the destination -- partly, a completed transaction was that the pipe gets to its destination --"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3134.493,3134.614,That's --
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3134.614,3143.164,"-- in a sense that it's all wrapped up into the fitting arrangement that you described to us awhile ago, is that the distinction you're drawing?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3143.164,3158.251,"Yes, that is it, Mr. Justice, but I might also add that in all these cases, the pipe is paid for out of the proceeds of the particular governmental job."
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3158.251,3169.768,"For example, suppose they're building a sewer system or something out in Colorado, and that also takes all different kinds of specification of the pipe and the rest of it?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3169.768,3170.18,That's correct.
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3170.18,3186.257,And you described the truck -- you in effect say that there's no transaction completed notwithstanding the technical type of the pipe until it's -- this pipe special specification arrives at the job site in Colorado.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3186.257,3186.582,Absolutely.
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3186.582,3188.836,"In that sense, interstate is in effect?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3188.836,3194.95,"That's -- that's right and the, and the -- and each -- and each sale is paid for out of the proceeds of that particular job."
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3194.95,3197.815,By the Colorado governmental agency or maybe --
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3197.815,3199.6,That's -- that is correct.
1962.178,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3199.999,3224.806,(Inaudible)
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3224.806,3261.875,"Because under the record, all of the -- in all these cases, the pipe is paid for out of the job before any quotation is made or contract entered into the sales department of the respondent gets a legal description of the real property where that pipe is going to be buried, so that it can file a mechanic's lien in order to get a collection or it gets the name of the bonding company if the job bonded so that a job can -- so that a suit could be filed against the bonding company."
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3282.848,3289.372,"Well that -- doesn't your client couldn't pay the interest, Mr. Gilmour, unless the pipe gets to the job?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3289.372,3293.951,"The evidence, Mr. Justice, is that they're paid for out of the proceeds."
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3294.297,3298.184,"Well, I suppose there'd be no proceed unless the pipe gets in place --"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3298.184,3298.681,That's --
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3298.681,3299.95,-- on the job?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3299.95,3300.544,That's correct.
1962.178,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.544,3310.013,"Is that to say then that unless the pipe actually gets into place, at this job site in Colorado, you wouldn't get paid for it?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3310.013,3320.874,That is the evidence here that the pipe is paid for in practically all cases out of the proceeds of the particular job on which it's used.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3321.196,3323.12,Does that mean that they don't always pay you?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3323.12,3324.189,The contractor --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3324.189,3327.371,"When you deliver it to them, that they don't owe you the money then?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3327.371,3330.032,The contractor owes it by --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3330.032,3332.434,"From when, from what time?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3332.434,3351.307,"The invoices provide 30 days in that, but the evidence is that -- and in the light of this information about the legal description of the real estate and the method of payment that it comes -- he's paid for out of the proceeds of the particular job on which it's used."
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3351.307,3357.92,"If it were lost on the way, would that relief the purchaser?"
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3371.052,3376.329,The risk of loss is technically --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3376.329,3377.462,I'm not talking about technically.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3377.462,3378.362,In the buyer.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3378.362,3379.228,What?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3379.228,3379.349,The risk of --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.349,3379.878,The buyer?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3379.878,3381.554,The risk of loss is in the buyer.
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3381.554,3381.929,Why?
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3383.61,3385.539,Because he has title to the goods in transit --
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3385.539,3387.119,And has been delivered to him.
1962.178,1,19003,c_m_gilmour,,3387.119,3400.308,"And it has been -- it has been delivered to him, but it has been delivered to him for the sole and the paid purpose as in the case of a common carrier if hauling that -- hauling those goods to that particular sewerage or water works --"
1962.178,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3400.308,3407.927,But the transaction is over so far as they're concerned with reference to the establishment of liability for the purchase of the goods?
