1992.91-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,47.397,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1353, Thomas F. Conroy v. Walter Aniskoff."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,73.279,76.464,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1353,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.047,396.022,"Mr. Klonoff, the statute really doesn't say that any property sold in violation of the Federal prohibition is not effectively sold, does it?"
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,415.334,418.702,"I don't think that the State could do that, they could override the statute."
1992.91-1353,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.221,421.404,"Well, they're not overriding the statute."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,426.291,427.891,"--Well, it has that effect."
1992.91-1353,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.891,431.028,"If you say so, but I mean, that's what I'm asking."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,447.305,453.308,"But the whole concept of a redemption is the right to actually... if title is passed, the right to take back title."
1992.91-1353,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.112,473.503,"You're saying that Maine does not have the authority to give title until that period is passed, and because it is tolled Maine therefore can never give even... cannot even give a good title subject to defeasance later."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,473.503,475.205,Not inconsistent with the statute.
1992.91-1353,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.667,508.609,"No, but I just wanted to make sure that I understood what you were saying to Justice Scalia, and I thought the theory that you were espousing was that because the period of service is not included... cannot be included in computing the redemption period, that the redemption period never runs."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,515.815,521.186,"Well, that's right, but in some States the title actually will pass, subject to the redemption."
1992.91-1353,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,525.805,528.59,"But that's not the way it works, on your view, in Maine, is it?"
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,528.59,529.073,"No, that's right."
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.751,756.071,May I ask you a question about this case just to get it fixed in my mind?
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,761.625,762.059,That's right.
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.059,772.183,"--And therefore your client has a right to redeem, and I gather your position is he will retain that right to redeem as long as he remains on active duty."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,772.183,775.402,"Well, he's actually now retired, although that's not reflected--"
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.402,783.824,"Well, then he just has the right to redeem as of now, so he could be compelled to exercise it within a fixed period of time, could he?"
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,783.824,784.257,--That's correct.
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.732,801.536,"He would have to make a tender of the back taxes plus interest, whatever the statute provides for redemption."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,801.536,802.336,That's exactly right.
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.336,818.562,"If you had a person... you don't, as I understand it... who was still on active duty and he's perhaps going to serve another 15, 20 years, would he have the right under the statute, under your view, to say to the property owner, I haven't decided what I want to do."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,826.584,833.805,"He would have that right, and I think then the property owner would have civil causes of action available, and that would be true, by the way, to the taxing authority."
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.773,836.959,They could sue for the back taxes.
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,836.959,838.542,"--Exactly, levy taxes."
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.402,858.539,"Well, I suppose the practical matter is he might well be willing to sell the property for a sum."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,864.692,865.792,--That's correct.
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.792,872.965,"--And the longer the period, the more of a nuisance rights he has, the better bargaining position he is in in that negotiation."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,872.965,897.248,"Well, that's correct, but let me provide, if I could, some perspective on that, because really what we're talking about and the assumption, I think, of the so-called absurd consequences is the idea of a service member who has a valid and just debt just really out of reasons for dishonesty not paying off the debt and trying to abuse, if you will, the rights that are provided."
1992.91-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,911.257,915.642,What does Article 134 provide that's relevant to this case?
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,915.642,934.271,"--Well, what it provides is that an individual can be court-martialled for conduct of a nature that would bring discredit on the Armed Forces, and there are a number of cases, such as United States v. Sivinovich, the U.S. Army Court of Military Review of 1988, applying that precisely to the bad debt situation."
1992.91-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.271,941.442,Does it bring discredit on the Armed Forces to exercise rights granted by Congress to an officer of the United States Army?
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,941.442,944.728,"That's what the Court has held, if there is a just debt."
1992.91-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.462,994.661,"Those may well deal with individual cases, Mr. Klonoff, but if we're now turning to the bad consequences of adopting the position you say the statute requires, I think perhaps from the point of view of the State or the town, it's simply an inability to sell at a tax sale."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,998.446,1002.481,"Well, we would respectfully disagree that that's the outcome."
1992.91-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.106,1050.045,"Yes, but a quit claim deed is a good deal different than... you can't get title insurance on the basis of a quit claim deed."
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1050.045,1058.151,"--Well, that's correct, and that's why a person purchasing the property takes all kinds of risks, and this is something, along with many other things, that can be looked into."
1992.91-1353,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.248,1090.622,Did I understand you to say that Maine can proceed in personam for the amount of the delinquent taxes against the property owner?
1992.91-1353,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1090.622,1091.522,"Yes, that is right."
1992.91-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.135,1115.004,"Very well, Mr. Klonoff."
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1122.677,1125.629,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.841,1234.148,"The Federal Government might have wanted to protect by Federal law a BFP in the one situation, and decided not to protect him by Federal law in the other, but left it open to the State to protect him."
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1238.218,1275.725,"--It is conceivable, Justice Scalia, that that is the case, but it seems to me more likely, given the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme and the extent to which Congress was careful in specifying which remedies would and would not be available and the desire of Congress to protect the service member from various State law judgments and liabilities during the period of service, that it's much more likely that the force of section 525, which is broad and absolute in its terms, must be taken as preemptive of any State law right to vest the title in a bona fide purchaser."
1992.91-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.352,1350.206,"When you say, of the Appendix, are you referring to the Appendix to your brief?"
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1350.206,1355.427,"--No, I apologize, Chief Justice Rehnquist, it's the Appendix to title 50, where the act is codified."
1992.91-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.295,1361.112,Is that cited anywhere in your brief?
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1361.112,1361.664,--It is cited.
1992.91-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.683,1394.135,"Owned and occupied, now."
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1394.135,1400.206,--Owned and occupied by the service member or his dependents or employees.
1992.91-1353,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.02,1608.757,"I take it the provision which allows for the collection of taxes on real property does not apply to him, though, because he was not occupying it for a dwelling."
1992.91-1353,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1608.757,1609.141,That's right.
1992.91-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.831,1672.148,"Thank you, Mr. Manning."
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1679.353,1682.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.216,1727.349,In a timely fashion.
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1727.349,1729.418,"In a timely fashion, Your Honor, yes."
1992.91-1353,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.142,1820.594,"Did you set forth section 560 in your brief, Mr. Cuddy?"
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1820.594,1822.027,"I make reference to it, Your Honor."
1992.91-1353,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.533,1839.222,I would suggest to each of you that if you plan to do that in the future you should not... you should very definitely set forth the statute in your brief.
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1839.222,1843.46,"I fully appreciate that, Your Honor, and I apologize on my behalf--"
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.46,1846.162,So what's your conclusion on what you've just said?
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1846.162,1876.864,"--My conclusion, Your Honor, moving forward from that point, is that this Court in the LeMaistre case back in 1948, which in the last 46 years is the only case which dealt with this section... back in 1948, this Court said, with respect to section 560, 560 and 525 supplement each other, and 560 gives greater protection... greater protection than 525."
1992.91-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.812,1902.831,"Help me with just one thing, though."
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1911.604,1914.139,525 deals with redemption periods.
1992.91-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.889,1916.089,After a sale has taken place.
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1916.089,1916.572,--Right.
1992.91-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.232,1934.018,But he doesn't challenge the... he doesn't say there's any defect in the sale.
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1934.018,1934.719,No.
1992.91-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.289,1947.027,"It gives him an unlimited period, a period... a time to redeem as long as he's in service."
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,1947.027,1954.614,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and section 510 of the act... and this is troublesome to me, and maybe I'm missing this."
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.09,2005.161,"Well, what if this had happened back in 1942 or '43?"
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,2009.632,2011.584,--You're right.
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.584,2020.605,"So we should say, just because Congress has... that even though Congress has not changed the law, we should apply it differently."
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,2020.605,2021.039,No.
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.676,2028.293,Yes.
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,2028.293,2030.795,That's... that's the significant fact.
1992.91-1353,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.628,2034.93,"But that isn't what the law says, in time of war."
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,2034.93,2041.567,"--It says, exigent circumstances, and one has to infer historically what those exigent circumstances were."
1992.91-1353,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.603,2046.805,"Well, that's just a recital at the beginning, isn't it, about exigent circumstances?"
1992.91-1353,2,33784,kevin_m_cuddy,,2054.225,2057.061,"No, it doesn't say that."
1992.91-1353,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2998.834,3007.206,"Unless this Court has any questions, I would simply submit that the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine should be reversed."
1992.91-1353,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.206,3007.673,Very well.
