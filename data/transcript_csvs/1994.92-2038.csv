1994.92-2038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.042,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-2038, Asgrow Seed Company v. Denny Winterboer, et al.--"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,74.189,77.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.92-2038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.168,128.761,Will you repeat the pages number again?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,128.761,129.214,Yes.
1994.92-2038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,132.322,133.087,Thank you.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,133.087,138.804,"They're also at pages 1a and 2a of the merits brief, but they're not on facing pages."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.498,164.091,May I ask a preliminary question?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,189.158,203.309,"--All right, on October 6 Congress amended the first sentence of 2543 and removed everything after the word... outside the word provided through the end of the sentence, such that the first sentence now ends after as provided in this section."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.309,208.478,"And that takes effect not retroactively, but sometime in the future?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,208.478,208.791,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.71,219.505,So this case is not moot.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,219.505,219.755,No.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.193,226.315,"But if it were to come before us under the new statute, it would govern, I suppose."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,229.939,230.236,--Yes.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.655,240.31,It completely eliminates the socalled brown bag exemption.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,240.31,243.965,It eliminates the right to sell such safe seed under the statute.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.965,244.355,Uhhuh.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,245.4,246.15,It probably--
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.15,247.228,"Does it continue to read,"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,249.993,250.696,"--No, they didn't."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.303,256.522,Who do you suppose--
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,264.69,266.907,I think maybe he intentionally remained nameless.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,270.672,272.952,"Before you get into that, just one more question about the amendment."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,283.027,283.979,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.405,316.246,"--It goes into cereal, or beanbags, or something like that."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,316.246,316.746,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.322,365.446,But you concede that he can save the seeds--
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,365.446,367.539,"Right, by--"
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.539,368.46,--for some purposes.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,368.46,368.945,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.023,371.226,"Well, for any purpose."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,400.917,403.196,--There's a lot of reasons for saving soybeans.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.472,421.408,The statute doesn't come into play until the sale is made.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,421.408,422.36,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.36,423.798,And then you have to look at the purpose.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,423.798,424.564,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.73,435.448,At the time of sale.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,435.448,436.136,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.136,454.317,"And the Federal Circuit, in deciding this case, placed a lot of emphasis on the word, marketed, didn't it, in the exception (3), is it, in 2541?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,454.317,454.629,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.124,474.027,"And do you say the term, ""marketing"" necessarily includes selling?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,474.027,474.793,Yes.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.793,477.166,Then it's... marketing should be the broader term--
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,477.166,477.666,It's marketing--
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.666,478.415,--not the selling.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,478.415,480.712,--It's marketing... marketing at a minimum includes selling.
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.369,487.007,"If we agree with you on that, do we have to reverse?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,488.57,494.27,"If you agree with that, that affects the amount of seed that can be saved."
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,499.861,500.955,May I interrupt you there?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,555.244,557.9,"No, Your Honor, that's not correct."
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.9,558.431,Why not?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,558.431,565.366,Because the most that a farmer is going to use on his own farm is that that he would need to replant his farm.
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.583,590.292,"Sure, but he might have planted a crop and decided at the end of the season that he's decided to get out of farming, so he doesn't... and if the market, let's say, for seed, is higher than the market for meal, he might say, I'm going to get out of the business completely, I'm just going to sell all my seed to my neighbors."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,597.415,601.367,--That is a violation because he is selling more than is allowed under the statute.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.938,703.669,"No, but you've left off the... if saved seed in the production of a crop for use on his farm, you left out the words,"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,706.886,707.355,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.355,708.698,"That's critical also, isn't it?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,708.698,708.948,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.102,715.852,"And the question, then, is what is provided in this section?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,715.852,717.944,"--Well, and also what is the amount of such saved seed."
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.797,740.03,"But why do you say it's only in the production of a crop, because in the very next phrase,"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,746.635,751.087,"--Right, but if such saved seed is a definite amount, you could either use it in the production of a crop, or sell it."
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,751.087,751.649,But where do you get the definite amount?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,751.649,754.727,The definite amount comes from the opening clause.
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,755.102,770.938,"Because you're reading the phrase to mean, shall not infringe any right to save seed, and use such saved seed in the... (a) in the production of a crop for use on his farm, or (b) for sale."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,772.063,773.094,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.094,780.186,"So that the for sale necessarily relates back to the saved seed, and if that implies quantity, then the amount that can be sold is subject to that quantity."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,781.137,781.762,Yes.
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.996,785.777,"Well, I mean--"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,785.777,786.964,The quantity is... if I--
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.964,793.023,"--I think you place a lot of stress on the ""except"" clause,"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,816.717,817.467,"--Well, he's not going to--"
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.467,825.948,"Without that ""except"", he'd be able to save as much seed as he wanted for crop production purposes, for future seeding purposes."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,844.691,851.875,"--Well, basically a farmer can save for his own use no more seed than he'll need to plant his farm, sexually--"
1994.92-2038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.875,865.089,"Why is it on the facts of this case there's no dispute that the crop was grown specifically for the purpose of marketing all of it to other... excuse me, not marketing, selling it to other farmers?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,870.884,871.852,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.852,891.64,"--on the farmer's own farm, or was going to be sold for nonreproductive use, that there was an admission that all of it was sold to other farmers."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,891.64,891.875,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,904.182,905.259,And it was sold to others as seed.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,905.259,907.103,--For use as seed for reproductive purposes.
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,907.103,930.312,"And getting back to Justice Scalia's question, or at least the section that he was focusing on, I don't understand why his cultivation of that crop was not a violation of the act under your theory, because this was sexually multiplying a novel variety as a step in marketing, but you told Justice O'Connor that you have to wait till the sale before there's a violation, and I don't understand that."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,930.312,930.531,"No, no."
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.173,965.548,Why?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,973.372,974.2,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.2,978.417,"Why couldn't the soybean farmer decide that he's... you know, I'm going to save 5 years' worth."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,988.647,998.55,"Production of a crop, use such saved seed in production of a crop shows that that's one way the saved seeds can be used, and I think that's the... that it helps limit the amount that can be sold."
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.55,1000.017,"--Only 1 year's crop, you're saying."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1000.017,1000.971,That can be sold.
1994.92-2038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1016.09,1021.743,"You're saying that there is no limitation on saving, the limitation is on save plus sell."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1021.743,1023.367,"--Saving by itself, without--"
1994.92-2038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1023.367,1031.396,"He can save as many seeds, either to plant himself or to sell for nonreproductive use."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1034.395,1035.159,--Yes.
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.179,1069.099,What... even though they have more acreage on that farm?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1069.099,1070.115,They have 800 acres.
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.129,1076.627,So the most they can save is enough for 800?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1076.627,1079.408,"For 800, because there's... they can't plant any more."
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1081.579,1083.875,Suppose they're thinking of buying the next farm.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1083.875,1098.947,"--If they buy... if they buy the next farm and at the time that they're saving the seed, at that point the saving is not a multiplication, but if that plan falls through and they don't have a farm, they can use as much saved seed as they need on their farm, and their farm is still 800 acres."
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.776,1140.633,"But if you go out of business after 1 year and you have 4 years' worth of seeds left, you're saying, tough luck, you can't do anything but eat it."
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1140.633,1141.351,"Well, no."
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.551,1148.005,"Oh, but--"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1154.518,1159.546,--You couldn't save more than would be needed for that farm.
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.265,1162.125,Four years worth of seed.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1162.327,1163.155,--Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.155,1164.843,--What do you do with tomato seeds--
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1164.843,1168.139,"They may... I mean, you can always get the authorization of the owner."
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.786,1199.984,"--Mr. Stanley, am I correct in assuming that the practical difference, at least in the soybean business and barring unforeseen contingencies, between your position and your opponent is that you say he can only sell 1/45th of the seed he produces, and he says he can sell up to a half?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1199.984,1201.468,Right.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.998,1205.045,In this particular--
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1205.045,1205.451,--the numbers involved in soybeans.
1994.92-2038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.451,1217.758,"--And then the second question, if you do have the time to address it before you finish is, could you tell me to what extent you think the court of appeals in its opinion relied, and presumably erroneously, on the sentence after the proviso that Congress has now deleted?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1217.758,1234.204,"I don't think the Federal Circuit relied on the second sentence, other than to come up with the construction of ""for seeding purposes"", which I think both parties are agreed modifies, obtained by... from the owner."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.895,1265.083,Let me ask you a question.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1276.844,1279.702,"The Federal Circuit's definition of ""marketing""--"
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1279.702,1287.791,"That would mean the farmer could do what, if we disagreed on the definition of ""marketing""?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1287.791,1292.415,"--The Federal Circuit's treatment of the term ""marketing"" in itself is erroneous."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.789,1298.194,How would that affect the outcome in this case at the bottom line?
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1298.194,1313.86,"--It would affect the amount of seed that could be sold, because the broader the definition of ""marketing"" to include all selling, if this Court concludes that selling includes all forms of selling, I think the answer comes up to be, you can sell no more than what would be needed to replenish your farm."
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.86,1328.603,"Why... if what Justice O'Connor supposes is correct, we disagree with them on marketing, why can't you win your case under 2541(3), that there was a sexual multiplication of novel varieties, a step in marketing, end of the case?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1328.603,1342.707,"That's what we have done here, but the question in this case is, they're claiming that they are under the exemption in 2543, and in order to determine the meaning of 2543, the scope of it, that's... they're claiming an exemption."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1343.801,1362.809,"Yes, but I'm just asking you, suppose we think that the CAFC was basically correct except insofar as erroneously defining marketing, what's the bottom line outcome here, if that's our view?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1362.809,1376.194,"--If marketing has a broader definition than what's at the Federal Circuit, the amount of seed that can be sold by a farmer is less than what the Federal Circuit held."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1376.866,1379.959,But more than what you say.
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1379.959,1396.188,"--The reason I'm having difficulty answering that question is, the Federal Circuit, by misconstruing the opening clause of the statute, their definition of marketing is basically out on its own, because it doesn't follow the structure of the statute, of the two references to 2541(3)."
1994.92-2038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1405.014,1424.989,"You really haven't answered my question, and if what we think is that the only error made below was in the definition of the term, ""marketing"", what do we do with this case, and how does it affect the outcome at the bottom line?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1424.989,1440.53,"I think that the answer to that, I think that at a minimum the case should be remanded at the Federal Circuit to determine that issue, and basically let them resort out the issue under a proper interpretation of ""marketing""."
1994.92-2038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.449,1456.618,"Even given the circuit's opinion and interpretation of the ""except"" clause in the first few lines of the statute?"
1994.92-2038,0,40499,richard_l_stanley,,1456.618,1459.82,"I think the Federal Circuit's interpretation of the ""except"" clause cannot stand any scrutiny at all."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1488.637,1497.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.92-2038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.273,1541.445,And you disagree with that.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1542.038,1542.803,--We certainly do.
1994.92-2038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.803,1546.755,"--that at a minimum, ""marketing"" is the larger term, and it includes selling."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1546.755,1547.537,That's correct.
1994.92-2038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1557.283,1566.108,"Do you agree with the CAFC except insofar as it defines marketing, or do you think it made other errors?"
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1566.108,1582.617,"Our disagreement is not limited to that point, but we... but I do want to emphasize that we think that the Federal Circuit was wrong on that point, and in this case, it's particularly clear that what respondents did violated subsection (3) of section 2541."
1994.92-2038,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.6,1589.193,"May I interrupt you, Mr. Seamon, to help me with one point?"
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1604.454,1609.872,"I'm not sure that that's right, because the Federal Circuit did make other errors."
1994.92-2038,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.872,1624.898,"They made other errors, but the result would be correct, if one read it that way, and I know you disagree with that reading, and it is kind of counterintuitive, but if you do construe ""marketing"" as to cover the universe other than brown bag sales, then I think the judgment should be affirmed."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1624.898,1629.27,"I believe that's correct, but I'd want to do more--"
1994.92-2038,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.27,1629.567,I understand.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1629.567,1633.722,--and I'll try to do that in the course of addressing the other errors that the Federal Circuit made.
1994.92-2038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.804,1664.99,Where are you reading now?

1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.439,1717.142,On his farm.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1717.142,1718.735,On the farm.
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.735,1722.546,What if he saves enough seed for 5 years' worth of crops?
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1722.546,1726.997,"We would rely in that case on the term, ""a crop"" to suggest that--"
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.997,1727.966,One season.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1727.966,1730.277,--what can be sold is one season's worth of crop.
1994.92-2038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1731.449,1736.899,"Do you agree that this is an academic question, because the seeds don't last for more than a year?"
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1736.899,1741.694,"--I think, Justice Ginsburg, it depends on the variety that you're speaking about."
1994.92-2038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.004,1749.613,"Unlike vegetables, which you can keep for 5 years, in some cases?"
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1749.613,1750.738,--That's my understanding.
1994.92-2038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1791.377,1794.798,"Well, they had violated it even before the sale, then, hadn't they?"
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1794.798,1808.043,"The production itself violated subsection (3), and I would go on to say that even though the proviso specifies that it operates without regard to subsection (3), all the proviso does is to authorize the sale."
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.164,1816.991,"Very cleverly drafted, it really is, isn't it."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1817.709,1821.537,I won't... I will concede the point.
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.877,1870.142,What about the second point?
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1880.216,1880.513,Yes.
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.513,1881.076,--Labeling.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1884.95,1886.214,That's correct.
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.214,1887.527,Is that in the case?
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1888.558,1890.057,It is in the case.
1994.92-2038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.256,1940.223,You say it is not?
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1940.223,1943.035,"--That notice is not required, that's correct."
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.489,1982.957,"Because that's too remote from selling, whereas notice is not too remote."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1993.671,2001.277,"Well, the... the exportation is, indeed, very remote from the act of selling, but what subsection (6) and the notice requirement--"
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.277,2001.542,Why?
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2004.479,2010.524,--There is a lot of force to petitioner's argument that sale is one thing and providing notice is another.
1994.92-2038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.531,2080.072,"This applies to all State laws, not just State laws regarding notice, so your argument really, if carried to its conclusion, would say all State laws are covered, but none of the things listed in 2541 are covered."
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2082.54,2085.367,It is true that it covers all State laws--
1994.92-2038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.367,2085.914,There was a question.
1994.92-2038,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2085.914,2095.581,--Most of the State laws governing the sale of seed have to do with the labeling in which... on which the seed is sold.
1994.92-2038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.581,2097.316,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2099.096,2103.736,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.541,2121.478,I don't know what you mean by that.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2122.289,2122.727,They had no--
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.727,2123.258,--just went out--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2123.258,2130.788,--purpose with respect to whether they would sell the seed later for reproductive or nonreproductive purposes.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.705,2142.705,--But can that be true?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2150.967,2156.809,"--Well, first of all, you can save seed for years and years, not just 1 year, certainly for 4 or 5 years."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.809,2157.587,Are you then disagreeing--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2157.587,2157.994,"Secondly, you can always--"
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2157.994,2168.616,"--Are you then disagreeing... not knowing much about farming, we were told by one person that the soybean seed spoils in a year or so."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2168.616,2169.272,--That's incorrect.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2169.272,2175.441,And you're saying it saves... you can save it and still retain its quality for how long?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2175.441,2175.956,That is correct.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2175.956,2176.956,For how long?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2176.956,2178.236,Four to five years.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.236,2179.252,Four to five years?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2179.252,2179.533,Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.093,2193.496,But is it not true that the amount of seeds they produced was far in excess of enough for a crop for four or five... far in excess of four or five crops?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2193.496,2194.34,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.34,2198.992,So then is it not patent that they had a purpose in mind that they would sell some of it to their neighbors?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2198.992,2203.57,"No, Your Honor, because they could sell all of their harvest for consumption purposes."
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.802,2216.831,"I just don't understand that answer, because you say they did produce enough seed they couldn't use it all for their own production, even in 4 or 5 years, and they didn't do it inadvertently, did they?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2218.783,2227.092,"--Justice Stevens, that ties in with the interpretation now propounded of this text by Asgrow."
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.9,2247.036,"Well, that may be, and it may not be controlling, but it just is clear, it seems to me, that they must have contemplated selling some of their seed at the time they planted this crop."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2247.036,2253.112,They contemplated selling their seed either for reproductive or nonreproductive purposes.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.112,2253.346,Right.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2253.346,2273.666,"The point is this, and it's a point that was broached by Justice O'Connor, in the Monsanto brief below, which invented this interpretation which is now adopted by Asgrow and presented before this Court, there are two premises that are necessary as a matter of textual analysis."
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2301.577,2309.09,They said you could save any amount but couldn't sell any amount for sexual multiplication purposes.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2309.09,2313.48,Their analysis requires that the term 1 bushel.
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.737,2330.487,You can--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2330.487,2331.159,--argument was adopted.
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.159,2336.188,"--You can sell seed to make oil out of, can't you, to be consumed?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2336.188,2336.75,Absolutely.
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.75,2337.672,But that's not reproductive.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2337.672,2345.747,"Absolutely, and let's assume that in our example 45 bushels of soybean are harvested."
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.73,2387.948,"Well, it now has been written out of the act."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2387.948,2390.932,"--It has been now by Congress, prospectively only."
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.932,2418.248,"Well, on your view, then, if a farmer made 51 percent of his income from growing melons, and he devoted the remainder of his farm to growing soybeans, he could be in the brown bag business with 100 percent of his soybean crop because he would still be predominantly in the business of... or the predominant source of his income would be that of farming rather than selling."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2418.248,2418.701,Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.087,2437.664,I'm puzzled.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2465.291,2466.635,50 percent or more.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2466.635,2468.244,So you were arguing 100 percent.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2468.244,2469.119,"No, we were not, Your Honor."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.119,2469.635,You weren't?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2469.635,2470.197,"No, Your Honor."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.197,2471.383,What were you arguing?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2471.383,2480.005,"First of all, we had agreed for purposes of the appeal that the primary farming occupation of the Winterboers, the test was satisfied."
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2498.247,2499.607,I thought... correct me on this.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2504.558,2505.401,That is correct--
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2505.401,2506.15,Is that correct?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2506.463,2508.306,--And I want to--
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2508.306,2515.819,"And was that your position from the beginning, so that you conceded even in the district court that you were in violation of the statute in part?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2515.819,2517.288,--It was never conceded.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.181,2546.603,Mr. Bode--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2546.603,2547.508,--according to the Federal Circuit test.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.508,2558.443,--I don't understand what you said just before we got into this discussion that under petitioner's interpretation the limitation to primary farming occupation is irrelevant.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2560.412,2574.094,"Because under petitioner's interpretation, only the most trivial amount of seed could be sold for reproductive purposes, in our example, just 1 bushel."
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.568,2603.488,"Only if... only if you apply that provision cropbycrop, rather than across the board."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2608.017,2608.346,I think--
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.346,2610.61,"--Go ahead, answer Justice Scalia's question."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2610.61,2611.173,--Justice... yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.349,2642.988,Where is the term primary farming occupation found in the statute?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2642.988,2668.04,"Your Honor, it's found in the proviso in the first section, and it says, provided without regard to section 2541, subsection (3), a farmer whose primary farming occupation is the growing of crops for nonreproductive purposes may sell to other farmers similarly situated for reproductive purposes."
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2668.04,2668.493,But he--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2680.91,2681.41,We--
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2681.41,2683.003,--for reproductive purposes?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2683.003,2693.047,"--Justice O'Connor, we accept the strict interpretation, the strict reading of the primary farming occupation test by the Federal Circuit."
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.683,2705.431,"Even under their reading, that definition would at least limit the class of eligible purchasers, though."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2708.882,2709.382,That is correct.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.589,2819.979,--You've lost me.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2824.851,2825.273,No.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.257,2826.662,Okay.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2826.662,2831.614,So the first sentence provides for sales by farmers for reproductive purposes.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.614,2831.864,Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2831.864,2834.395,And the second sentence provides for sales by--
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.395,2837.346,"A bona fide sale for other than reproductive purposes, that's the sentence you're--"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2837.346,2837.737,--For consumption.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2837.737,2841.329,--Mr. Bode--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2841.329,2845.78,"So we can see that as a matter of textual analysis, ""saved seed"" must include the whole harvest."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2845.78,2869.849,"--Mr. Bode, Judge Newman called this an ungainly statute, and I suppose that's a proposition that everyone would agree with, and if we are of the mind that there's more than one plausible reading to this statute, your way is plausible, Asgrow's way is plausible, the district court's way, how do we decide which is the one that Congress meant?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2869.849,2880.375,"Well, first of all, I would disagree, Justice Ginsburg, that Asgrow's interpretation is reasonable."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2884.327,2885.982,Then let's just stay with Judge Rader and Judge Newman.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2885.982,2886.654,I think that the--
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2886.654,2896.197,"If we think both of their interpretations are reasonable interpretations, interpretations that the words of this ungainly statute will bear, then how do we decide?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2896.197,2906.88,"--Justice Ginsburg, the unanimous Federal Circuit panel had a very straightforward and reasonable interpretation, and I think that's an interpretation that should commend itself to this Court."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2909.55,2912.737,That doesn't answer my question if we think they're both reasonable.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2913.69,2914.034,--I think--
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2914.034,2917.83,"--did divide 6 to 5 whether to hear this en banc, did they not?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2917.83,2925.888,"--I would suggest, then, that the... that this Court should defer to the Federal Circuit for other reasons."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2927.496,2942.209,"If we... to accept your position, must we say, Judge Newman's interpretation is wrong, that there is a right interpretation of the statute, and it's your interpretation?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2942.209,2954.579,"--I think you should defer to the Federal Circuit panel, Your Honor, because that is the interpretation that was understood by the farming industry for the last two decades."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.64,2974.415,"But if we should think that Judge Newman's interpretation is a plausible interpretation, then you say one thing we might take into account is what the farming community thought the statute meant."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,2975.196,2975.524,Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3028.831,3037.499,"Well, what do we do if we think that the Federal Circuit's definition of marketing was wrong, that it does include selling?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3037.499,3041.154,"I have two responses to that, Justice O'Connor."
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.188,3075.374,I don't understand your point.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3079.608,3082.434,"No, I don't."
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.012,3083.262,No?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3083.262,3100.707,"--without regard to these infringing acts, sales can be made, that you can make sales, if you're qualified, to another farmer for growing purposes without encroaching any right established by 2541, subsection (3), and that's marketing."
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.707,3101.519,That's despite.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3103.222,3107.626,But I think here's the... what the Federal Circuit did is very reasonable.
1994.92-2038,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3116.31,3121.903,"Well, I just asked you, what if we disagree with that, and I have not heard an answer."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3121.903,3122.682,--It has no consequence.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.037,3137.286,"Yes, but--"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3137.286,3138.349,--the farmer can make these sales.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.349,3149.203,"--that's assuming that the definition of 2541(3), right, which I'm not sure it does."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3149.203,3154.872,"It does not, and that's why the interpretation of the Federal Circuit was reasonable."
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.855,3260.596,"Mr. Bode, you made an argument a little earlier, I've been trying to figure it out, based on the sentence... I guess you say it's the second sentence, a bona fide sale for other than reproductive purposes made... I think you said that under the petitioner's interpretation that becomes redundant, was that your point, but why--"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3260.596,3261.016,That's our point.
1994.92-2038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.813,3263.968,--Why isn't it redundant under yours as well?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3282.914,3287.817,"--We concede that wording is superfluous, and it's an artifact of the--"
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3287.817,3288.411,Under anybody's interpretation.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3300.453,3301.719,--That is correct.
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3301.719,3305.983,So the equivalency you seek between the two sentences is absent.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3305.983,3320.914,"But as provided by the phrase, ""or for sales provided herein"", and in petitioner's brief, they concede before the Federal district court the saved seed encompasses seed sold under the second sentence."
1994.92-2038,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3320.914,3330.472,"Well, it encompasses, but is not limited to it, that's the point, and that was the point you were trying to make, and I think the argument fails because of the absence of that phrase in the second sentence."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3330.472,3350.418,"We disagree, again, because the specific phrase, or for sale as provided in that section, but more broadly, because of this problem... this problem, Justice Kennedy What is the farmer to do with the other 44 bushels?"
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.864,3366.989,"Well, that's not true with soybeans."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3367.442,3370.909,"--seed under the second sentence, he has to be relieved of many or most of the infringing acts."
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.909,3373.441,--He can sell them for soybean--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3373.441,3374.704,For soybean consumption.
1994.92-2038,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.704,3376.579,--May I ask you one--
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3388.824,3389.371,It is.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3406.41,3407.754,What is the difference in the price?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3417.767,3429.386,"The record here discloses that the Winterboers received approximately eight dollars and fifty cents 8.50 for their soybeans, whereas Asgrow was charging 15 to 16 dollars a bag."
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3429.386,3435.555,"But if they were selling it... if the Winterboers were selling it to sell to animals or for human consumption, what would be the price they would--"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3435.555,3438.257,Approximately 5 to 6 dollars a bag.
1994.92-2038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3438.257,3440.256,--So they get much more selling it as seed.
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3440.256,3449.425,They get essentially the amount which represents the labor added for the cleaning activity that's necessary prior to selling it for reproductive purposes.
1994.92-2038,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3466.652,3467.808,That's obtained by the authority language?
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3467.808,3468.152,--Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3485.363,3487.706,"Is the phrase you're focusing on ""obtained by authority""?"
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3487.706,3488.706,--Yes.
1994.92-2038,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3493.438,3494.423,"Oh, the last sentence."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3494.423,3496.406,--It's the phrase that states--
1994.92-2038,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3496.406,3499.03,"""A purchaser who diverts seed from such channels-- """

1994.92-2038,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3529.845,3532.454,"--Well, I'm not sure that that's so."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3537.625,3541.247,That's my point.
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.258,3557.883,"Thank you, Mr. Bode."
1994.92-2038,2,43825,william_h_bode,,3557.883,3558.716,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1994.92-2038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.716,3559.383,The case is submitted.
