1972.71-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.632,"First this morning in number 71-1082 Askew against the American Waterways Operators, Incorporated."
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,12.111,14.843,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.544,333.939,You mean without any shoreside damage?
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,333.939,336.239,"No, Your Honor we don’t mean without any shoreside damage."
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.239,341.627,"Well, then what about when there is no shoreside damage does the state have any business in the area?"
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,341.627,349.615,If there is no shoreside damage then the state may not have any interest in the area to protect.
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.474,369.444,Well you mean on those people who are making their living at sea like in fishing?
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,369.444,371.984,Mr. Justice White it certainly has an application there but it also has --
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.984,386.768,"Do you think, I just to ask you again does the State get any business providing the rule of liability for an oil spillage at sea that have no immediate impact shoreside?"
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,386.768,389.453,The State does not purport to have any responsibility --
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.453,391.013,So your answer is no?
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,391.013,391.664,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.664,392.988,Alright.
1972.71-1082,0,20752,daniel_s_dearing,,392.988,395.271,Our answer is no.
1972.71-1082,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,708.099,714.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1082,2,37136,nicholas_j_healy,,1570.436,1575.176,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.611,1675.914,"Mr. Healy, historically about when did the oil spill problem become a serious problem in navigation?"
1972.71-1082,2,37136,nicholas_j_healy,,1675.914,1681.626,"I would say, Your Honor about 1924 or a little before."
1972.71-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.306,1731.985,"But historically is there some correlation between the development of the very, very large tankers and greater incidents of oil spills?"
1972.71-1082,2,37136,nicholas_j_healy,,1731.985,1746.569,I don’t believe the size of the tankers has had much to do with it because there had been very few incidents of spills of large quantities of oil from large tankers.
1972.71-1082,3,34206,leroy_collins,,2489.358,2495.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1082,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2909.712,2919.707,"Well Governor, is it your position that the regulation of the State under the State Act is so pervasive that none of it can survive?"
1972.71-1082,3,34206,leroy_collins,,2919.707,2923.498,"Yes sir, that’s absolutely sir."
1972.71-1082,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3423.33,3426.204,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1972.71-1082,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3556.835,3563.073,"To have uniformity yield would mean overturning a long, long line of authority, would it not?"
1972.71-1082,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3563.073,3591.254,"No, Your Honor, I think not because the Jensen, Knickerbocker, and Dawson cases have all been very severely limited and this Court has never dealt with this emerging law particularly with regard to massive oil spills and uniformity has yielded in the past where there’s been an overriding state interest to protect and I don’t think it requires the overriding of the long line of cases."
1972.71-1082,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3591.254,3616.631,Is it conceivable that all of the coastal states had Acts of one kind to another that it might pass your inspection in Florida wherein they put in to Miami if they put in there in Pensacola but that they might not pass it Mobile or they might not pass it to other parts.
1972.71-1082,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3616.631,3625.152,"Well I think Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice you are now speaking to the argument that was raised as far as containment gear and inspection of the vessel or what type the gear it has on."
1972.71-1082,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.152,3626.547,"Equipment, generally."
1972.71-1082,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3626.547,3630.407,"Well, let me speak to that because I think that would be the test."
1972.71-1082,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3742.635,3743.455,Thank you gentlemen.
