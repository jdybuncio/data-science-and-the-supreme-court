1983.83-838,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.607,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Lorenzetti.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,47.388,51.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.555,293.21,What part of 8132 are you reading from?
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,293.21,302.925,"--Well, I'm referring to the language that... that talks about money or other property, and that... that comes within the first sentence."
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.002,305.893,That's quite a sentence.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,305.893,308.079,It is a long sentence.
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.079,308.548,Okay.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,311.172,311.641,Right.
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.652,329.149,"But it says ""in satisfaction of that liability""."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,338.77,345.408,"--Well, I think the legal liability to which it refers is the liability of the third party."
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.496,361.527,"Well, it's not clear, in any event."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,361.527,363.214,"Well, I... I--"
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.214,367.93,"I think you have to look at something else to determine the meaning of it, don't you?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,367.93,377.317,"--Well, I... I think that certainly on its face the statute does not in any way distinguish among the different sorts of damages you could have."
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.893,391.499,"Well, I guess you wouldn't say that recovery from a third party of property damage is going to be payable over to the United States."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,391.499,391.827,--No.
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.839,441.886,"Well, lost wages and medical expenses."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,441.886,463.83,"Well, that... that is how the benefits are measured, but in terms of what they are designed to replace or... or represent, that is the employee's exclusive remedy under the statutory scheme; that is, those benefits are designed to... to compensate the employee for any sort of personal injury."
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.343,472.404,FICA doesn't include pain and suffering.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,472.404,481.276,"Well... well, under FICA you... you receive benefits in place of any other damages you might get."
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.938,520.948,"But is FICA set up so that it includes not only elements for lost wages and medical expenses, but also some sort of element for what would be pain and suffering in a jury negligence trial?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,520.948,540.892,"There... no, there is no amount that you receive that is denominated pain and suffering; but when you look to the entire statutory scheme, the FICA benefits that... that are received by an employee in effect take the place of any sort of damages you might' otherwise recover against your employer."
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,540.892,544.079,"Well, I realize that's the case."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,571.38,572.63,"Well, no."
1983.83-838,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.191,620.127,"Well, nothing is recovered for pain and suffering."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,622.69,628.547,--There is no amount of FICA benefits that is measured according to someone's recovery for pain and suffering.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.017,820.111,May I ask a question right there?
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,834.263,838.932,"Well, the... the employee always gets the FICA benefits."
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.432,842.025,Right.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,849.148,853.365,"Well, depending on the situation, depending on how the numbers worked out--"
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.365,854.458,"Well... well, in this case."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,854.458,855.176,--No.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.566,859.566,No.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,862.891,863.547,That's correct.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.547,869.061,And out of that amount he had to reimburse the government for the wages and medical expense.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,869.061,869.889,That's correct.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.889,876.839,So that he is the one who ultimately bore the cost of the wages and medical expense in this case.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,876.839,882.962,"Well, of course... of course, he had received the FICA benefits before and was merely paying them back."
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.163,890.647,"Well, but--"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,890.647,891.834,--He may or may not get the bonus on top of that.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.066,901.313,"--Well, somebody had to pay the hospital bill to start with, and I assume he did."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,901.313,906.672,"Well, I think he may have and the government reimbursed him through the FICA benefits."
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.672,907.513,Right.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,924.46,932.644,"Well, in that that $8,500 was denominated pain and suffering and yes, part of that went to recompense the FICA benefits."
1983.83-838,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,935.362,943.313,"Does it also include loss of wages and special damages, other special damages... the third party--"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,943.313,954.277,"The third party recovery in this case we have agreed represents pain and suffering, and that is because of the unusual situation that's created by the Pennsylvania no-fault statute."
1983.83-838,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,954.277,958.354,"--Well, my question was addressed to the general proposition."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,971.692,974.565,In many cases that would be so.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.873,1030.012,"Well, as I said, I wasn't debating the fairness of it; but the net result of it is that he pays his own hospital bill."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1030.012,1033.355,"Well, I... it depends on... on--"
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.355,1034.073,If he had one.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1034.073,1038.04,--I mean you can... you can shift around the money however you want.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.04,1046.098,"Well, but it isn't shifting around, because the $8,500 I thought you stipulated none of that is attributable to either wages or... or medical expense."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1047.739,1049.426,"Well, we have accepted that."
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.426,1052.252,"And if we accept it, doesn't it follow he paid his own hospital bill?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1052.252,1054.267,One could regard it that way.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.424,1056.501,"Well, one must regard it, don't we?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1056.501,1064.764,--One could also say he came out with... with the medical expenses and the lost wages plus something on top of that as a result of the third party recovery.
1983.83-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.764,1068.574,"Well, but only if you say the $8,500 includes medical expenses and lost wages."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1072.37,1088.317,"Well, I suggest that... that Congress when it was structuring the federal compensation scheme was focusing on what was necessary to be fair to the employee to give him a recovery for a work-related injury, and that amount is measured by the FICA benefits."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.919,1109.215,"Well, Ms. Corwin, what would be the case if instead of $8,500 it was $1,500?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1109.215,1110.838,Then--
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1110.838,1113.509,Then what's his obligation to reimburse?
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1113.509,1119.553,--His obligation under the plain language of the statute is to reimburse the federal government for the FICA benefits.
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1119.553,1122.474,"Well, the whole $1,500--"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1122.474,1123.395,"The whole $1,600."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.395,1123.52,--All right.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1126.005,1127.255,Sixteen hundred was the FICA benefits.
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.255,1130.206,"Well, then, let me change that from $1,500 to $1,600."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1141.014,1142.827,"Well, I don't think so."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1143.778,1145.919,"Well, if he gave it back, he wouldn't have anything, would he?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1145.919,1155.383,"--He... well, he would come out with one-fifth, because in 1966 Congress provided that the employee would always get at least one-fifth of some third party recovery."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1155.383,1156.211,I see.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1156.211,1157.789,So the bottom line is--
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1157.789,1159.867,So... so he'd get $300 odd dollars or something.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1159.867,1160.32,"--Well, yes."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1164.224,1167.411,"He's paid the $1,600 hospital bill."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1167.411,1169.94,"Well, the government initially paid it."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1169.94,1170.425,Yes.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1182.92,1197.601,"Well, I think it's a matter of characterization, and I think that one has to start out from the premise that when Congress was setting up this federal compensation scheme that it felt that the... the proper result was that the employee should get FICA benefits."
1983.83-838,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1228.417,1232.587,"Well, if I were the injured employee, I'd still feel I was $1,300 out of pocket."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1232.587,1234.446,"Well, I think that--"
1983.83-838,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1234.446,1238.523,"Well, he has the compensation payments."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1239.835,1244.551,"--Well, that's right, and that really is the basis of the scheme."
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.01,1291.408,"Ms. Corwin, perhaps your opponent can speak with more authority than you can on this, but under the Pennsylvania statute, granted you can only sue for basically pain and suffering, but isn't there some administrative provision or some provision for your own carrier, your own insurance carrier to pay lost wages and specials?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1291.408,1300.496,There... the way the Pennsylvania scheme works would prevent in this situation no-fault being... benefits being paid.
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1316.147,1330.063,"So an employee of a private employer here who couldn't claim workmen's compensation could have claimed something from the first insurer, but because he was covered, this guy was covered by FICA, this person couldn't."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1330.063,1331.266,No.
1983.83-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.023,1362.362,"But if it's an injury not arising out of in the course of employment and there is no workmen's compensation, no FICA, then under Pennsylvania law the first liability carrier has to pay specials?"
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1362.362,1363.894,That is correct.
1983.83-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.657,1378.779,"Ms. Corwin, in a... in a state without no-fault or without some system like Pennsylvania's and you sue the third party, you can recover anything you can get out of them."
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1392.85,1394.256,"Well, that... that's correct."
1983.83-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.256,1396.958,I mean whether that's... whatever the recovery is.
1983.83-838,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1404.487,1410.985,"Well, it's not unique in that you may always end up having to pay everything back."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1734.936,1737.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.061,1856.559,"Well, that's what the statute seems to say."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1856.559,1869.055,"--Well, it says that, if Your Honor please, only if you interpret the word ""damages"" to mean damages for pain... for pain and suffering only."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.055,1872.444,"Well, isn't that what this usually refers to in a tort suit?"
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1872.444,1872.851,No.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.851,1876.77,What do you usually refer to recoveries for pain and suffering?
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1876.77,1879.878,"I interpret the word ""damages"" in the statute."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.732,1899.855,Including damages for pain and suffering.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1899.855,1900.682,And including property damage.
1983.83-838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.815,1931.78,"Well, but you say the reason why it's not reasonable is a reference to injury and death necessarily limits it to the kinds of injuries or damages you associate with personal injury rather than property damage."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,1931.78,1934.544,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that that's not exactly how the statute reads."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.694,1997.69,"Well, suppose this had come... come in a state without a no-fault, and he sued the third party, and he sued him for lost wages, medical expenses, pain and suffering."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2012.684,2023.493,"I would be making the same point I made in my brief, Your Honor, in that his third party recovery, whatever the jury found, that was his third party recovery, and that's his single recovery that he's entitled to the benefit of."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.456,2039.314,"Well, what's the answer to my question?"
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2048.482,2048.498,--No.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.498,2049.295,--Just happened to award--
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2049.295,2050.217,No.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.873,2052.184,--Damages only for pain and suffering.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2052.184,2053.699,--I would not be making the same argument.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.699,2054.153,Why not?
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2054.153,2054.699,He would be obligated to pay.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.699,2055.699,Why would he?
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2055.699,2064.07,Because his third party recovery for damages included the right to prove in that third party action his medical expenses and wage loss.
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.07,2064.601,Yes.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2064.601,2065.507,The fact that the jury didn't award--
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.507,2067.803,The only thing is... the only thing is he didn't prove any.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2067.803,2071.458,"--Well, the jury didn't find... might have found other reasons why not."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.579,2079.376,You're not impeaching it at all.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2091.527,2102.21,"Your Honor, I think that the purpose of the right of action that is brought which results in a man receiving a third party recovery--"
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.21,2111.3,So you think these... these cases ought to come out completely differently if they come out of Pennsylvania or other states with no-fault and states that don't have no-fault.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2111.3,2119.157,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that Congress decided to rest on state law, and we're not going to prohibit the states from experimenting with different types of recovery."
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.279,2133.231,"Well, not in terms of the obligation to repay the government."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2133.231,2136.697,"--Well, there might be no recovery in a given case because--"
1983.83-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.697,2142.789,"Well, maybe... that may well be, but... but in terms of his obligation to pay, I don't know... I don't see why you wouldn't--"
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2142.789,2150.301,--Because it results in him getting less than whatever the single recovery was that the state law contemplated that he would receive.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.325,2213.402,"--Mr. Sovel, can I ask you a question I just don't quite understand?"
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2221.978,2222.195,Right.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.195,2226.99,And he... I take it he would have had that paid out by the no-fault insurance carrier.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2226.99,2227.662,Correct.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.662,2230.769,Because he was not paid by any compensation program.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2238.064,2241.125,I didn't follow your last part.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.921,2246.373,"He brings the third party action and gets the $8,500 for pain and suffering."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2246.373,2246.873,Right.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.873,2254.434,"And he goes to his no-fault carrier and says I had to give part of that money back to the government, so I did not have it paid by the government."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2259.103,2262.68,Because in this situation there is no no-fault carrier.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.352,2265.866,There is no no-fault carrier?
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2265.866,2266.741,He was driving a government vehicle.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.731,2291.887,The no-fault insurance is paid by the driver himself.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2291.887,2292.465,--Yes.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.465,2293.215,He pays his own premium.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2293.215,2293.777,Right.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.777,2294.355,What if he was from Maryland?
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2297.604,2300.103,"Well, I'm not so sure I follow you question."
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.103,2308.523,"--Well, supposing he was not... not... does... say an out-of-state person, must he carry his own no-fault insurance, or he just has no right at all, is that it?"
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2308.523,2314.69,"Well, he would have his rights under what his policy would be, and if he received no no-fault benefits--"
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.69,2316.221,He's just out of luck.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2316.221,2316.8,--Then no.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.392,2332.714,"Well, then, why can't he now say I did not get any no-fault... I'm not getting... the net result of my arrangement with the government is I get nothing for my hospital bill, so I want to sue the third party."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2332.714,2339.962,"Because the no-fault carrier is entitled to say to him, in turn, you received compensation benefits, and we're entitled to the credit for that under Pennsylvania law."
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.962,2341.056,"But I received them, but I couldn't keep them."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2341.056,2342.102,"Well, but that--"
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.102,2343.524,I just wonder.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2345.179,2346.898,"--Well, that... that would really put you right around in a circle."
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.127,2363.563,"Well, as I understand your explanation of Pennsylvania law, it says that the third party has to pay the hospital bill when the plaintiff has to pay it himself."
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2367.607,2367.935,That's right.
1983.83-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.935,2370.075,So I would think he ought to be able to get it from the third party.
1983.83-838,1,20128,charles_sovel,,2375.51,2400.767,"Well, I... I think that for him to go back to his own carrier now, I don't see how he could do it in these circumstances, because the carrier would also have the right to say we're entitled to get the benefit of workmen's compensation, and therefore, there is no no-fault liability, and the state court would turn around and say that's a correct interpretation of our statute."
1983.83-838,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.688,2481.046,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Corwin?"
1983.83-838,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,2481.046,2485.201,Just one brief point.
1983.83-838,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.521,2509.865,"Thank you, counsel."
