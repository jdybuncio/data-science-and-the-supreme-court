1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,14.447,17.758,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,243.231,245.754,May -- may I ask you before you state the defense.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,252.531,253.601,"Well, it's a --"
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,253.601,256.687,-- remitted the arbitration or commented the arbitration?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,256.687,257.194,All right.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,278.841,279.507,Where is it?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,280.437,280.838,"Well, I'll read it."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,280.838,281.956,That is a subject matter of (Voice overlap) --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,281.956,293.726,(Voice Overlap) it -- it kind of reads backwards and I -- I will invert the -- the order in which it appears and we'll start at the beginning in attempt -- point of time and it's the second quoted paragraph.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,374.55,385.903,"There is, the arbitration with -- that the agreement would force an arbitration, matters which are strictly a function of management help."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,385.903,386.878,That is correct.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,386.878,393.725,"And needless to say grievance, a difference of opinion may arise as to what are matters strictly for the -- for the management."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,393.725,399.554,"Well, there are -- obviously, there are such differences and the question is under this language, “Who resolves those differences?”"
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,399.554,399.775,Yes.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,399.814,412.658,"And more importantly -- now I think we would say, and again I'm anticipating here, that I might as well get this clearly out as really the essential part of this argument."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,528.585,530.931,Meaning not covered by any other provision of the agreement.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,530.931,535.519,In which there is no claim that there is anything covered in the other provision of the agreement.

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,650.2,652.548,"I think that is our position, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,734.907,757.903,What is involved is a conflict of view unless it's ludicrous -- what it involves is a conflict of view whether there are provisions in the agreement that has been -- that limit the strict view or confinement because it's dealt within the come provisions explicitly or implicitly in the agreement.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,757.903,761.599,That's what -- that's what every grievance says.
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,768.4,771.837,"Well, that's -- that's true of every grievance as to the application of the contract."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,775.237,775.605,No.

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,775.908,781.168,-- when I -- I say every grievance I mean grievance and I should -- I've -- accustomed to speaking in U.S. -- to your language.
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,781.843,781.953,It's not true.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,781.953,782.419,-- of grievance --
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.419,782.563,In other words --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,782.563,784.822,-- as the complaint of violation of the agreement.

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,785.228,786.134,It's not true in every complaint where the --
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.134,788.467,It's not through the local trouble kind of grievance?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,788.467,788.879,No.
1959.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,949.796,952.419,What was that case again Mr. --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,952.419,959.908,"That is Timpken Roller Bearing Company v. N.L.R.B, 161 F.2d 949 we cited it in our brief though."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,959.908,962.201,And why was it arbitrable?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,962.201,971.187,"Because it involved, I said, the Court a question of the scope of management's rights as compared with the rights of the employees."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,983.082,1001.562,"Well, I should -- I should think of large percentages of the controversies for which there is a procedure to peaceful settlement, arises precisely on the question whether or not it's a matter of exclusive concern to the management or not."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1001.562,1001.645,Mr. --
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1001.645,1003.938,I should suppose those are almost the majority.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1004.178,1004.239,They're about --
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1004.239,1006.308,-- there is a good many large percentages --

1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1006.46,1007.897,-- to settle for that.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1007.897,1017.04,"I think this is correct that a large percentage of grievances involved areas in which management says, “Well, we're not restricted by the contract at all.”"
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1037.309,1040.539,(Inaudible)
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1040.539,1044.48,We had sought and I want to get to that and that's --
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1044.48,1045.486,(Inaudible)
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1045.486,1046.069,All right.
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1232.536,1233.89,Without violating this contract?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1233.89,1243.618,Without violating this contract so long as it uses that right in a way which doesn't violate some other provision in the agreement just as it has the right to lay off people.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1434.426,1453.31,Will you be good -- will you be good enough to read if you can the terms in which the grievance was formulated which was asked to go to arbitration in this case and then read the terms of the proposal which you made or a provision in the contract which -- which failed?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1453.31,1459.391,"Well, the grievance is found on page 104 of the record."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1459.391,1460.801,Wait a minute.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1461.809,1466.403,Yes.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1466.403,1467.915,All right.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1467.915,1471.997,And paragraph 3 of the Court's -- District Court's findings.

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1516.423,1518.805,If lockout is explicitly prohibited by the agreement.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1518.805,1526.674,"Now, read -- now if you will read what was proposed to the Company to be incorporated in the agreement and rejected?"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1526.674,1535.321,"Well, that unfortunately does not appear on the record, Your Honor but I can direct Your Honor's attention to the place within the transcript to which it's referred to and described."

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1540.401,1540.589,Yes.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1543.448,1547.032,You mean down -- the stenographic or this one?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1547.032,1547.127,In this one.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1547.127,1548.932,All right.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1548.932,1550.235,The hearing before the District Court.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1554.937,1555.516,"Yes, all right."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1555.516,1565.313,The Company in its defense offered really defenses which went to the merits of the grievance which we regard this whole question of the 1956 negotiation as going to the merits of the grievance.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1568.68,1570.03,Yes.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1570.03,1585.006,"And now, the witness in this case is Mr. McElroy who was a witness for the -- for the employer, Mr. Lang and I think can tell you who is -- what his function is."
1959.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1627.753,1629.225,The first one was the Company representative.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1629.225,1630.49,That was the Company representative --
1959.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1630.49,1630.799,Yes.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1630.799,1634.688,"-- in the negotiation, and this is now a union representative."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1687.077,1687.91,And --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1687.91,1698.914,"Now, the testimony follows in explanation and is asked, “Did we agree with the Company that the Company had the unrestricted right to contract out work in those negotiations?”"
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.594,1781.836,"Now, may I ask Mr. Feller."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1799.651,1800.088,That's right.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1800.088,1809.009,"This first paragraph, the introductory paragraph was properly before -- was properly before the District Court --"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1809.009,1809.289,That is correct.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1809.289,1810.805,-- with the interpretation.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1810.805,1817.533,"We -- we believe this paragraph, not the -- not the question of the management clause as to contracting out."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.09,1868.297,"Now, is it true that the position that in this instance in taking the testimony that what you did in considering the factors that he did that --"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1868.297,1868.534,We are --
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1868.534,1870.78,-- the judge overstepped?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1870.78,1873.523,"Oh, he -- he went into the question of contracting out."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.607,1939.544,"Well, I -- did this history of the contracting out clause, was that relevant to an interpretation on the first paragraph of that (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1939.544,1940.812,We do not think so.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1940.812,1949.871,"In other words, it's not relevant to a determination whether the grievance submitted involves strictly a function of any."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1949.871,1950.607,No.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.954,1997.41,"Well, now suppose however, the -- or what would your position be had the history of the contracting out clause been introduced for the purpose of establishing that the parties expressly considered strictly a function of management, that language of the arbitration clause when they were debating the contracting out clause?"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1997.41,2006.006,"Well, that's a -- in other words, if the evidence were introduced as evidence going to the proper meaning of strictly a function of management."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.006,2010.583,In relation specifically to contracting out.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2010.583,2018.921,"Well, that you might argue then that that evidence would be relevant as an aid in the construction of the terms “strictly a function of management.”"
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2018.965,2019.656,But the way it came in --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2019.656,2021.344,-- clause has been in here all the time.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2021.344,2030.66,"But the way, as I understand your position then, the evidence dealing with contracting out was submitted and relied upon here."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2034.431,2042.543,"Well, at least, it was not made the findings which I'd direct Your Honor's attention to which appear at particularly on page 105 on the record."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2042.543,2058.154,Justice Brennan's question would arise more -- more concretely if the grievance to which you call our attention on page 104 had been explicitly opened to be inserted in the agreement and reject it.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2058.154,2061.496,"In the arbitration clause, we've said that all questions of contracting out --"
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2061.496,2062.478,No.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2084.077,2084.138,That's right.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2084.138,2096.137,You make a claim here that to the extent that they exercise this contracting out in this case is a way of violating the no lock-out provision.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2096.137,2096.677,No lock-out provision --
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2096.677,2097.478,"Now, what I'm saying is --"

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2134.879,2137.755,I would say that that agreement was not admissible that --
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2137.755,2137.837,All I'm saying is that --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2137.837,2139.927,-- that this would not be admissible and irrelevant.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2139.927,2140.732,That isn't my question.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2150.587,2151.399,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2156.357,2158.026,I'm saying that's a different case from this.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2158.026,2158.439,"Oh, this."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2169.186,2180.342,"Well, you're saying the antecedent torts of proposal in a collective bargaining negotiation in with each side, is making proposals for this, that and the other reasons."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2193.168,2194.045,"Well, I'd go further."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2199.935,2201.03,"Well, that -- that isn't before us."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2201.979,2202.994,That's for the arbitrators.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2217.641,2220.568,"Whether it's incompetent, is the argument you have to make before the arbitrator --"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2220.568,2220.622,That's right.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2220.622,2221.632,-- and not before us.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2221.632,2236.478,"Here, we say it's irrelevant because nobody has asked this judge to find what he did, i.e. the contracting out as an inherent right of management which the union cannot claim, is limited by the agreement."

1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2259.132,2260.092,Yes.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2260.092,2260.353,I think --
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2260.353,2289.219,"But does not the fact that the union sought and the -- it and the employer bargained about including in the contract a covenant fact, no work would be contracted out but that this covenant was rejected, shed light upon the intention of the parties as to whether they intended such to be arbitrated?"
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2289.219,2290.633,"No, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2366.712,2367.486,Yes.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2368.265,2376.644,"No, this is not legislative history of the Judicial Code, this is legislative history on the substantive issue of whether management should contract out and how much and under what circumstances."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2376.644,2380.983,"Well let me see if I get -- if I get your position correctly, Mr. Feller."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2409.787,2410.824,That is -- that is right.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2410.824,2426.392,"And that any evidence the Court may receive, extrinsic evidence that bears upon the meaning to be given the arbitration clause may be received."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2439.852,2440.214,That is correct.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2440.214,2441.635,Is that it?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2441.635,2441.669,That's right.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.669,2454.504,"And that here when get into the evidence dealing with contracting out practices, they -- that was not evidence which bore upon what the parties meant when they wrote this arbitration clause."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2454.504,2457.386,"That is precisely correct, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.324,2510.659,"Mr. Feller, you told us that -- that what is crucial as the meaning of the arbitration clause."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2510.659,2511.196,That's right.
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.196,2517.865,And if this is a matter under which the District Court can and must rightfully go.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2536.329,2537.047,"Well, that was --"
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.047,2541.531,For example the -- the particular shift doesn't like their foreman because he --

1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2542.893,2543.376,-- I think that --
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.376,2544.762,-- (Voice Overlap) has an unpleasant personality.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2544.866,2544.907,I --
1959.443,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.907,2546.453,-- is that arbitrable or not?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2546.453,2548.114,I should think not.
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2559.012,2563.185,(Inaudible)
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2563.185,2563.815,"Well, now."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.681,2596.754,It's not in the proceeding?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2596.754,2598.39,"Now, if the union claims --"
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2598.39,2600.611,But it's subject to the three or four steps as to what --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2600.611,2601.225,Up to arbitration.
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2601.225,2602.431,Up to arbitration.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2602.431,2623.642,"But if the union claims that there is any obligation under the agreement for some reason not to have Joe Jones as the foreman or not the contract out, then that claim does not present a question which is strictly a function of management and that claim can go to the arbitrator, and the arbitrator is not to be at large."
1959.443,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2647.999,2656.059,(Inaudible) foreman's own jurisdiction?
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2656.059,2656.885,"No, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.531,2683.084,"Mr. Feller, I'm sure that the -- this is relevant here but as -- an instance to the clarity in expression in a collective bargaining agreement."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2683.084,2683.784,And if you will note --
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2683.784,2688.66,What its issues which conflict with any federal statute in its applications established by purposes --
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2688.66,2690.723,"I am puzzled over that, Your Honor."
1959.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2704.828,2705.868,"Well, I think it's irrelevant here."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2706.081,2708.259,"No, I don't think anybody relies on that language."
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2745.047,2755.435,"As you know, I always bristle or -- and (Inaudible) when people talk about the intent of the parties unless they mean that which has been compounded and formulated into the words of the doctrine."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2755.435,2756.799,That is precisely what I mean.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2756.799,2760.378,And all talk about intention let's loose a lot of hairs.
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2760.378,2760.915,That's right.
1959.443,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.019,2788.309,"And I think also you ought to have been, what shall I say, should have agreed to a considerable extent to adjust the import of Justice Whittaker's question as to how much under your claim is necessarily left to the arbitrator not to determine his jurisdiction, that's another mischievous word in this connection, but how much of the wording of the system is dependent upon the arbitral skilled worker."
1959.443,0,20827,david_e_feller,,2788.309,2793.502,"Oh, I -- I've misunderstood the question if -- if you thought I must answer."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3305.936,3312.838,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.162,3635.629,"What is the unit here, Mr. Lang?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3635.629,3643.419,"The unit is the -- the maintenance employees, mechanics and helpers and also certain harbor tug employees."
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3645.411,3648.736,Are there are shop employees or some of them on board the vessels or --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3648.736,3650.525,Some are aboard harbor tugs.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3667.038,3670.601,What's the size of the personnel?
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3670.601,3672.07,"Relatively small, sir."
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3698.651,3701.485,Is this the specialist concerns that you contract with?
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3701.485,3702.038,"I beg you pardon, sir?"
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3702.038,3704.503,Did you contracted out the specialist concerns to mean --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3704.503,3709.049,It's contracted out to ship repair yards in the immediate vicinity.
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3709.049,3709.213,They are express --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3709.213,3710.951,They are expressly joining.
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3869.607,3872.73,We can find something he said that supports all of this.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3872.73,3877.15,"Well, in this case, sir, he supports us almost right down to the last teeth."
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3877.15,3878.027,(Inaudible) supports --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3878.027,3878.401,[Laughs]
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3878.401,3883.734,"-- you with, Justice Frankfurter had him on one opinion, I had him on another."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3883.734,3899.751,"But this Court and Professor Cox both have said on occasion that the mere fact that this is a labor agreement, which we're interpreting here, doesn't mean that we have to abandon all the principles which we have followed in all these years in the interpretation of labor agreements."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3899.751,3901.579,I hope we can all agree on that.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,3902.764,3906.1,"Yes, sir."

1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4300.505,4301.828,[Laughs]
1959.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4301.828,4302.647,-- glad to know that.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4305.434,4308.927,I came to the case long after the contract was negotiated.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4450.594,4452.772,"Mr. Lang, may I ask you a question at this point."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4452.772,4453.171,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4453.171,4471.176,"Put to one side for the moment the case that you have, namely where you place reliance on what were preexisting conditions determining or -- or indicating what management rights are at this case?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4471.176,4472.429,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4472.429,4487.358,"Suppose you had no such antecedent arrangements, antecedent efforts to put something in on the part of union, resisted by the management and now -- and in drawing the inference you do."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4515.39,4517.462,"Sir, I would not give 10 cents --"
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4517.462,4518.659,I don't mean cover the universe --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4518.659,4522.8,I would not give 10 cents for my chances in a case of that kind.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4541.844,4552.69,"And the reason being that in order to determine what I might call a threshold jurisdictional question, he would have to decide the merits of what is or what is not strictly management, wouldn't he?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4552.69,4572.906,"No, sir, not necessarily because I think in that case, you would have something more closer to the U.S. (Inaudible) case which is pending before Your Honors on application for certiorari where there was not any negotiation history and where there was actually a grievance filed in -- in the prior history."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4587.244,4600.079,"Well, its -- my question was that if you had that naked situation and if he did not allow it to go to arbitration, he would in effect, in fact, deciding the merits of what is a management, wouldn't he?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4603.489,4604.794,"Well, I think --"
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4604.794,4605.173,Why do you say --
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4605.173,4606.0,-- that that's correct.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4606.0,4606.359,Yes.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4606.359,4609.347,I think that's correct but for this reason --
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4609.347,4610.581,I'm not saying that it's this case.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4610.94,4611.295,"No, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4620.694,4624.888,"I understand that, but -- but if there is a threshold question to jurisdiction --"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4624.888,4625.045,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4625.045,4628.167,-- that goes to you that much of used terms?
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4655.538,4659.653,That he had nothing more in the contract or nothing more before him except --
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4659.653,4662.386,Except the contract in all its details.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4662.386,4663.736,-- which would be exactly like ours.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4663.736,4664.462,Yes.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4664.462,4671.964,"Then -- and he decides it was not arbitrable, he would have to pass upon the management rights clause if he relied up on that --"
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4671.964,4672.758,Yes.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4672.758,4682.19,-- purely and simply in his interpretation of that provision without reference to anything the parties had indicated to be their intent.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4869.172,4885.149,"What do you say, Mr. Lang, to Mr. Feller's contention that what the union tried to get into the argument was to put it a mildly, a much broader provision than they claim they now make for submission to arbitration?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4885.149,4889.463,"I think that is a distinction without a difference, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4922.29,4931.655,That brings me to remarks you made a minute ago -- the comments made a minute ago about the sensitiveness to management -- of management against the arbitration.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4959.725,4960.247,Well --
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4960.247,4960.442,Would you care to say something about that?
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4960.442,4978.17,"You'll have to ask -- you have ask me a double question, sir and I'd have to answer in two parts.First of all, I have never heard anyone say anything but the kindest and most praiseworthy things of the Dean Shulman, Mr. Cole and -- and some of the others who had national statute."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4978.17,4987.49,"I do know that for years, he tried to be released from the umpiring, the arbitration under the arbitration scheme, has been fought for years."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4991.238,4991.684,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4991.684,4993.156,I mean the union approached this but --.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4993.156,4993.842,"Yes sir, I -- and I --"
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4993.842,4996.703,But you don't happen to know that experience in detail.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,4996.703,5000.864,"And -- and I know that's true, that -- that to be true, a good many other arbitrators too."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5068.471,5070.265,"Litigants don't like to lose, do they?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5070.265,5071.067,"That's right, sir."
1959.443,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5075.983,5081.994,Maybe that system is precisely ones for views in connection with some (Inaudible) bad essence.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5081.994,5084.524,It's not bad if the right one is decided for me.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5829.252,5831.476,"Mr. Lang, may I ask this question."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5841.151,5842.578,And subsequent to it.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5842.578,5853.941,"In this case, the clause in controversy or the claim in controversy was reduced in writing, there was a document which adds for the inclusion of a particular clause, is that right?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5853.941,5855.078,The proposal?
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5855.078,5855.478,"Proposal, yes."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5855.478,5856.15,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5856.15,5857.338,And rejected.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5870.65,5874.85,I do draw the distinction for this reason.
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5903.725,5909.756,"Well, might not -- might not the proposal be made by the chief negotiator for the union by way of mouth."
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5910.36,5911.577,"Well, I don't -- no, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5916.717,5917.607,The written one.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5917.607,5917.944,"No, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5918.954,5934.332,"So that an -- an -- it would be consonant with your argument that evidence by witnesses as to what was proposed and what they rejected and so on, without any documentary proofs would, come within your adoption, wouldn't it?"
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5934.332,5936.545,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5936.545,5937.531,I just want to be sure.
1959.443,1,41689,samuel_lang,,5937.531,5944.221,"Yes, sir."
1959.443,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6050.413,6052.388,Mr. Feller.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6052.388,6056.958,"I will take, the Court's permission only a minute."
1959.443,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6077.32,6078.721,Is it in your brief?
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6078.721,6087.539,"It's not are in our brief, Your Honor Its in 172 F. Supp. 354."
1959.443,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6116.623,6118.613,"What kind of a no-strike clause was there, if any?"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6118.613,6124.573,"Well, it's not explicit, but it is quite clear that the decision came about and this is not uncommon."
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6135.927,6136.863,Is strikable.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6136.863,6138.081,Strikable.
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6187.488,6203.692,"So what he -- what he said in effect is, the course of the negotiation, legally amounted to writing in to the contract, rejection of your claim that that farming out stuff gives rise to grievance."
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6203.692,6207.133,"Well, that's -- it goes to the merits, gives rise to a grievance."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6207.141,6210.788,So if -- if that were -- if that were in the contract --
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6210.788,6211.975,If the contract said that there is no --
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6211.975,6212.4,If the contract (Voice Overlap) --
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6212.4,6213.631,-- grievance shall be processed.
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6213.631,6223.821,"No, because the contract says that farming out, or what do you call this -- contracting out, is a strictly managerial function."
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6230.514,6231.043,"Oh, yes, sir."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6231.529,6232.497,"But, you would --"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6232.497,6242.717,"We would come in -- on that case, we would -- that would be a very telling contractual provision on the merits of whether there was a limitation on the management function."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6242.717,6249.757,"No, but it said specifically that there's a clause now saying strictly -- strict functions of management or whatever it is."
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6254.783,6257.613,"Is this on the arbitration clause, (Voice Overlap) the famous machinery clause?"
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6268.494,6269.945,Suppose -- suppose all it was (Voice Overlap) --
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6269.945,6270.101,We -- I know --
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6270.101,6270.897,Or by such clause.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6274.544,6275.238,Or dealing -- it's not very --
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6275.238,6278.361,-- (which shall include contracting out).
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6278.361,6279.121,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6281.727,6283.273,Then -- then it would -- then it'd be -- it would not be arbitrable.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6283.273,6284.865,"Oh, oh, they have clear this, is not to be arbitrable."
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6284.865,6285.292,That's what -- I think that's --
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6285.292,6286.589,Because it says it isn't arbitrable.
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6286.589,6287.389,That's Mr. Lang's --
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6287.389,6288.245,That's his argument.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6288.245,6290.534,"Well, then -- but that is not what -- that's his argument here."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6293.862,6295.554,The man has a chance to going with it.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6295.554,6296.473,"I think so, Your Honor."
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6299.469,6299.9,"Well, I suggest you would find grief --"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6299.9,6301.282,-- my argument here.
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6301.282,6304.243,-- indicates it should have since you went through his whole brief.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6304.243,6321.613,"No, I -- I would -- I would claim -- I'll admit to having grown or confessed to having grown but we have never contended in this Court, in our original brief or in our reply brief that the arbitrator in this kind of cases has jurisdiction to interpret the arbitration clause."
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6322.162,6322.541,"Well, at least --"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6322.541,6322.895,-- for such --
1959.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6322.895,6325.994,"-- (Voice Overlap) explicitly stated, that position explicitly stated and we will try to --"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6325.994,6326.855,It's more explicit.
1959.443,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6334.441,6335.307,You may take a minute.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6336.267,6345.175,"On this -- Mr. Lang said that the wide-open clause, so-called, as the common -- as a common clause industry.I have no -- practically no agreement."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6441.718,6444.046,May I ask you this before you sit down?
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6455.367,6457.492,"We did, but the --"
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6457.492,6458.06,"Well, you didn't."
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6458.06,6462.813,"If Your Honor please, when I started my argument, I said the answer, if you remember?"
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6470.476,6472.285,"Yes, but to you, all that is irrelevant?"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6472.285,6472.966,That's right.
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6474.789,6476.383,Yes.
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6476.383,6478.357,And the District Court overruled our motion to strike.
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6478.357,6482.112,"Well, I just want to know why you didn't ask summary judgment, nevertheless."
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6482.112,6484.903,"Well, we moved for preliminary injunction which was the same thing."
1959.443,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6526.669,6535.163,"On your, theory you could stood that on your complaint and not offer any evidence until Mr. Lang offered his memory book, is that right?"
1959.443,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6535.163,6542.996,I think so.
