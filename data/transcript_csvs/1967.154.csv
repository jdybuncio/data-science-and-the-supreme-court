1967.154,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.938,"Number 154, Lucille Miller, petitioner versus California."
1967.154,0,34195,lee_bailey,,10.153,13.059,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.154,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,142.538,144.616,"They, by they you mean who?"
1967.154,0,34195,lee_bailey,,144.616,155.134,Several counsel for petitioner -- counsel being unable to remain awake 24 hours must have some of his colleagues to assist him in the watch and protect the petitioner.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1368.811,1379.889,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1423.605,1426.41,May I ask where your letter is?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1428.801,1431.117,The letter is not part of the record.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1440.506,1443.477,Is it then one of the briefs.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1443.477,1453.612,Only that certain sentence is in the brief of petitioner.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1453.612,1454.599,Where?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1454.599,1457.511,Page 13.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1601.765,1605.339,And she was also thereafter.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1605.339,1608.606,She was not sure what day she left.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1621.253,1632.544,"If it's possible that she was there after the complaint, can't we assume that she was, she was an experienced policewoman?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1635.956,1639.69,"She was not an experienced policewoman, she was an undercover agent."
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.179,1640.347,Oh!
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1642.808,1646.807,She had -- she had been used on prior occasions.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1656.066,1658.351,Could we assume that this was our first case?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1658.351,1660.079,It could be except that she had worked with narcotics.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.079,1663.022,Can it also be assumed that it was in a hundred cases?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1663.022,1670.593,"Yes, she had worked narcotics undercover (Voice Overlap) in narcotics."
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1670.593,1671.971,She's professional.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1681.912,1685.286,"As a narcotics undercover agent, yes."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1727.011,1728.733,Do you know where that letter is?
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.99,1738.262,"Page 13.13, excuse me for interrupting you."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1738.262,1739.802,Just a brief quote for that letter.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.322,1807.116,What is the precise constitutional violation which you seem to concede this -- at least some of this state conduct represents?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1807.116,1813.375,"If the statements had been elicited by this type of procedure, this would be a --"
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.375,1824.44,"If he had sat -- if she had come in there and sat down and start asking the defendant questions and elicited answers, what violation would it be?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1824.44,1826.859,This would be a violation of Miranda.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.859,1828.95,Of Miranda -- you mean that's the today.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1828.95,1831.35,Before the indictment -- today.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.43,1832.781,"Well, what was it then?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1832.781,1833.464,This case --
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.464,1834.236,What was it then?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1837.276,1844.04,"Well, at that time, it would not have been violation because of the peculiar circumstances of the case."
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.04,1847.802,"Well, there's been a violation to California law, wasn't it?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1847.802,1855.012,At Cali -- in California the first Dorado was decided in August of that year and had included the --
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.012,1858.233,And that was the reading -- that was the state court's reading of Escobedo.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1858.233,1860.8,That's correct Your Honor.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.556,1868.549,Do you think that conduct was a violation at the time of Massiah?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1868.549,1869.145,No.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.145,1872.303,Why not?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1872.303,1879.828,"Well, assuming -- assuming that there had been a charge in pleading, it might have been."
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.828,1882.971,"A charge, you mean an indictment or a charge?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1882.971,1884.895,An indictment.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.895,1886.498,"There were both here, wasn't there?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1890.464,1895.416,"Yes, the charge was in the municipal court in form of a complaint."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1919.861,1932.471,"You wouldn't distinguish Massiah and California on the grounds that there was no indictment, would you?"
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1939.332,1942.106,Yeah.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1942.106,1944.384,Although -- we have no California decision.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.237,1970.111,"Well, Mr. Griffin, she did have counsel actually in the jail."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1970.78,1972.463,That's correct.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.463,1984.138,"And despite that fact, the undercover agent was put in for the expressed purpose of evading that law here."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1984.138,1985.047,That is correct.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.047,1986.045,Is that correct?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1986.045,1986.968,That's correct.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.968,1992.357,And there's no way under the sun you can justify under Massiah or any other cases and opinion.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,1992.357,1993.964,I -- no.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.344,2007.657,"Well, how can you justify using those statements of trial deliberately?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2007.657,2015.789,Had the record -- have there been a proper objection and development at this point of the time to show that this undercover agent had elicited these statements.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.789,2025.331,Didn't one -- didn't the prosecutor attorney have a duty not to use that type of test work?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2033.349,2042.257,"At the time that the prosecutor introduced this evidence Your Honor, he was under the impression that this witness had not done any interrogation of the petitioner."
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2048.275,2052.291,"Well, will a listening post be legal?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2056.59,2057.54,Yes.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.54,2057.655,Oh!
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2059.46,2064.554,"At the time this was decided, there was no privacy in a jail cell."
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.215,2076.426,"Even with a lawyer outside, doing as much as he can to ensure privacy, you could go beyond that and bug the cell and use it."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2076.426,2084.349,We could place an agent in the jail cell section to overhear anything said by the petitioner.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.349,2085.404,And use it.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2085.404,2086.768,And use it.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.053,2103.953,Then your whole point is that this was all voluntary and spontaneous.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2103.953,2109.252,"My whole point is that on this record, Your Honor, we have no way of knowing that there was any elicitation of these statements."
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.252,2112.754,"Well, there was a discussion, was there not?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2112.754,2115.22,There's no showing that there was a discussion when these statements were brought out.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.22,2126.576,"Can I assume that a woman in her cell over a week will say something, will hold the conversation on something."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2128.144,2137.453,"We can assume that there was a conversation, Your Honor, but now the point is whether there is a duty upon the part of the defense to establish a record showing this conversation."
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.772,2146.226,Do you think there was a duty on the part of Ms. Fisk to say she was an agent?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2146.226,2155.896,Not if she didn't interrogate the petitioner; if she sat there silently and listened as she was have been instructed to do.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2167.196,2171.847,Did you say -- did you say she made daily reports to the sheriff?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2171.847,2174.616,She made periodic reports.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2177.004,2180.076,Are those -- are those reports in the record?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2180.076,2181.817,"No, they are not, Your Honor."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2181.817,2196.267,Is there any evidence to the fact that she did give certain information to this woman about the publicity and so forth and about blowing the top -- Hayton blowing his top.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2199.417,2201.603,There's no showing that this was in her report.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2201.603,2202.348,I beg your pardon.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2202.348,2205.174,There was no showing that this was in her report.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2205.174,2208.453,Is it in her report?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2208.453,2222.978,I've never seen her report and there's no -- and there's nothing in the record as to her written reports but what is in the record is the fact that these reports were available to defense counsel before the witness was called to the stand and--
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.978,2229.842,The prosecutor -- the prosecutor have no -- knew nothing about that you say?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2229.842,2235.109,The prosecutor has had the report obviously but that point is we don't know what was in that report.
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.244,2315.149,Is that by virtue of the rules in California that he had a right to interview the witness?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2315.149,2321.956,"Yes, he was entitled to -- he was promised an opportunity by the district attorney to interview this witness."
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.956,2327.741,"But the district attorney was under an obligation to let him do that, wasn't he?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2331.066,2337.201,"No, there would have been no duty on the part of the prosecution to permit that the prosecution witness to be interviewed."
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.81,2493.161,Going back on what you told us that the -- on the morning that the witness Fisk actually began to testify that it's clear that the counsel would have been given an opportunity to object out of the presence of the jury.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2519.132,2524.527,This statement as I indicated was made by the Court that he did indicate an objection that would have to be made in the presence of the jury.
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.527,2525.347,That's to the jury.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2525.347,2541.918,"I'm talking about an examination of this witness outside the presence of the jury to lay the foundation that there was a violation, and once that foundation was laid, it is problematic on whether the judge would have required the witness to resume the stand in the presence of the jury merely for the formality of an objection."
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.009,2590.639,Did Fisk testify to that?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2590.639,2592.672,"I don't understand your question, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.672,2603.868,"If Fisk testified that the defendant told her, Fisk that the defendant had given up all hope of marrying Hayton."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2603.868,2604.751,No.
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.492,2670.571,What happened?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2674.161,2675.02,"Well, the point was she could still maintain --"
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.02,2684.45,I suppose the undercover testimony in fact testified that the defendant had confessed of course then that would have been -- it could have formed a testimony of that but that doesn't.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2684.45,2695.89,True but the point is she could have -- she could have testified that she still love Arthwell Hayton but that she had given up any idea of ever marrying him because he was no good which is one of her statements.
1967.154,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2697.19,2699.741,I don't quite see your point.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2699.741,2715.822,My point is that -- that the petitioner's testimony followed that of the undercover agent so that -- and the only use that was made of the prosecution was to show this one difference in her testimony without of the undercover agent.
1967.154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.775,2751.296,"Mr. Griffin, suppose the agent, not this case but in another case, told the defense counsel, ""I'm going to testify that your client convinced me he was innocent."""
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2766.069,2784.698,Perhaps.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2784.698,2810.33,I understand you to say that with your opinion that this conduct of putting this woman in the cell with her at that time and then using the testimony she got from her without any warning of any kind is not misconduct.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2810.33,2818.967,"No, I have maintained that my argument is strictly based upon the inadequate record in this case."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2870.482,2881.735,Did this woman -- didn't this woman admit that she have told the petitioner that Hayton have blown the lead off the case?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2881.735,2885.244,"No, this statement was never made to the petitioner according to the record."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2892.975,2894.946,The witness never admitted it?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2894.946,2895.207,No.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2899.642,2906.644,I understood Mr. -- I understood Mr. Bailey have said she had at that time and make a statement that --
1967.154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.644,2925.151,(Inaudible)
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2925.151,2925.811,"Well, I'm sorry."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2932.032,2938.558,"She said, getting back to the Miller case, Arthwell Hayton came in and blew the top off the case."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2938.558,2938.91,"Yes, that's true."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2938.91,2940.038,She admitted telling her that?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2940.038,2941.068,"Yes, she said that."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2941.068,2942.594,"That was a lie, wasn't it?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2942.594,2943.235,Yes.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2960.713,2966.443,What does the State of California do with respect to a situation like this?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,2993.842,3005.117,The State of California has a long list of decisions in which they made a distinction between confessions and admissions.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3065.2,3068.59,May I ask you from my own information.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3080.592,3081.284,As soon as this decision --
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3081.284,3084.519,"In your office, can they do a sort of thing?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3084.519,3129.926,"No, our office in conformity with the decisions as they have come down from this Court and from the California appellate courts, promulgates rules of police, recommended rules of police procedure through the various district attorney's offices throughout the state whereby we recommend the police procedures and under the circumstances of this case and the Arguello case, it has been recommended that there would be no direct confrontation in jail cells between undercover agents and prisoners because of the fact that there is undoubtedly going to the conversation and that incriminating statements might be elicited."
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3135.862,3171.904,I asked that -- may I ask because I suppose your theory is at the presence of a person in the cell with the person who is on the charge of having committed a crime is in itself an inducement to speak even though the undercover agent in the cell doesn't volunteer a thing that the very presence may be an inducement to the other person to speak and I suppose the subject that most contends interest to the arrested person is his own wife.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3171.904,3189.572,As this -- the danger of eliciting a statement is present there whether the actual presence of another person would have -- would be a process of interrogation having a tendency if you elicit incriminating statements.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3193.225,3198.087,May I ask you one other question?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3219.362,3219.818,No.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3235.956,3241.136,And frankly there's something in effect that I would object to it or will object to it or something like that?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3241.136,3242.061,No.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3295.928,3296.244,I see.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3301.195,3303.868,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3303.868,3344.569,"Mr. Griffin, I still can't understand how you can argue to us, that this conduct on the part of the State was proper and should not be condemned by this Court after you have written a letter with just -- within a less -- less than a year ago in which you said, the respondent did not argue and does not now advocate the conduct to the sheriff and the undercover agent is set out of page 6 of petitioner's reply brief was proper and not unconstitutional."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3362.309,3367.346,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- when I refer to these various things --"
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3367.346,3367.872,I beg your pardon.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3367.872,3378.468,"When I refer to this various things that the undercover agent had brought to the attention of petitioner, in my argument today, I said that this was improper."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3432.365,3449.103,But I'm not talking about the procedure or the manner in which she came in to the case but I haven't heard anything from you to the effect that the conduct of a sheriff was unconstitutional and that you go on record as condemning it.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3457.594,3459.26,Sending up a newspaper.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3459.26,3459.773,I beg your pardon.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3459.773,3464.062,Sending up a newspaper clipping with the undercover agent.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3470.9,3485.76,"And I thought your position on that was that though this woman was just sent in there by the sheriff to listen, not to talk or not to elucidate any information from the petitioner."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3488.28,3493.735,That would be set in to elicit a statement of course for initial instructions.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3493.735,3501.263,With what you said before that her instructions were not to ask anything but just to listen.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3501.263,3506.007,Those were her initial instructions when she was placed in the jail cell and that was her testimony.
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3581.511,3584.189,Why did you write this letter to the clerk of the Court?
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3584.189,3613.964,"It was in response to a charge that the Attorney General of the State of California condoned this conduct and I felt that I had to answer that in a letter because the Attorney General's office did not in anyway should have ever perform ever condone this conduct that's why I wrote the letter to this Court in answer to that charge alone, that there was any condemnation on the part of the Attorney General's office as to what the undercover agent had done."
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3626.212,3636.545,"What you're saying is that if proper objection had been made, the alleged error that now exists in this record could have been avoided."
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3636.545,3637.553,That is correct Your Honor.
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3637.553,3657.338,And you're not suggesting one way or the other that this was deliberately induced error or not but what you're saying is that objection was not made and therefore the state was deprived an opportunity to avoid this alleged error.
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3657.338,3677.322,"It's our position that it's an imposition upon this Court for defense counsel to have deliberately acquiesce in the introduction of this evidence, have used it in both argument in this part of its defense and then come to this Court and ask the case to be reversed."
1967.154,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3677.322,3685.455,"I think you should say in view of all this that Mr. Bailey was not defense counsel at the trial, was he?"
1967.154,1,37921,philip_c_griffin,,3685.455,3691.006,"No, he was not."
1967.154,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3691.006,3692.863,"Very well, Mr. Griffin."
1967.154,2,34195,lee_bailey,,3694.67,3697.608,May it please the Court.
