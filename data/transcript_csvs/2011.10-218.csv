2011.10-218,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.95,"We will hear argument next today in Case 10-218, PPL Montana v. Montana."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.245,9.761,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.955,73.7,"Well, is your point that there should be a Federal rule of -- of laches or estoppel, or are you just building up to the fact that this is traditional, well recognized doctrine and there's been -- and there's been a sudden change?"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,73.7,75.447,"--That's exactly where I was going, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-218,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,121.15,129.081,"On the issue of whether we should look to the segments or to the river as a whole, what authorities can we consult?"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,152.789,154.65,"Well, I -- I mean, it's close to the end of the trail."
2011.10-218,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,194.176,207.407,"All of this, I take it, derives from the rule that preexisted -- preexisted the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign owned the navigable rivers within its borders."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,213.81,217.764,"There really isn't, Justice Alito, because we get our common law from England."
2011.10-218,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,232.348,240.502,"So what -- what is the origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the navigable rivers or parts of the rivers, but not the parts that weren't."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,242.892,243.516,Sure.
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.609,329.606,"Could you define ""de minimis"" for me?"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,329.606,333.997,"Well, I -- I'm -- I'm happy to try, but I think -- I'm not going to give you--"
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,333.997,337.869,"If we can't, some guidance or limit that we set for--"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,337.869,343.259,"--I've thought about this a lot, Justice Sotomayor, and I'm not here to give you a sound bite that's a bright-line definition of ""de minimis""."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.316,438.031,--I know you've told me that you think Montello is not pertinent because it involved a different issue.
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,500.911,501.569,Right.
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.569,507.863,So why isn't that a factor in the de minimis issue?
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,507.863,509.423,"Well, I mean--"
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,509.423,511.33,If there were a history here.
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,511.33,517.328,"--Sure, but, Justice Sotomayor, I think -- I mean, there are sort of two portages that are floating around in The Montello and I think it's important to distinguish between the two."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,522.967,524.764,"There was a canal in there, wasn't there?"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,524.764,525.606,"Well, afterwards."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.167,564.949,"But in The Montello, get they took the cargo off some boats--"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,564.949,566.104,"Oh, absolutely."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.104,570.884,--and moved it overland to another spot before they put it back on the boat.
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,570.884,586.689,"Sure, but my understanding of what was going on there, and maybe I misunderstood it, but I understand what they are talking about there is a portage where you take the cargo out of the boat in order to lighten the draft of the boat so it's not sitting as deeply in the river, and that allows the lighter boat to be carried over the--"
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.689,593.919,"We can both look at the opinion, but I think there is one spot where the court says that in some areas they had to change boats."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,593.919,601.136,"--Well, and that may be, but, I mean, again, I don't think we are talking about anything like the distances that we are talking here, and also--"
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.136,627.266,"I don't disagree with you, but what I'm asking is, if we had a history of navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of these rivers, and I'm not a sailor so my terms -- the cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other mode to another spot and picked up again."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,648.711,651.724,"--Well, sure, because these are all matters of degree, and those would be two different cases."
2011.10-218,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,673.995,683.115,"Even if it demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of commerce as being along the river."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,683.115,684.426,--Well I don't--
2011.10-218,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.426,692.907,"The sort of the case or analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from Washington to Tokyo, and someone says,"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,728.502,730.721,"--Two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-218,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,787.088,789.12,I don't see why portage is relevant at all.
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,823.978,832.007,"Well, I'm with you on that, Justice Alito, and I think logically if you think what's the highway of commerce here, if there was this 18-mile overland portage rout, that would be the highway of commerce."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,865.679,865.87,17 miles is very long.
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,865.87,866.884,--It is.
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.884,879.004,"I think the Thompson is only 2.8 and that is really close to Montello where it talked about, about two miles for some portage areas."
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,879.004,880.989,"Well, with respect, can I take both points."
2011.10-218,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.654,896.481,"But I'm not a Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are longer than--"
2011.10-218,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,896.481,898.357,"--Well, these -- this is still a big stretch."
2011.10-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.849,955.816,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,973.024,975.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-218,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1004.132,1004.759,"And why does that make a difference, Mr. Kneedler?"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1011.412,1031.513,"Well, in the Montello, for example, the question was whether there was admiralty or regulatory jurisdiction over the use of vessels on the upper reaches of the river, and that depended in the Court's view on whether that stretch was part of an interstate or international highway of commerce."
2011.10-218,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1076.338,1081.899,"I would think, though, if you start drawing these lines, they become very difficult, in some rivers anyway, to -- to apply."
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1103.279,1108.025,"Well, first of all, we're not -- we're not talking about chopping the river up into narrow slices."
2011.10-218,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.83,1135.454,So what's de minimis?
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1135.454,1138.094,"Well, I think--"
2011.10-218,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1138.094,1144.123,"Could 2.8 be de minimis in one situation and not, and how do we tell--"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1144.123,1146.638,--I -- I think it -- I think it may well be.
2011.10-218,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.428,1164.491,"--If there's no falls but there are riparian waters that don't permit navigability over 2.8, than that's still navigable?"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1165.567,1172.11,"--No, I think -- I think it has to be -- I'm speaking of a situation where the river is not navigable in fact."
2011.10-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.48,1185.388,"And it shouldn't matter whether it's 2.8 miles or 1 mile, right?"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1191.884,1193.023,"--For title purposes, yes."
2011.10-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.023,1194.025,"And that's what we're talking about, for title purposes."
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1197.102,1205.677,"Well, I -- I think at some -- if you -- if you consider part of the -- part of what is going on here is who controls the riverbed."
2011.10-218,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1221.372,1223.212,But how would the boat get up there?
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1226.808,1232.619,"--Well, in The Montello, the -- there is evidence that the boat was lifted."
2011.10-218,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.43,1235.679,Okay.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1236.662,1237.083,Pardon me?
2011.10-218,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.083,1237.692,Then that would work.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1237.692,1238.21,In that situation.
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1244.052,1247.004,You can't lift a boat over Niagara Falls.
2011.10-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.902,1263.978,The international boundary.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1263.978,1264.54,--It's owned by the State.
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1264.54,1265.682,It's owned by the State.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1267.823,1271.009,The reply brief I think--
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.009,1273.914,The navigable ones are owned by the State.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1287.251,1291.139,--That's not an -- I think that's not an extended strip in the way that -- the way that we're discussing here.
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.139,1291.498,--Okay.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1293.374,1294.091,"Well, if I--"
2011.10-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.091,1297.714,I thought it's also an international boundary--
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1297.714,1297.979,--Yes.
2011.10-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.979,1299.122,--As to which there is a different rule.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1299.122,1299.917,"Yes, and the--"
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.917,1300.339,Okay.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1313.818,1325.388,"--I think it does matter whether it's 5 feet, because the -- because an important point here is that, who can make sensible use or control the relevant stretch of the river."
2011.10-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.921,1332.263,A quick question that you could probably answer just by saying: We decided not to.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1360.531,1365.67,"--We could, and we have not given consideration to that, but that might be -- that might be a possibility."
2011.10-218,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.905,1382.088,"Could it have intervened somehow, because the -- the United States has come here rather reluctantly, because you recommended against granting cert in this case."
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1399.14,1405.074,"Ordinarily, the United States would not intervene in a State court proceeding, or if it did it would remove the case to Federal court."
2011.10-218,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1415.962,1418.774,Your -- your answer a moment ago gives me pause.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1425.115,1426.741,"Well, we would be bound by this Court's decision, obviously."
2011.10-218,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.687,1446.655,"And if we -- if it were remanded, the United States would still stay out of it?"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1446.655,1450.2,I assume so.
2011.10-218,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1452.559,1465.396,"--Am I to take that ""de minimis"" to you means small enough so that they get the boat physically over the portage, Whether they carry it, drag it?"
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1465.396,1465.74,No.
2011.10-218,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1481.825,1485.639,"Go back to carrying their boat on their shoulders, which apparently in The Montello they did."
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1486.512,1487.982,--They didn't carry the boat out of the river.
2011.10-218,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.452,1560.622,It's kind of odd.
2011.10-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1572.879,1576.802,"Well, that's -- that's a product of the -- of the equal footing doctrine."
2011.10-218,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.128,1581.283,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1584.719,1587.655,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.335,1664.97,"Under your theory, if there's a fall like this of 17 miles, and a train is 50 miles away and traverses that 17 miles, that portage is good enough."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1664.97,1673.402,You have to show that the commerce traveled along the river under the customary modes of trade and travel.
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1673.402,1683.258,"Outside of your fur traders and your gold miners, has that happened in any other situation -- your alleged gold miners and fur traders?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1689.084,1702.14,"If you take the Great Falls, the history of portage from 1864 to 1868 was lively commerce of millions of dollars, in today's value billions of dollars of gold, from Helena to Fort Benton back east."
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1705.623,1726.145,Could you -- could you do me a favor and you tell me again -- I am having real trouble with the competing evidence in this case with respect to every one of the three areas in dispute and I have some serious questions about whether the court properly granted summary judgment.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1735.987,1737.423,I--
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1737.423,1745.608,Your adversary says that it's a fair question if we determine there is any legal approach -- error in legal approach of the court below.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1755.291,1764.474,--The question presented is whether the Montana Supreme Court or whether a court -- a court -- what the constitutional test would be for a court in this situation.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.618,1794.855,For what purpose?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1828.153,1833.402,"--Your Honor, PPL recognizes that The Daniel Ball supplies the test for navigability for title."
2011.10-218,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1868.653,1875.649,What -- what do you understand to be the reason for the rule that the States own the navigable rivers?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1875.649,1889.251,"The reason for the rule was the public trust doctrine which -- which sought to keep these rivers free for the public to use for navigation, for fishing and for other uses; and this court's precedents--"
2011.10-218,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1889.251,1894.592,What do fishing and navigation have to do -- for -- what does fishing have to do with navigability?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1894.592,1898.577,"--Well, it gets back to the -- the public trust doctrine, Your Honor."
2011.10-218,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1904.092,1905.106,Let me put it this way.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1910.132,1924.674,"--Because the navigable rivers were the arteries of commerce in this country, and at the time of the founding it was understood -- and this gets to the core issue of federalism in this case -- that the States ought to be the ones that control the navigable rivers, not the Federal Government."
2011.10-218,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1924.674,1931.876,"Yes, and if that's the reason -- if that's the reason for the rule, than what is the justification for State ownership of a portion of the river that is not navigable?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1931.876,1937.592,I think this gets back to the question of whether you can just chop up the rivers into navigable and nonnavigable bits.
2011.10-218,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1957.757,1984.387,"The rule that you are arguing for might be an established rule that we should follow, but as a matter of theory I don't understand what the justification is for State ownership of a non-navigable portion of the river if the reason for the underlying rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an -- as an avenue of commerce."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1999.316,2008.172,"What -- what the Framers were concerned about and this is also reflected in the Northwest Ordinance 2, was ensuring that the navigable waters, the major arteries of commerce in this country, remained open."
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.059,2019.477,But -- but they are closed where they are -- they're impassable for ships anyway.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2022.101,2022.931,--And so that was the argument--
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.931,2023.087,You've -- you've got falls.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2033.363,2038.33,"--And so that was the argument that the district court adopted in The Montello case, and this Court emphatically rejected it."
2011.10-218,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.67,2052.541,"Mr. Garre, what is -- you say that you are not taking just -- you look at the whole river as a whole."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2055.072,2055.899,"No, it's not."
2011.10-218,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2055.899,2057.478,And that it's also not inch by inch.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2062.973,2066.349,I think the relevant stretch or segmentation is really a litigation term.
2011.10-218,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.92,2130.305,"So you just -- so you are disagreeing with the United States, which has given us its view of what the Federal law is."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2132.337,2136.615,--The United States has sided completely with Montana.
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.753,2149.249,"Just out of -- I mean, to waste your time for a second."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2160.199,2163.276,--I think if you -- if you applied the proper test here you would conclude that the river--
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.276,2170.447,"I mean, a little creek somewhere which you'd think, gee, those belong to the State, but it turns out the feds own the land underneath the little creek; is that right?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2170.447,2173.005,--I think what -- the nonnavigable parts--
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.005,2173.504,Yes.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2173.504,2175.13,--didn't transfer under the equal footing doctrine.
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.397,2179.88,I see.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2179.88,2188.08,--And what was--
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.08,2188.594,Is that right?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2188.594,2191.734,"--Yes, I think that's right."
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.734,2192.03,Okay.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2192.03,2198.075,And what was critically important to the -- to the Framers was that the States would have control over the navigable waterways.
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2201.557,2205.102,But we are talking about the land at the bottom of the -- the river.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2210.367,2226.078,"Well, owner -- ownership -- along with ownership goes the right to control whether facilities can be built on them, bridges or pipelines; it goes -- along with that goes the rights to mineral leases--"
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.078,2235.452,"But as the Chief Justice is indicating, I think, this concerns who owns the bed; and that is different from navigable waters of the United States."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2265.204,2266.016,--Right.
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.016,2275.495,And it's not clear to me that the test for navigable waters is the same in each case as to the whole river.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2275.495,2281.805,"Well, I think that the test that we are articulating is The Daniel Ball and Montello Test -- continuous highway test."
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.444,2296.02,"But, now, Montello was a case -- to follow up this same question."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2323.258,2324.537,"Well, the--"
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.537,2345.84,"What case should I look at to see -- was really meant that this -- to start with where Justice Scalia was and say what Justice Kennedy just said and then thinking well, I'm thinking well Montello is a case that involved a different purpose and now the later cases, although they quoted the language, it didn't have a role."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2346.936,2355.432,--This case has recognized always that The Daniel Ball and the Montello is the test for navigability for title as well as admiralty.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.554,2360.926,The question is has it held that.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2365.63,2368.878,Not of this Court.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.689,2369.814,Okay.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2369.814,2374.825,--have relied upon The Daniel Ball and Montello in plenty of circumstances adjudicating a title.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.105,2395.664,"If this is such an understood and traditional rule, why didn't Montana make its rights known earlier when these private owners bought the land?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2422.65,2426.135,"--PPL's deeds, Your Honor, PPL's deeds exclusively exclude the riverbeds at issue in this case."
2011.10-218,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2473.705,2475.457,And what about other land owners on the riverbeds.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2478.034,2482.452,"--They are not using the riverbeds, Your Honor."
2011.10-218,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2519.408,2520.281,I guess if I could understand then.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2525.827,2542.583,"--No, I think there are other land owners who have asserted -- who want rights to get minerals along rivers or have peers or bridges, and in those situations they get permits from the State to use it."
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2558.781,2560.704,Is there a mile stretch anywhere on this river.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2560.704,2561.827,--A mile stretch?
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2561.827,2562.357,Yes.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2568.698,2573.397,The two areas at issue here is the Great Falls stretch--
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2573.397,2574.349,--I know the two at issue.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2590.515,2597.995,"--So the test would be any non-de minimis interruption, that's the one that PPL and the United States are urging here."
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.115,2610.599,All right.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2656.597,2674.636,"--The best evidence I think we have about this question of the implications comes from the brief filed by 26 States, which explains that if this Court adopts the kind of segmentation approach, any interruption that is not de minimis has to be carved out it's going to wreak havoc in States across the country especially, in the western States."
2011.10-218,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.119,2691.662,"When you say wreak havoc, you mean to say that the States have leased those strips with the water falls which are impassable to hydroelectric companies and the leases will have to be renegotiated or something like that?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2691.662,2695.3,--I'm not referring to specific leases on that.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.773,2718.76,"Well, I thought you say it doesn't belong to the private individuals."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2721.181,2727.085,"--What this Court has said is if it's not navigable, the United States has it."
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.177,2728.598,--They are.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2732.891,2736.144,--The question is whether there would be a separate conveyance from the United States.
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.845,2742.173,"But you think they are wrong, right?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2742.173,2745.187,"Well, no."
2011.10-218,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2760.193,2773.857,"Mr. Garre, you said, this is genuinely a controversy between the States and the United States, but the United States is not a party to this litigation."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2797.46,2799.784,"--Well, the United States is here."
2011.10-218,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2809.093,2812.247,Does PPL pay rent to the United States.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2812.247,2814.716,--Not with respect to the riverbeds.
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2826.71,2829.303,Would you help me with this?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2877.174,2878.61,There certainly--
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2878.61,2881.406,"And, and if there is a difference, can you tell me a case?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2883.53,2891.649,"--There are two -- well, there is three distinctions between the test for title and the test for regulatory purposes."
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2891.649,2891.915,Yes.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2891.915,2894.181,None of which bear on the dispute in this case.
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2948.472,2968.684,"But it is conceded, is it not, that with -- if we rule for the power companies in this case, there still may be a situations in which these waters can be navigable waters of the United States for other purposes other than ownership of the bed."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2970.571,2975.958,"--No, I think the United States' position is, say they are navigable for Federal purposes but not for State purposes."
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.597,3014.004,"No, but I'm not sure it has the same consequences."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3040.681,3048.301,And so this Court has always recognized the State's authority to make those decisions as an essential attribute of their sovereignty.
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3049.533,3054.205,Without regard -- But I would say without regard to whether they happened to own the land under the river or not.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3054.205,3063.061,"--No, when they own the land under the river, that -- the ability to control access along those rivers and fishing and the like is an essential attribute of State sovereignty."
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.555,3132.593,"You are willing to concede on behalf of the State that if we find that the State does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes that you were now describing?"
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3132.593,3133.857,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.857,3136.418,"Well, then your argument doesn't carry much weight."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3141.212,3149.662,"And so every time this Court has said that the ability to do that is an essential attribute of sovereignty, it must not have meant it because the United States could do it, too."
2011.10-218,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.16,3166.297,"Well, you have sovereignty over the land owned, owned by other private persons."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3166.297,3183.509,"And I think it gets back to the Public Trust Doctrine, the Equal Footing Doctrine, what this Court has said in the Utah case and other cases about the role of states in regulating navigable rivers and owning title to the river beds underlying those rivers."
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3183.509,3185.319,We haven't talked much about the Madison.
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3192.958,3196.377,"Well, there was some evidence of use by fur trappers and the like."
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3198.986,3206.438,"Well, fur trappers are going to go -- they don't need a lot of water to ply their canoes up the river."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3206.438,3212.295,"Well, and this Court has recognized that things like pirogues and bateaux were sufficient to establish the continuous highway of commerce."
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3258.243,3262.743,"Counsel, was that the canal -- what subsequently became the canal area."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3262.743,3264.459,I -- I think that's right.
2011.10-218,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3292.087,3304.632,"I think that then the simplest rule is, is the river from shore to opposite shore -- any portion of it -- did boats traverse it."
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3307.725,3314.393,"But that's not even a rule that PPL was asking for, because they acknowledge that some interruptions would be navigable."
2011.10-218,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3348.237,3349.816,Did he write that during his 30-day -- 32-day portage?
2011.10-218,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3355.794,3357.436,"--Your Honor, it was an 11-day portage."
2011.10-218,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3391.143,3392.937,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-218,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3395.296,3397.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-218,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3398.873,3403.073,Portages that are de minimis.
2011.10-218,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3411.008,3413.633,"--I mean, I don't have any de minimis portages for you."
2011.10-218,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3457.958,3460.863,And what were your -- what were your other four points you were going to give us?
2011.10-218,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3460.863,3461.05,"Well, I've given you a couple, I'd start with the deeds."
2011.10-218,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3514.712,3516.99,Could the United States demand compensation?
2011.10-218,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3516.99,3520.164,--We pay the United States compensation right now.
2011.10-218,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3533.984,3534.343,For the riverbed?
2011.10-218,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3534.92,3538.355,"--Well, look at footnote 3 of the government's brief."
2011.10-218,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3659.646,3660.239,"Thank you, counsel."
