2018.16-1363,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.185,11.9849999,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1363, Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, versus Preap. Mr. Tripp."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,11.9849999,27.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A criminal alien does not become exempt from mandatory detention by the happenstance that DHS did not arrest them immediately or promptly after they got out of jail or prison."
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,89.64,95.37,So what meaning do you give to when the alien is released? Does it command you to do anything?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,95.37,105.21,"Yeah, the -- the key function of that, so -- is to tell the Secretary when to act, right? So it's aligned flush left, along with the command that the Secretary shall --"
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.21,113.92,"So you don't see any sense of urgency in your acting, no sense of encouraging you --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,113.92,114.38,"Oh, no, we --"
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,114.38,117.96,-- in some way to actually do what the statute says --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,117.96,118.08,We -- we --
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,118.08,119.3,-- which is to take custody of somebody?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,119.3,129.03,"-- we absolutely think that this conveys a sense of urgency, and I think we're in full agreement with Respondents that this is directing -- that -- that this is an urgent priority."
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.93,165.81,"So tell me why would you have -- need transition rules under your reading of this statute, which there were. And the transition rules said you have two years, essentially, to put in place enough personnel and facilities to do what the statute requires you to do. Why did you need that two-year period if, in your view, you have absolute discretion --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,165.81,165.98,It's --
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.98,168.62,-- to pick an alien up whenever you want to any way?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,168.62,177.42,I -- I think that's really not a fair characterization of our position. Our understanding is that this is a mandate. It -- it is triggered immediately.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.01,197.19,"No, no, no."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,223.035,229.18,"But, again, I want to be clear, we don't interpret this to say that we can arrest the person whenever we want."
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,244.09,244.52,So let's go to --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,244.52,245.61,-- because DHS doesn't know where the person is.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,245.61,248.375,-- let's go to the release provision.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,248.375,248.995,Right.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,248.995,253.235,Paragraph (1) is an entire paragraph.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,276.06,276.65,"Well, I guess --"
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,276.65,279.105,"Why doesn't it say paragraph (1), (A) through (D)?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,279.105,287.48,A -- a couple responses. I think those are the only portions of the statute that describe -- that actually describe the alien.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,292.75,294.595,It -- it describes the type of alien we're talking about.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,294.595,295.19,I -- I don't think --
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,295.19,299.465,It describes the person who's subject to this provision.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,299.465,312.86,"I -- I don't think that's right because it says when -- that might be right if it said something like the Secretary shall take into custody any alien who is inadmissible and deportable, you know, and who has not been released for more than such and such amount of time. But that's not what it says."
2018.16-1363,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.07,395.96,"Mr. Tripp, is your -- your position then it is totally irrelevant whether the -- the change in custody is immediate or it's seven years down the road? Whenever it occurs, the Attorney General has no discretion to have a bond hearing? Whenever it occurs, seven years, eight years, 10 years, the person is detained without bond, right?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,395.96,399.14,"Yes, that's absolutely our -- our understanding of (c)(2), yeah."
2018.16-1363,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,400.34,409.83,"Along those lines, Mr. Tripp, does the government have any view about if ever the obligation under (c) lapses? Could it be 30 years? Could it be --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,409.83,410.7,Under (c)(1)?
2018.16-1363,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,410.7,411.13,Yeah.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,422.18,451.27,"So we understand that -- that -- (c)(1) to be a continuing obligation, it does not lapse, but can I -- if I could just follow through with (a) -- with the text of (a) and just how this supports us on the custody determination, I think it would be helpful. So as I -- there's this first discretionary authority to arrest the alien and then the next sentence talks about what do you do after he's been arrested, and what it says is, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and pending such decision, the Secretary either may continue to detain him or may release him on bond."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,451.27,451.76,"So, Mr. Tripp --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,451.76,454.515,"But, of course, what (c) says is you can't release him at all."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,454.515,464.16,"-- just to think about how these two provisions interact with each other, I'm wondering if you can tell me with respect to a group of people who are not involved here."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,464.16,465.145,Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.145,472.71,"As I understand it, these (A) through (D) categories include some people who have never been in criminal custody at all."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,480.395,480.77,Right.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,480.77,483.85,So they fit within this (A) through (D) category.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,494.34,501.1,"The authority to -- so I think, actually, for all of them, the authority to do the arrest comes from (a)."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,525.52,526.08,I guess I'm not -- I'm not --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,526.08,527.43,-- it really ultimately doesn't matter.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,527.43,530.09,"Well, it sort of matters to me, I think."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,546.58,547.475,That's right.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,547.475,554.25,"So that would suggest that (c)(1) is authorizing their detention, and that's what you're saying?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,554.25,555.68,No.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,561.92,562.01,Yes.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,565.175,570.1,"I think actually, frankly, the answer is that we're arresting them under both (a) and (c)(1)."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,579.37,587.19,"Well, when you say you're arresting them under both, are you saying that with respect to everybody under (c)(1), you're also arresting --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,587.19,587.29,Yes.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,587.29,588.16,-- them under (a)? Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,589.51,590.0,Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,590.0,599.25,"You know, that kind of -- you're saying that those people are under (c)(1) to the same extent as people who have been in criminal custody?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,599.25,600.205,That's right.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,600.205,607.905,So that seems odd to me because (c)(1) seems to me all about people who have been in criminal custody.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,607.905,608.3,Well --
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,608.3,623.9,"Now you have this question about how about if there's a gap between the criminal custody, but -- but -- but your interpretation necessitates that you understand even people who have never been in criminal custody as part of the (c)(1) group."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,623.9,624.81,That's right.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,641.07,641.44,You know --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,641.44,642.86,"-- I think, really the paradigm of the statute."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,642.86,646.25,"-- yes, this is -- this is a small group relatively, but it's definitely a group."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,683.665,718.685,"I -- I -- I -- I think it's more that you may disagree about whether the duty to arrest -- the mandate to arrest them in (c)(1) kicks in when an alien has -- has not been in prior criminal custody, in some prior state or federal criminal custody, but even -- even if you disagree with us on that, so, first of all, all of the Respondents here have been in some prior custody. And, of -- of -- of course, what -- what we're really saying is that, you know, the -- the timing of their arrest, the timing of their release is just -- is -- is totally irrelevant when it comes to (c)(2)."
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.61,725.975,"What about the first part? I mean, we've read the briefs."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,731.53,732.45,They were released for --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.45,734.32,"I mean, they were arrested --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,734.32,734.38,Yeah.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.38,739.755,"-- 14 years after being released, and one for taking bus transfers."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,806.4,809.755,So a -- a couple of responses to that.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,817.33,831.68,"So you think a person 50 years later, who is on his death bed, after stealing some bus transfers, that this -- this paragraph says that the Attorney General shall release him and hold him without bail, even though in this country a triple ax murderer --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,831.68,832.36,So -- so --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.36,834.05,"-- is given bail, a hearing, a hearing?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,834.05,835.56,-- a couple more answers to that.
2018.16-1363,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,850.12,851.01,All right.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,851.82,852.32,-- this is under 1226(c)(1)(C).
2018.16-1363,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,852.32,853.29,"-- we're quibbling, Mr. Tripp."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,853.29,854.54,You need to be in jail for a year.
2018.16-1363,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,854.54,860.18,"Mr. Tripp, we're quibbling, all right? Justice Breyer's question is my question and I really wish you'd answer it."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,877.42,880.78,So I'm not trying to quibble over what's a crime involving moral turpitude.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.36,883.68,Let's say --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.68,897.9,"What is the answer, though? Is the government's position that this paragraph, which says shall be arrested upon release, applies to a person who has been released 50 years before? What is your position? I'm not even criticizing you, though I was."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,897.9,901.01,Our position is absolutely that this -- that this applies regardless of the time in.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,901.01,901.11,Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,901.28,902.895,This statute went into effect in 1998.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.1,904.19,Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,904.19,905.37,So -- so we're not -- not looking at that yet.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.37,906.33,"So your position is yes, he's 50."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,906.33,906.52,And then --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.52,906.78,Okay.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,907.06,908.24,-- to get into the constitutional question --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.24,908.49,But wait.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,939.44,939.53,Right.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.53,940.845,And the same is true here.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,940.845,941.22,That's right.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.22,944.07,And that I thought was your strong -- to me the strongest argument.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,944.07,944.29,Right.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.47,963.755,"So I thought then -- and this is my question -- I thought then, is this like those cases? And the answer I thought was: Well, yes, in the sense that there is A, no statement of what happens when you miss the deadline, right there, and, B, the government, well, says -- all right."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1026.93,1027.66,So I --
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.66,1030.98,So I thought in terms of the purposes -- are you following what I'm saying?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1030.98,1031.345,Yes.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1031.345,1044.715,"You see, in terms of the purposes of the bail statute or this statute or any other statute, we read it technically your way, and we hurt everybody in terms of the purposes."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1049.75,1051.72,So this is the piece I -- I want to push back on hard.
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1078.16,1078.43,Mr. Tripp?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1078.43,1079.41,That's the entire point.
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1079.41,1079.68,Mr. Tripp?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1079.68,1080.76,Congress looked at this issue.
2018.16-1363,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.35,1117.7,"And yet he -- yet he got cancellation of removal, didn't he?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1117.7,1119.12,He did get cancellation of removal.
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1127.9,1141.645,"Now, Mr. Tripp, what is the definition of the class that was certified by the district court? Does it consist of -- solely of people who have been -- who were released from criminal custody many years ago?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1141.645,1143.24,"No, not even close."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1158.35,1173.175,"Do you have any sense, understanding, even estimate of the -- in the whole class, how many people are people who were detained a day later? How many people were -- you know, were detained a year plus later?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1173.175,1173.45,Yeah.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.4,1230.88,"What about saying a reasonable time, the word -- the words that we know are there, ""upon his release,"" means a reasonable time within his release, you know, a reasonable time."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1258.23,1260.27,So I think a couple of responses.
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1286.91,1287.31,That only works --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1287.31,1290.2,-- the person has been out for 10 years and hasn't gotten into trouble --
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1290.2,1290.68,But are you saying --
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1290.68,1291.64,-- and is potentially eligible for --
2018.16-1363,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.64,1291.8,You -- you --
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1291.8,1308.12,"-- but are you saying, Mr. Tripp, that there's no constitutional claim as to any of these people, even if a person has been out for 15 years, has established ties in the community? Are you saying that there's no constitutional problem with that?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1308.12,1312.36,"So, I mean, we -- we certainly don't think there's a substantial constitutional problem that they have identified."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1325.07,1325.24,Right.
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1325.85,1326.53,"Well, that may or may not --"
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1326.53,1327.55,That's what I'm saying.
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1346.985,1349.73,I -- I think the answer is no under the analysis in Demore.
2018.16-1363,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.78,1371.59,But you -- could you explain then why Preap himself was eligible for relief?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1371.59,1379.325,Because not -- only some criminal aliens and -- and more -- more LPRs have eligibility for relief.
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.12,1398.96,"Look, would you do me one favor? First, assume I'm right, which I know is a heroic assumption. (Laughter.)"
2018.16-1363,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1398.96,1411.025,"But -- but -- but assume that there's a constitutional problem in a country which gives every triple ax murderer a bail hearing, but these people don't, okay? All you're involved is a bail hearing."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1435.44,1467.51,"I -- I think the real concern is really what Congress was getting at here, is that making this prediction of which criminal aliens are going to flee and which are going to re-offend is actually really, really hard, right? And I think, you know, the -- the example of Mr. Rodriguez Moya, I think, drives that home, you know, that when IJs were doing this with the criminal alien in front of them, on the basis of the traditional bail factors, Congress's basic judgment was that too many of them were going to be released and that it actually wasn't working. And so Congress, you know, they experimented with this."
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1472.79,1473.38,"Well, Mr. Tripp --"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1473.38,1474.06,-- for mandatory detention.
2018.16-1363,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1474.06,1522.51,"-- you've been -- you've been pushed on the question whether there might be some circumstances in which an alien who would otherwise fall within the statute would have a constitutional right to a bail hearing, but I thought the question that we agreed to decide related to the -- what the Ninth Circuit saw as a requirement that the alien that -- that Homeland Security take the alien into custody immediately, and that was the class of aliens that was certified by the district court. So, if we were to reverse that determination, would that preclude a challenge by -- an individual challenge, an as-applied challenge by an alien who fell within the -- the circumstances that have been described?"
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1522.51,1523.5,"No, of course not."
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1529.05,1539.45,"And -- and do you agree that an alien could bring that challenge, notwithstanding 1226(e)? So 1226(e), right, is -- is -- is the jurisdictional provision."
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1539.45,1539.73,Yes.
2018.16-1363,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1539.73,1544.93,Does that at all prevent an alien from bringing the kind of challenge that Justice Alito is talking about?
2018.16-1363,0,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1544.93,1553.34,"I -- I think -- our understanding is no, actually, aliens bring these kinds of claims in the prolonged detention context with some frequency. If I -- if I could reserve the balance of my time."
2018.16-1363,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.34,1572.61,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Wang."

2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,1896.65,1904.5,"Your Honor, well, the person who is detained immediately falls under Congress's scheme."
2018.16-1363,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1917.99,1934.895,"But suppose I'm the -- I'm the alien in the category that's picked up immediately, and I ask you, explain to me why I don't get a hearing and yet someone who had the benefit of being out for two years, three years, does get a hearing."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,1934.895,1967.665,"My first response to you, Justice Ginsburg, would be that's what the statute provides. And the second response is that the Court decided in Demore in 2003 that applying the mandatory detention rule, at least, not considering the question before the Court now, is constitutional. And that brings me, I think, to the -- to answer the question about constitutional avoidance that you brought up, Justice Breyer, that when Congress -- there are two reasons the government says better late than never."

2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1993.61,2004.245,"Immediately? So as soon as the person is -- walks out of the door of the prison or the jail, if -- if ICE doesn't take the person into custody at that point, that's the end of it?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2004.245,2005.19,"No, Your Honor."
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2012.84,2013.2,What -- what does --
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2013.2,2014.715,Is that different from --
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.715,2029.86,"What does ""a reasonable degree of immediacy"" mean? I mean, let's -- I don't know how many people will be released from criminal custody today in, let's say, the State of California, but I'm sure there are dozens, probably hundreds."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2058.46,2061.165,"Congress provided for how they would do that, Justice Alito."
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2112.18,2123.545,"So the first part of your answer is that -- that the state -- the state governments, the municipal governments are going to provide this information to -- to the Department of Homeland Security?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2123.545,2127.085,"That is what Congress anticipated when it wrote this statute in '96, yes."
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2127.085,2128.89,And is that what is happening now?
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2128.89,2131.795,"Your Honor, it's largely what is happening now."
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2167.28,2179.98,"Yeah, and what they enacted was a provision that says the Attorney General, now, the Secretary shall take into custody any alien who satisfies certain requirements when the alien is released."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2179.98,2181.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2218.16,2218.84,"Well, Ms. Wang, on the --"
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2218.84,2234.73,"But we have to decide whether ""when the alien is released"" means, as you say, as the Ninth Circuit said, immediately, within 48 hours, within some reasonable period, or after the alien is released. In simple terms, that's the question before us, right?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2234.73,2235.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.16-1363,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.9,2278.575,"What's wrong with when a -- a reasonable time has been in the law since Lord Cooke, I mean, and courts have managed to deal with it."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2285.29,2286.79,"That's exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2018.16-1363,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.79,2288.3,I'm not sure the Ninth Circuit said that.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2288.3,2288.57,That's right.
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.57,2295.75,"Well, is that -- I mean, there's a difference between ""reasonable degree of immediacy"" and ""reasonable time."" I -- I don't see how immediate is immediate."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2328.155,2328.54,I think --
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2328.54,2331.91,"So which is it, reasonable degree of immediacy or reasonable time?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2331.91,2347.04,"Your Honor, I think that the Ninth Circuit was using the phrase ""reasonable"" with respect to a temporal scope, not with respect to whether the government was making reasonable efforts or acting in good faith. The statute says ""when,"" which, as the BIA acknowledged, connotes immediacy."
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.04,2355.75,"Yeah, but as Judge -- Judge Kayatta pointed out in his opinion, ""when"" could be -- you know, if you're saying it's not immediate, then who knows? Maybe it's a year."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2357.3,2366.48,"Well, Your Honor, I think it would certainly not be in any sense of the word ""when released,"" ""when the alien is released."" A year would not suffice."
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.41,2367.53,Okay.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2368.94,2369.23,Sure.
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2384.61,2384.7,Okay.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2392.825,2396.455,"Your Honor, we think 48 hours is too long, as Rojas said."
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.85,2398.405,"Well, okay. So you think it's the same day?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2398.405,2400.29,"We -- we think it's the same day, Your Honor."

2018.16-1363,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2434.88,2443.145,"In your class, how many people have been -- what percentage of the class has been out for, let's say -- let's just call it a year plus?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2443.145,2447.15,"Justice Kagan, we didn't get discovery in this case that's before the Court."

2018.16-1363,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2452.66,2454.51,What -- what -- what was the answer on that case?
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2454.51,2457.83,"In Gordon, the average delay was three years."
2018.16-1363,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2460.46,2461.79,In -- in that class?
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2461.79,2463.85,"In that class, correct, in the Gordon case."
2018.16-1363,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2466.96,2472.275,"Ms. Wang, let's assume a situation, hypothetical."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2520.47000005,2522.48,"That's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.16-1363,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2522.59,2555.19,"So, if there is a difference, why are we marking a temporal limit on what ""reasonable effort to comply with the statute"" might mean? It seems to me Justice Breyer's right, that the law is filled with the reasonable effort to comply with the terms of a command, but I don't see how we can set a temporal limit to that reasonable effort in the way that you're promoting."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2555.19,2560.66,"I think you can, Justice Sotomayor, because, again, I'm trying to stay true to the words Congress wrote."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2624.18,2624.93,"Ms. Wang, your -- your --"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2624.93,2625.24,I'm sorry.
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2625.35,2626.23,"Oh, no, if you go ahead and finish --"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2626.23,2626.56,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2626.56,2627.51,-- but I've got a question after.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2627.51,2629.11,I will quickly just get to the --
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2629.11,2629.405,Please.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2629.405,2636.625,"-- cut to the chase. So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the statute Congress wrote speaks in temporal terms."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2652.49,2653.71,Okay.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2718.71,2721.405,"Well, I think I'm a grammarian too."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2732.95,2736.015,Usually they modify the verb.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2736.015,2736.5,I'll -- I will --
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2736.5,2737.54,So let's start there.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2737.54,2738.06,-- I will concede that.
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2738.06,2746.43,"Why should we -- you're asking us to take a rather unusual view of grammar, one I think I'd have to delve pretty deep in the footnotes to find."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2746.43,2747.05,It wouldn't be the --
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2747.05,2748.315,So why would I do that?
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2748.315,2751.88,"It wouldn't be the first time Congress tortured grammar, but --"
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2751.88,2754.12,"This -- this, I won't argue with you about."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2754.12,2754.44,Right.
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2816.02,2820.95,"I'm not sure I -- I mean, I follow the example, but I'm not sure I buy it, and let me tell you why."
2018.16-1363,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2825.85,2849.395,"I think -- I think my fifth grade grammar teacher would love this discussion, but I would say to you or I'd challenge you with this, that, again, there you're modifying the verb, when you're supposed to harvest it, okay? And that's the first -- the first section. The second section, you're saying, okay, whatever you've harvested, the grapes that we've described that you have harvested. You still have to have harvested them."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2858.57,2868.505,"I -- I guess, Justice Gorsuch, I think another way to put this is that what the government's referring to as an adverbial phrase could be rephrased as an adjective."
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2907.975,2916.19,"But Congress would have known or thought that it wasn't going to be immediate in many cases, correct?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2916.19,2918.775,"Yes, Justice Kavanaugh. And the consequence --"
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2918.775,2951.89,"And -- and yet Congress did not put in a time limit, whether it's reasonable time, as Justice Breyer says, or a year or two years or six months or 48 hours. And so, when you combine those two points, Congress knew it wouldn't be immediate, and yet Congress did not put in a time limit. That raises a real question for me whether we should be superimposing a time limit into the statute when Congress, at least as I read it, did not itself do so. How do you respond to that?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2951.89,2955.51,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, we're not asking you to superimpose a time limit."
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2960.8,2961.48,But you're --
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2961.48,2961.82,-- but --
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2961.82,2994.31,"I'm sorry to interrupt -- but, when you say ""when,"" you are saying that is, in essence, a time limit of immediate, same day, I think you said. And my point is that's very odd when you think about what Congress was doing in 1996, because they were well aware that would not happen, A, because of resources, B, because they're not learning about it right away. And it would be odd to think, okay, that's what this statute means, even though it would often not be effectuated in that way."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,2994.31,3005.89,"Well, Your Honor, I think, again, Congress, first, as Justice Breyer noted, Congress often will have kind of a soft target when they legislate in this way. Second, remember --"
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3005.89,3011.735,"Well, the -- a soft target would be what Justice Breyer might say, reasonable time."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3020.375,3033.0,"I think -- I think, Your Honor, that Congress in saying ""when"" meant what ""when"" means in the common sense, a reasonable -- within a reasonable time of the event happening. We go to the dictionary definition --"
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3033.0,3033.36,"Well, in the follow-up on --"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3033.36,3033.93,-- as Judge Breyer noted --
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3033.93,3039.545,"-- the Chief Justice's point, reasonable immediacy is different from reasonable time in your view?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3039.545,3046.47,"I think that the Ninth Circuit used ""reasonable degree of immediacy"" and ""promptly"" interchangeably."
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3080.15,3083.68,The problem is that Congress did not trust those hearings for --
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3083.68,3084.28,"But, Your Honor, the --"
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3084.28,3099.335,"-- a certain class, is -- is my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong about that, but Congress was concerned that those hearings were not working in the way that Congress wanted and, therefore, for a certain class of criminal or terrorist aliens, said no more."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3099.335,3100.12,That's right.
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3132.37,3133.23,"Yeah, I can see that --"
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3133.23,3139.19,"Well, they might agree, but every other circuit, four of them, and an equally divided First Circuit, disagree?"
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3139.19,3168.45,"Well, some of the circuits, Your Honor, deferred to the BIA's reading, which the government's asking you partly to defer to and partly not, since they disagree with the BIA's reading of paragraph (1) but not with paragraph (2). And for -- and the Fourth Circuit actually read the -- the Rojas decision incorrectly and deferred on the ""when release"" ground. I think that the -- the First Circuit panel in Judge Baron and the Ninth Circuit below got this right."
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3216.135,3231.69,"Is that presumption based on what we think was really going through Congress's mind at the time, or is it based on a constitutional overlay? Because what was really going through Congress's time in 1996 was harshness on this topic."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3232.945,3239.16,Congress was -- was certainly trying to deal with what they considered to be a problem with non-citizens who have committed crimes.
2018.16-1363,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3242.425,3242.67,Right.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3242.67,3247.425,And I think that the words that Congress chose are narrow ones.
2018.16-1363,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3258.99,3263.99,I can see the equities when the alien has been free for a number of years.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3288.295,3289.73,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
2018.16-1363,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.78,3318.16,They face that --
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3318.16,3318.7,-- wanted to --
2018.16-1363,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.7,3346.825,"-- but what would you think of -- I see the problem of reasonable time, but Demore concerned a case where the Court thought that these people were detained without bail hearings for less than six months. Zadvydas interprets a silent statute to imply a six-month limitation on other but related holding of aliens."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3374.97,3376.495,Your Honor -- may I finish?
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.495,3377.05,Sure.
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3377.05,3398.315,"Your Honor, I think that, Justice Breyer, the six months would be an extraordinary amount of time and just gets a little far afield from the words Congress chose. And I remind you that the Board of Immigration Appeals said 48 hours was too long. So, if the Court wishes to draw a bright line, as you did in Zadvydas, I think that would be fine."
2018.16-1363,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.995,3403.545,"Thank you, Ms. Wang. Four minutes, Mr. Tripp."
2018.16-1363,1,63040,cecillia_d_wang,,3403.545,3406.98500005,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3406.98500005,3409.14,Thank you.
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3422.75,3430.835,"It just begs the question, because they didn't say sub -- paragraph (1), A through D."
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3433.01,3433.84,That's right.
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3434.12,3446.905,"And why isn't the verb, the adverb, part of the noun in that situation? Because, if they wanted to limit it to that class of A to D, that's the easiest thing to have done."
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3446.905,3447.64,Because --
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3447.64,3457.29,"Your counsel is -- your adversary's right, if they wanted to limit 1226(a) to (c)(2), they would have said (c)(2)."
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3457.29,3467.09,"So a couple of responses, but I think the main one is that the phrase ""when the alien is released"" does not modify who the alien is."
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3469.46,3469.99,"No, it is -- it is --"
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3469.99,3472.07,-- just modifies the duties of the Secretary.
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3472.07,3473.755,You're begging the question.
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3480.37,3481.19,I -- I --
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3481.19,3490.58,You by yourself -- you say that there's a command that you have to follow to try to take these people into custody.
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3512.0,3515.29,So I -- I think three responses I'll just --
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3515.29,3516.85,"The noun and the verb, I should say."
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3516.85,3530.28,"So, first, we just don't think it modifies who the alien is at all. Second, even if you think that it does, and there is some kind of timing requirement, this Court has said again and again and again that it's better to be late than never."
2018.16-1363,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3543.97,3544.1,If --
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3544.1,3545.71,-- that categorically prohibits release.
2018.16-1363,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3545.71,3559.63,"-- if reasonable amount of time, Justice Breyer's suggestion, were part of a ruling, what do you think is a reasonable amount of time or presumptively reasonable? I know that's not your preferred position, but do you have thoughts on that?"
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3559.63,3566.65,I -- I think our -- our main answer is that would be really profoundly problematic because the gaps in custody are often very long.
2018.16-1363,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3568.43,3579.64,"So, therefore, you would say a long period is a reasonable period, but do you have any more meat you want to put on those bones of what a reasonable period of time would be, given all the circumstances?"
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3579.64,3600.44,"I guess I -- I would say that, I mean, what often happens is, you know, once -- once an alien gets out, so I -- I think this comes across in the -- in the brief, the alien is often released before DHS is even aware that that's going to happen, is even aware that the person is one of these aliens. And once the person's out, it's going to be much more difficult to track them down. DHS might not know where they -- where they live, how to find them."
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3617.12,3618.24,The problem is that --
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3618.24,3619.09,-- of some long period of time --
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3619.09,3628.77,"-- if that's the only way you come -- that -- become aware of them, they get arrested, you can hold them. You can do what you should have done the first time, which is to --"
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3628.77,3629.49,But -- but --
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3629.49,3630.33,-- put a detainer on them.
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3630.33,3637.76,"-- under -- under -- I mean, so with Mr. Mony Preap, we did arrest him just as he got out the second time, but that second offense didn't trigger 1226(c)."
2018.16-1363,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.98,3649.84,I guess the problem that I have is you're -- you're pitting two groups of people.
2018.16-1363,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.41,3696.39,You may answer briefly.
2018.16-1363,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3696.39,3702.42,So none of those numbers are in the record and I -- I don't think we would agree with them.
2018.16-1363,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3713.51,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
