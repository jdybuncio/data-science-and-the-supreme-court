1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.182,"Number 268, Parker against North Carolina."
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,20.182,22.083,May it please the Court.
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,23.871,24.02,Mr. Smith.
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,24.02,28.032,"I'm Norman Smith, I represent the petitioner in this case."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.475,213.366,Are you familiar or not with the -- with the law of your state which I certain I'm not to know whether it is the practice to do that or not sure or is it varied by county or is it varied by case or what?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,213.366,223.683,"It varies by the -- most of operation of individual solicitors and judge, There is as far as I know no statutory compulsion that this be done."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.455,239.168,On this four I gather that is from the record of the other case?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,239.168,243.215,"Yes, there is no attention to the rules of evidence during such hearings."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.981,279.294,"This is a guilty plea and I suppose the purpose is to (a) ascertain whether the guilty plea is knowingly and voluntarily made not to cut against your case, I don't mean to, but and then but the purpose generally is for that and then also I suppose insofar as the trial judge has discretion in imposing sentence to apprise him of the circumstances of the offense so he can intelligently exercise his discretion, would that be?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,279.294,291.937,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's true, I think some of our judges except the philosophy of Rule 11 to the effect that there should always be basis in fact for the plea and then also of course it must be knowingly and voluntarily --"
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.937,296.289,"In this case, there was no discretion as far as the [Voice Overlaps] --"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,296.289,297.665,The record does indicate --
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.665,299.197,-- am I correct about that?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,299.197,313.348,"There was some colloquially between the court and the defendant and between the court and defendant's mother in which the court did inquire in the certain circumstances of defendant, his age, his educational background."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.766,332.915,"Just before you proceed, perhaps you didn't understand my last question."
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,337.05,339.614,"I'm sorry, no this was under our old rule --"
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.614,340.987,A mandatory life sentence --
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,340.987,342.746,"-- and it was a mandatory life sentence, yes."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.746,344.697,"-- could not be greater, could not be less?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,344.697,346.245,That's right sir.
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,557.595,574.905,"Well, counsel could you tell me whether in any case where the death sentence is a possibility, is it permitted in your view for the defendant to plead guilty to some lesser offense?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,580.325,591.07,"Well, Your Honor of course the facts of my case do not involve a lesser offense, but I realize that the Court does have that problem in the series of cases."
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,646.227,651.89,And that's because he plea -- he entered a plea of guilty as charged?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,651.89,661.551,"Yes to the offense which ordinarily would be capital, were it not for the entering of the guilty plea."
1969.268,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,661.551,669.595,"I presume that the stopping place would be a constitutional stopping place, wouldn't it, not just a decision of this Court?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,669.595,675.326,"Well, of course this Court is charged with the duty of finding such as stopping place, Your Honor."
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,723.454,734.964,"That would be every case, wouldn't it, wouldn't the fear of the death house always be factor that could exert influence, if not the coercion?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,734.964,735.583,"Well, --"
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,735.583,736.188,How could it not?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,736.188,740.91,-- I think one would have to say substantial influence.
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,740.91,743.207,Could it be otherwise?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,743.207,745.721,I think it probably could be otherwise.
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.721,761.668,Do you think -- do you see anything in the constitution which either forbids or tends to discourage or cast any doubt upon the whole idea of having guilty pleas entered in criminal cases?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,761.668,765.341,"No, Your Honor I certainly am not attacking idea of allowing guilty pleas."
1969.268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.563,864.338,Is your client [Inaudible] bars or --?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,864.338,873.275,"No, he's been denied relief all along the way and he is serving his life sentence."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.165,955.611,"Is your United States against Jackson argument really just a part of a coerced confession argument or do you think it's an additional or different argument, did it deny it?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,955.611,955.96,Oh!
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.378,1001.766,"So, you think in this case the -- your claim is that the guilty plea resulted from a combination of things, all bad --"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1001.766,1002.52,That's right.
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.52,1015.874,"-- (A) a coerced confession and (B) the statutory scheme of North Carolina which was coercive upon a person to plead guilty, is that it?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1015.874,1016.966,That's right sir.
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.966,1019.317,A combination of both?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1019.317,1037.483,"And we have another aspect to this case I want to bring briefly to the Court's attention if I may that is a completely unrelated matter, but certiorari was just generally granted in this case so I assume that the Court is interested in it."
1969.268,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.76,1115.152,What do you say to the answer that Court of Appeals made that that was objected to little -- three years after the conviction?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1115.152,1118.515,"That's the problem Your Honor, I think were faced with here."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1247.216,1254.766,The constitution you say compels that this conviction be set aside -- this judgment be set aside?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1254.766,1255.422,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.422,1256.849,And for what?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1256.849,1258.254,"Well, for two reasons."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.254,1263.536,"Yes, I understand why you say it should be set aside, but then set aside and for what further proceeding?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1263.536,1268.76,"Well, I should think the state would have to bring a new indictment against the petitioner and would have try him anew."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.76,1272.331,Try him or could he plead guilty?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1272.331,1275.322,"Well, he probably could plead guilty if he chose to do so --"
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.322,1278.036,Then wouldn't we back here with the same case?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1278.036,1285.705,"Well, if I were his lawyer I wouldn't advise him to plead guilty under the circumstances."
1969.268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.921,1329.635,"But that would as a practical matter I suppose to be the result or reversal, would it not, that he'd be tried again by a jury which as I understand it if there is a finding of guilt would result in a death sentence unless the jury recommended mercy in which it would be a life sentence?"
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1329.635,1354.037,"Yes sir, he fully understands that because I explained this to a very throughly before the post conviction proceeding was commenced whether, a point Ms. Bray discussed is whether one once having received life can be put at risk of death again under these double jeopardy cases as I suppose at issue here."
1969.268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.037,1363.011,You say he thought he could -- you'd won if he were indictment to the plea guilty under the North Carolina statute?
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1363.011,1368.587,Not -- he could not plea guilty to burglary or rape because you can no longer do so in North Carolina.
1969.268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.587,1369.277,[Inaudible]
1969.268,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1369.277,1372.823,That's right.
1969.268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1384.735,1389.345,Mr. Safron.
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1389.345,1392.335,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1453.744,1455.839,You say the house was under surveillance.
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1455.839,1457.486,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1457.486,1460.057,At the time the burglary was committed?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1460.057,1463.457,This is four nights later when he comes back --
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1463.457,1463.667,Yes.
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1463.667,1465.253,The house was under surveillance.
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1465.253,1466.266,Four nights later?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1466.266,1467.176,That's right Your Honor.
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1467.176,1470.042,But it was not the night that was broken into.
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1470.042,1470.167,Oh!
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1589.651,1591.615,What did you say counsel's was name was?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1591.615,1593.242,Cranford.
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1593.242,1595.374,Not the counsel that's now representing?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1595.374,1596.159,"No, Your Honor."
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1638.076,1641.2,Is that evidence undisputed?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1641.2,1642.722,Completely undisputed Your Honor.
1969.268,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1642.722,1643.741,What you say?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1643.741,1652.03,"That's undisputed, that's on page 67 of the appendix."
1969.268,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1780.628,1782.611,And how old was he at that time?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1782.611,1784.986,"He was 15, Your Honor."
1969.268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.004,2052.224,"Mr. Safron, what worries me just this moment, is that these two lawyers were so abundantly cautious in getting all this business for the plea of guilty, but they didn't get it written up that he voluntarily waived his grievance against the grand jury, is that correct?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2052.224,2053.817,"That's true Your Honor, it's not included."
1969.268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.264,2080.429,"During all these discussion with his mother over two days, am I correct?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2080.429,2081.056,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2081.056,2082.893,Was that matter discussed?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2082.893,2084.645,Apparently not.
1969.268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.645,2089.799,How could it been waived if it wasn't discussed?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2089.799,2102.263,"Well, he was represented by privately retained counsel, Your Honor and apparently privately retained counsel was doing -- performing for his client the best services that he thought available under the circumstances."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.271,2463.13,What do you do about the segregated taxes?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2463.13,2470.288,"That of course Your Honor -- that has been abolished by statute, at that time it was required by statute."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.288,2471.764,How about this case?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2471.764,2482.123,"Now, at the time this grand jury was selected, there were two tax lists, one for white and one for Negro."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.123,2494.949,"Well, how about the -- do you mean the names were drawn of the taxes lists after they were drawn?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2494.949,2501.44,"Once they were taken from the list, they had no designation and I believe in this case and most other cases --"
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.44,2505.925,Why this --
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2505.925,2519.396,"Of course Your Honor, in this case at the post conviction hearing conducted by Mr. Smith himself, he completely failed to show except to his statistics that there was any discrimination."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.567,2536.147,What university major in the number of Negroes on its grand jury against all the total population or just the names?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2541.97,2542.42,Women?
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.233,2552.835,"Well, it must to be there years if I understood briefs that women weren't serving on those grand juries [Voice Overlaps]"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2552.835,2555.093,Oh!
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.143,2578.811,"So, we're measuring this against capital problem, not the population?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2578.811,2581.014,"Perhaps so Your Honor, yes."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.014,2592.519,But even so the 134 Negroes out of the total number of grand jurors is the -- how do you suppose that happened?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2592.519,2602.362,"Well, --Just because that the -- just the commissioners didn't know Negroes or was it because they knew Negroes, but thought they were incompetent?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2602.362,2619.045,"No, the testimony that was brought out was that the same criteria was used in selecting white prospective grand jurors as the Negro grand jurors, that the criteria used was the criteria of the North Carolina statute."
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.045,2631.749,"Well, then if you have the -- if they employed the same criteria and they examine the same number of Negroes and whites where you can get the same number of Negroes and whites on the jury list, but that wasn't so?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2631.749,2638.49,I would submit this that the commissioners knew more white people.
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.49,2639.544,"That's the answer, isn't it?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2639.544,2640.819,I --
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.819,2645.785,And they didn't know very many Negroes to whom to apply the criteria?
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2645.785,2655.893,But the criteria was equally applied and I submit it's similar to the situation formally in effect in the federal system.
1969.268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.317,2669.857,"Since the taxes lists were segregated then knew how many Negro names they were considering and how many white names they were considering, didn't they?"
1969.268,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2669.857,2679.423,"Of course, the total number of names was before them in the tax list, you would have two volumes at that time, one white, one colored."
1969.268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.66,2728.614,The case is submitted.
