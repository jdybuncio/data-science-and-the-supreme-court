1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.272,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-732, Western Airlines versus Board of Equalization of the State of South Dakota."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,15.093,20.562,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,263.65,268.035,"In other words, they draw a distinction between subject to and subjected to, I take it?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,268.035,269.386,"Exactly, Justice Black."
1986.85-732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.386,275.04,"While I have you interrupted, Continental was a party to this at one-time, wasn't it?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,275.04,277.076,Continental was a party in the lower court.
1986.85-732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.626,282.211,"Are they a respondent here, then, I suppose?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,282.211,286.579,"Well, they would benefit from a favorable decision of the Court."
1986.85-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.65,295.519,Are they still flying in South Dakota?
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,295.519,298.352,"I can't be sure of that, Justice White, either."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.082,355.586,"You usually say ""subject to further order"", just as here it would be more natural to say ""subject to property tax levy"", rather than"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,360.14,377.517,"I think you could make something out of that distinction, Justice Scalia, but it seems to me that is looking at this with a semantic microscope, really, when Congress was painting a picture here with very broad strokes."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.11,403.483,What do you think it means... what is excluded if it does not refer to a particular property tax?
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,413.754,421.444,"I think it's what could constitutionally, and I think it was also probably meant to exclude property that was traditionally nontaxable by the states."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.444,431.216,"What commercial or industrial property wouldn't constitutionally be subject to a property tax levy, commercial or industrial property?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,431.216,437.804,"Well, there are commercial properties being put to a commercial or industrial use by the Federal Government that are not taxable."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.393,449.427,"Well, but I'm not saying not taxable in some states."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,477.947,502.242,Could I answer it this way: The words
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.975,541.2,"Well, Mr. Rasenberger, at the time that the language referred to all property, wasn't traditionally exempt property already excluded from all property?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,541.2,542.485,--Yes.
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,542.485,547.771,"I mean, charitable property wasn't being taxed at that time, or federal owned, or so forth?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,547.771,551.34,"That's right, and an argument can be made that the words"
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.459,559.225,"Exactly, just pure surplusage, on your argument."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,559.225,562.446,"--From the very beginning you could regard them that way, yes."
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.446,572.969,"Well, that's kind of a curious argument, because usually we think when Congress adds new language like that it must be intended to mean something, and on your interpretation it wouldn't."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,572.969,576.504,"Adds new language such as ""commercial and industrial property""?"
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.504,578.789,"Adds language, yes."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,578.789,597.334,"When Congress added the words ""commercial and industrial property"" it was trying to narrow the comparison class to some extent, to get at what they were really concerned about, which was business property and not all other property."
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.123,611.027,"But as I understand Justice O'Connor's question and your answer, you agreed that the term"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,617.847,620.299,Yes.
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.582,689.425,"Well, as I understood Justice O'Connor's point, and it commends itself to me to a certain extent, we don't ordinarily... we're loath to say that a proviso or a clause in an act of Congress is just surplusage, that it really meant nothing."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,689.425,693.245,"I understand that, and I'm saying it still means something even today."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.803,706.786,Federal facilities?
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,706.786,710.957,"Federal facilities: the TVA, Amtrak, property like that."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.122,741.476,That's a pretty fine line to draw in a statute that you tell us was sort of thrown together.
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,762.39,766.775,It was not a rush job in the sense that it took place over a period of 15 years.
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.715,824.344,"Perhaps Congress wanted to leave to states the availability of treating some commercial and industrial property specially and not subjecting them to a tax levy at all, such as in order to attract new business or something of that sort."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,843.572,850.226,"Well, averaging that rate into the total rate for all property in the state, yes, I think that's right."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.226,857.813,"But isn't that a good reason for Congress conceivably making that exception, that it's only property that is actually subject to a levy that we've talking about?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,857.813,993.327,"Well, as I say, there is no specific legislative history on the subject, except the railroads at one time were asked what they thought the term"
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.099,1006.587,"Mr. Rasenberger, supposing you prevail here."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1011.039,1021.347,"They would have to develop an average rate for personal property in the state that is subject, that is eligible for taxation."
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.347,1026.148,"Well, that really, you could argue, that's the tail wagging the dog the other way."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1040.723,1043.675,The state has the option of not taxing airlines.
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.651,1065.09,"Well, on that point, there is, of course, a statutory exception for an in lieu tax which is used for airport and aeronautical purposes."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1077.683,1087.372,"Well, the lower court, the South Dakota Supreme Court, rejected the argument that it was an in lieu tax, on the theory that it wasn't in lieu of anything, which I think was a correct holding."
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.372,1093.443,"Do you suppose whether it is or is not is a matter of federal definition, though, ultimately?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1093.443,1095.745,Whether it is or is not in lieu?
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1095.745,1096.845,Whether it's an in lieu tax.
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1096.845,1105.417,"Well, it seems to me that if you're asking does the Court have that issue before it, I would say no."
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1105.417,1121.343,"I think it doesn't, but I'm also suggesting that certainly in this situation it's very possible that a state could indeed single out airlines for tax under this in lieu exemption."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1121.343,1124.245,"Yes, it certainly could, it certainly could."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.972,1157.135,"What do you make of the fact that the provision that applied to railroads, which did explicitly prohibit all other discrimination against interstate commerce in effect, does not exist with respect to airlines?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1178.965,1193.623,"Well, let me start by saying it was put in for railroads at the very last minute in the legislative history, because the railroads called to the attention of the committee a gross receipts tax that New York was imposing on the New York Dock Railway."
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.074,1251.144,"May I go back to Justice O'Connor's question, please, on the in lieu tax."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1257.798,1259.031,Yes.
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.031,1277.712,"And is it not possible that Congress, what Congress was saying is that if you're using... if you're going to tax airlines for general revenue purposes, then you've got to treat them like others who are being taxed for general revenue purposes, but if you're going to just raise money for airports and aeronautical purposes it's fair to impose the entire tax on the airlines?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1279.978,1284.366,If you're at the same time excusing the airlines from paying another tax.
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.366,1290.436,"Well, that's the only tax at issue here, is the one that the trial court thought was an in lieu tax."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1290.436,1294.638,"But we're not being excused from paying any other tax, because no other tax would apply to us."
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.638,1298.625,"Well, they aren't charging other commercial and industrial purposes this same tax."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1302.91,1310.914,"Well, I think if the statute said it doesn't apply to a tax used for aeronautical purposes, that would be the correct answer."
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.718,1318.003,"It doesn't apply to tax that's used solely for aeronautical, and that's what this one is."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1318.003,1318.82,In lieu.
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.82,1319.27,Yes.
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1331.593,1336.964,"Well, neither the state nor the Appellants think it's an in lieu tax."
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.964,1339.666,"No, but you see, our job is to try and make sense out of the entire statute."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1339.666,1339.883,I understand.
1986.85-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.737,1349.522,"Because you're being very literal here, because the words"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1358.645,1360.145,"That's right, yes."
1986.85-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.145,1367.501,"But maybe ""in lieu"" means that it's not an additional tax, but the only tax of a particular type."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1381.241,1387.462,"Well, yes, of course the Court can read that phrase any way it wants."
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.234,1417.482,"Supposing that South Dakota were a newly organized state and this was the first time they set out to tax anybody, and they said: We're going to tax all of you people on the traditional personal property tax, all of you commercial and business people, but we're not going to subject you airlines to that; we're going to have a special airlines tax for you, and we're going to use it all to fix up airports."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1421.885,1422.885,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.789,1438.728,"So but then you would agree, I take it, that the Supreme Court of South Dakota's opinion about what a lieu tax was is not entirely an accurate reflection of what Congress meant by the term?"
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1438.728,1447.25,"Well, as I understood the reasoning of the South Dakota Supreme Court, it was that it wasn't a tax that replaced any other tax, and therefore--"
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.25,1457.022,"Well, but your answer to the Chief Justice indicates that it doesn't have to replace another tax; it's enough if it's a tax that adjusts for the fact that you don't pay another one."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1485.008,1486.408,"--Sure, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.612,1492.495,All right.
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1492.495,1511.526,"There are really two issues that South Dakota has raised here in terms of legislative history, and it seems to me you have to look at the legislative history here, even if the South Dakota court did not do so."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.617,1604.453,"Before you go, can I ask one other question."
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1628.568,1633.686,"--The average rate, average tax rate for interstate airlines would have to be... excuse me."
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.59,1641.542,--The average rate applied to others?
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1641.542,1641.926,Yes.
1986.85-732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.926,1642.692,What does that mean?
1986.85-732,0,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,1648.28,1651.064,Lower courts have dealt with this at some length.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1676.346,1682.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.054,1796.006,"Yes, but if you ran a business and you used your airplane in your business, would that tax then be subject--"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1796.006,1799.874,"--Yes, it would, if I were a resident of South Dakota, four percent."
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.874,1800.074,--For commercial property?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1800.074,1802.41,"Paid only one time, Justice."
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.71,1877.172,"Well, but General Meierhenry, certainly the legislative history of this Act shows a legislative intent to prevent the state from taxing airlines or, in the case of railroads, railroads for ad valorem property tax purposes at a higher rate and putting them in a separate classification."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1886.195,1902.572,"Well, the thrust of the legislation, if I could be so bold as to put it in a sentence, was not to discriminate against interstate commerce and not to penalize in any way companies, like airlines, that operate interstate."
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.986,1940.197,"Well, if the state imposed a very small ad valorem property tax on private aircraft, for example, instead of none, the result here would have to be that the airlines could not be charged more than that, I guess."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1940.197,1940.747,That's correct.
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.747,1953.855,"But because the state charges zero ad valorem property taxes against private aircraft and other property, the result you argue for is that the tax stands."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1956.624,1966.849,"Well, I follow through in 1315(d), where it makes clear that states can have property taxes on interstate carriers."
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2030.755,2039.96,May I also ask you why you dropped the in lieu argument on your response in the appeal in this Court?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2039.96,2046.181,"Well, our trial court, as you're aware, found that it was an in lieu tax and our Supreme Court did not."
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.19,2062.024,"But you didn't make that argument, certainly."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2062.024,2063.976,"--No, we have not, because it was--"
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.976,2064.643,I just wondered why.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2064.643,2081.687,"--Well, it was our feeling that we had to take this case up under what our South Dakota Supreme Court's definition of in lieu tax was, and so we have done it that way, hoping that if we were incorrect this Court would correct that ruling by our court."
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.687,2091.726,But at least it was a statement by your court that the state hadn't intended to enact an in lieu tax?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2091.726,2102.268,"That's true, Your Honor, because part of the problem here is this was the initial approach at taxation of the airlines."
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.309,2158.771,"General Meierhenry, suppose your legislature, when it enacts a tax, says we do not... this is not an in lieu tax, we're not adopting this in order to replace something else, we just want to tax this business, and it says that in the statute."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2160.905,2164.924,"Well, yes, I think you can."
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.858,2172.262,What causes a tax to be in lieu unless the fact that it is imposed in lieu of something else?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2176.714,2178.666,"--I believe it does, Justice."
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.666,2182.634,So maybe that's why you didn't appeal the determination.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2188.87,2191.505,Yes.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.505,2194.674,What is it in lieu of?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2194.674,2196.524,It's in lieu of every other tax.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.578,2202.161,That's a very precise answer.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2203.863,2205.796,--But it is true.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.886,2217.587,What about all the trucks and things and all?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2218.622,2220.755,"--No, sir, they are not taxed."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2220.755,2223.991,You mean the trucks that run around the airport?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2223.991,2226.359,"No, we do not tax them."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.359,2230.263,"With ""Western Airlines"" on them; they aren't taxed?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2235.065,2238.501,"Yes, not in excess of perhaps $35."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.369,2241.153,A tax.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2241.153,2243.238,That would be the only other tax.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.659,2253.611,"If I could imagine that one, I bet you could imagine some others."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2253.611,2263.234,"Well, the fact of the matter is that airlines in South Dakota all use public facilities."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.486,2294.938,There's no personal property tax at all?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2294.938,2296.422,None.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.741,2302.709,"For the counters and all that stuff, you don't pay tax on that?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2302.709,2304.895,Not in South Dakota.
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.001,2315.953,But you pay fees?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2319.988,2321.94,"--Yes, they pay landing fees."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.94,2322.807,And fees to have a counter?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2322.807,2325.475,"Rent, yes."
1986.85-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.475,2328.594,The difference between a fee and a tax is?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2328.594,2331.796,"Well, there's a big difference between a fee and a tax."
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2460.459,2465.713,"General Meierhenry, could you focus down maybe on a specific example?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2478.872,2481.324,"Intrastate, in the state?"
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.324,2481.624,Yes.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2481.624,2484.193,They pay a four percent gross receipts tax.
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.193,2486.793,Do the airlines pay any gross receipts taxes?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2486.793,2490.18,"No, Congress has... the Aloha case has told us we cannot do that."
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.369,2501.719,Yes.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2501.719,2506.604,"They would pay the normal registration fees for a bus, which are very minimal."
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.238,2533.938,How about a gasoline tax?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2533.938,2537.023,"Yes, motor fuels tax in South Dakota."
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.395,2553.882,"If the airline buys fuel in South Dakota, it pays... in effect, it's charged for a tax, a fuel tax?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2553.882,2556.434,"--Yes, all of which under a statute--"
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.434,2559.553,But that's the same sort of tax that everybody else pays?
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2559.553,2559.903,--Yes.
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.628,2587.972,"But the airline... as far as you know, the airframes are the only kind of personal property that is subject to an ad valorem tax in South Dakota?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2587.972,2589.105,--That's correct.
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.741,2635.286,"Then in effect is the intrastate tour business in the Black Hills, it's paying a gross receipts tax that is probably as rough an equivalent or as much of an equivalent as you can say, as compared to the airlines tax on the airframe?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2635.286,2636.703,"Oh, far higher."
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.703,2643.642,"But I mean, that's the principal way the state gets money from each of those two businesses, is that right?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2643.642,2643.925,Yes.
1986.85-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.693,2681.514,"General, xxx on this airframe tax in lieu of a gross receipts tax which we know is invalid."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2681.514,2688.351,I suppose we could.
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.351,2711.533,"General Meierhenry, can I take xx back to the language of the statute for a minute and suggest to you that, just reading the statute literally, you probably can't collect this tax, because as I understand your argument the definitional section, ""subject to a property tax"", really has the effect of taking... saying these is no commercial and industrial property within the assessment jurisdiction."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2723.674,2730.364,"Well, that is of course this Court's duty, and I know a heavy responsibility, to determine this statute."
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.524,2773.09,"Well, I understand that."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2791.318,2793.937,"Well, other than other utilities."
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.053,2808.613,"And if that's true, then your ratio to market value is zero times market value, which produces zero, which would mean you can't tax above a zero rate if you just read the statute on its plain language."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2808.613,2816.351,"Well, on its face it has to be subject to a property tax before you go up to the ratio."
1986.85-732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.351,2817.986,Before you get out of the zero category.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2817.986,2818.653,That's right.
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.096,2839.465,"Well, why does that matter?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2878.387,2883.172,"Well, it's because of the whole way we come up with the ratio."
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.849,2904.169,"But would it violate the statute in a way that this act doesn't, and if so why?"
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2904.169,2922.916,"Because we would have to change how we come up with... I mean, we're talking about two different ratios, in effect, because our statute now requires us to take a ratio of the ton-miles they operate in our state, the flight time, and the total tonnage boarded and unloaded."
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.378,2943.746,"Oh, maximum assessment, fine."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2943.746,2944.113,All right.
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2944.113,2947.198,But then you can apply a 300 percent rate to this.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2947.198,2947.515,No.
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.067,2980.733,"As a matter of state law, you're saying."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2980.733,2981.533,As a matter of state law.
1986.85-732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.269,2985.221,Lucky for the Federal Government.
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2985.221,2994.66,"--Well, as a matter... but the federal law also, the purpose of the RRRR Act was to stop states from going overboard."
1986.85-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3020.644,3024.596,"Well, I'm not sure that's the question we have to ask."
1986.85-732,1,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3029.666,3033.535,"--Well, we do."
1986.85-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.891,3197.257,"Thank you, General Meierhenry."
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3200.057,3202.975,"Yes, just a couple of brief points."
1986.85-732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.069,3228.859,"Yes, but on that point, if I may add, isn't it true that with respect to all other taxes the revenues derived by those taxes go into the general revenue of the state, whereas this is the only tax where the money is earmarked for airport use?"
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3228.859,3231.061,"--That is true, although I think that's not really--"
1986.85-732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.061,3233.763,"Well, it makes some difference in the language, in the definition of in lieu tax."
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3233.763,3234.13,--If it were--
1986.85-732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.13,3238.584,What real estate do the airlines own that they pay taxes on?
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3238.584,3241.434,--I can't tell you a specific piece of real estate.
1986.85-732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.434,3242.952,Do you know that they have any specific piece?
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3242.952,3243.686,"No, I do not know."
1986.85-732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.904,3246.204,I'm sure.
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3248.856,3254.344,All I'm saying is that it's not... this tax is not in lieu of real estate taxes or any other taxes that the state imposes.
1986.85-732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.373,3307.228,Is there any other state that has a tax structure like this which happens to have no property tax and would be able to impose this kind of a system?
1986.85-732,2,40300,raymond_j_rasenberger,,3308.494,3310.513,"At this time, none that I can mention."
1986.85-732,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.25,3319.914,"Thank you, Mr. Rasenberger."
