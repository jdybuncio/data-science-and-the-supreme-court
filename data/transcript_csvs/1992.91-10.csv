1992.91-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.007,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-10, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. Shirley McQuillan."
1992.91-10,0,33352,james_d_vail,,58.821,70.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,993.02,1004.126,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.813,1159.568,When do you get to... when do you get to being guilty of an attempt but not monopolization?
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1159.568,1163.742,"--Well, when there's a dangerous probability of success."
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.708,1177.692,"And you just measure that by examining market power, is that it?"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1177.692,1183.217,"--Typically, we think you must define a relevant market and then make some--"
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.217,1185.539,And is intent irrelevant in the case or not?
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1185.539,1193.103,"--No, specific intent is also an element of attempt to monopolize, that's... that's clear from this Court's decisions."
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.103,1193.934,Uh-hum.
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1193.934,1199.869,"Aspen Skiing, Times-Picayune, Swift & Company, a number of this Court's decisions have held that specific intent--"
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.869,1207.646,"So at some time in this case it might be a dangerous possibility or probability, what is it?"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1207.646,1212.158,--Well the... the formulation in Swift & Company is dangerous probability.
1992.91-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.151,1222.044,"So at some... some time in this... on these... in this very situation, there might arise a dangerous probability."
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1222.044,1223.386,--In... yes.
1992.91-10,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1265.686,1283.617,"Mr. Long, if certain conduct would be held to be per se in violation of the Sherman Act, would an attempt to commit that act require the kind of proof you say it does here?"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1283.617,1285.879,"--Well, in our view--"
1992.91-10,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1285.879,1289.161,An attempt to commit a per se violation.
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1289.161,1290.483,--We don't think so.
1992.91-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.983,1328.82,"Mr. Long, do you have any other cases besides Swift where we've supposedly said that there's an... a separate dangerous probability?"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1358.94,1368.026,"That's true, although at the end of the opinion the Court added: Not every act that may be done with intent to produce an unlawful result is unlawful or constitutes an attempt."
1992.91-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.339,1383.557,"Plus proximity, okay."
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1390.523,1397.107,"--Well, a higher market share, in general, does indicate a greater probability of successful monopolization."
1992.91-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.716,1420.617,"Anyway, what... what's the other case you mentioned?"
1992.91-10,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1420.617,1422.587,The Walker Process case.
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1597.997,1607.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.453,1652.154,Did you allege a violation of section 1?
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1652.154,1661.249,"--We did, and there was a... a problem with the jury instruction, which is set forth in our brief, which we believe explains why the jury did not find liability under section 1."
1992.91-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.825,1702.969,"Well, that may be... that may be so, but if we were... if we insist on reviewing what the Ninth Circuit decided, are you defending it?"
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1702.969,1704.121,--I'm saying this.
1992.91-10,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.341,1720.894,"Well, Mr. Shohet, we granted certiorari to decide the question--"
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1720.894,1721.314,I understand.
1992.91-10,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.314,1722.236,--that was presented.
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1722.236,1722.947,Okay.
1992.91-10,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.947,1725.197,And we certainly want to hear you deal with that.
1992.91-10,2,32886,jeffrey_m_shohet,,1725.197,1725.388,I will.
1992.91-10,3,33352,james_d_vail,,3398.79,3399.49,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-10,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.491,3464.117,Do you agree that your instruction on conspiracy to monopolize that you tendered to the court did not require proof of a dangerous probability?
1992.91-10,3,33352,james_d_vail,,3464.117,3466.508,"Your Honor, I cannot answer the question."
1992.91-10,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.462,3475.766,"Well, what would you... just as a general matter, what would you think?"
1992.91-10,3,33352,james_d_vail,,3475.766,3487.835,"I think that it requires a conspiracy of more than one person agreeing that they are going to attempt to monopolize, and ought to have dangerous probability, require dangerous probability."
