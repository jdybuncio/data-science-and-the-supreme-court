1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,60.711,63.791,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.314,508.782,"I didn't quite follow your argument but I didn't read your Court of Appeals opinion is going quite that far, did you?"
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,508.782,509.101,Mr. Justice Stevens --
1978.78-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.101,512.135,(Voice Overlap) the word equal in that.
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,512.135,524.256,"Yes, they did, but I believe under these statutes you can read the word equal in such a way that it can apply to this and other sorts of laws."
1978.78-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.256,526.978,But does anybody ask us to do that?
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,526.978,537.0,"The Third Circuit's logic, I believe, compels the court to draw some sort of a line between what rights are assertable under 1985 (3)."
1978.78-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.0,550.59,"But what if we draw the line of to be the kind of thing that would be bad if it were done by a state agency in violation of Equal Protection Clause something like that, and that's sort of the thrust of what they say I think."
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,550.59,569.834,I'm not sure I read the Third Circuit's opinion to say that I see the logical thrust of the Third Circuit's opinion to reach any federal law that creates a right assertable in federal court in respect of whether it's otherwise assertable within the framework of that law.
1978.78-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.834,573.818,We realize the opinions here but we're passing on the judgments only.
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,573.818,576.941,"I understand, Your Honor."
1978.78-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.03,808.977,"Well, wouldn't the Third Circuit's answer to that be that with respect to all persons employed by employers are 15 or more persons, it is a right to equal treatment?"
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,808.977,828.051,"The Third Circuit may well say that but if we go a little bit farther in the language of the statute it says in order to assert a civil cause of action under 1985 (3), a person must be injured in his person, in his property, or deprived of a right of national citizenship."
1978.78-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.168,965.139,Two?
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,965.139,967.754,"At least two, Your Honor."
1978.78-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.754,972.014,I thought it was three or more (Inaudible)?
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,972.014,974.969,"Oh, with these (Inaudible) two would be fine, Your Honor."
1978.78-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,974.969,976.671,"Alright, I mean, it's not important to me I am --"

1978.78-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.514,979.631,(Inaudible)
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,979.631,993.329,We feel that the only sensible way to read laws within the meaning of 1985 (3) are laws creating right not otherwise assertable without 1985 (3).
1978.78-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.995,1081.658,Would you -- suppose you would have needed the 1985 (3) at all in the Griffin case against Breckenridge?
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,1095.878,1097.202,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1978.78-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.435,1111.499,"Well, I know it's not otherwise assertable."
1978.78-753,0,22039,eugene_k_connors,,1117.184,1119.781,That -- Bivens versus the Six Unknown Narcotics Agents?
1978.78-753,1,42037,stanley_m_stein,,1895.26,1898.862,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-753,2,22039,eugene_k_connors,,2566.651,2567.166,I'm sorry.
1978.78-753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2567.166,2569.138,You have your first signal.
1978.78-753,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.138,2570.123,It doesn't work.
1978.78-753,3,42037,stanley_m_stein,,2597.398,2606.418,I do not believe that I have to show the violation of Title VII to recover under 1985 (3).
1978.78-753,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2915.696,2920.582,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-753,5,42037,stanley_m_stein,,3059.456,3063.226,Is it also arguable if they were not employers within the meaning of the statute?
1978.78-753,6,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3063.226,3079.425,"Well, the statutory definition of employer in Title VII includes agent of the employer so that any place that the word employer or the word that the statutory definition of union is the same in Title VII."
1978.78-753,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3086.025,3094.468,"Since you're an amicus, Mr. Wallace I presume you're not entitled to enlarge your or subtract the issues in the case?"
1978.78-753,6,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3094.468,3101.333,"I assume so, Your -- Mr. Justice and we're not attempting to."
1978.78-753,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.796,3213.107,Of course --
1978.78-753,6,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3213.107,3213.86,As it --
1978.78-753,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.86,3215.441,-- it could (Voice Overlap) of Title VII?
