1969.540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.644,"Number 540, Rosado against Wyman and others."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,27.424,30.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.361,540.851,He compelled or the state would not be pleading simply to ignore the federal provision and except for nothing except for the laws of the federal system.
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,540.851,549.961,"Oh, I think a state in applying conditions in the AFDC title Mr. Justice Brennan certainly contemplate that the state may or may not participate in the program."
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.961,558.947,That's what probably about this case Mr. Albert and I don't quite understand that the only sanction is simply discontinuance in federal system.
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,563.769,570.903,"Mr. Justice Brennan, well this is a constitutional claim under the Supremacy Clause, I'm sorry Mr. Justice Brennan, it is a constitutional claim under the --"
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,570.903,576.289,"That means the federal statute, I gather would have to be controlling in front of the states, disregarding than that."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,576.289,582.46,Controlling only to the extent if the state participates in the federal program receives and uses --
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.46,593.495,"But if a state decides and says, “No, well we want no part of the federal system any longer.” and votes this constant argument and the other type charge will close it."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,593.495,603.565,On this aspect of the case most certainly so it is we aren't seeking to enforce one of the plan conditions that Congress has imposed in the received of federal moneys.
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,637.892,649.751,"Well, is it the ultimate source in the problem here is for provision that permits this kind of conflict of either one to be resolved in the first instance?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,655.151,667.84,"No, I think it's fair to characterize that Congress has given the Department of Health Education and Welfare the power to terminate federal funds upon finding a conflict between a state plan requirement and --"
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.84,672.278,Was it their procedure or an administered procedure for resolving this in the first place?
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,672.278,680.728,"There's no administrative procedure or proceeding Mr. Justice Brennan, there is this power in HEW which it may exercise."
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,687.763,697.09,There was a point we heard something of a contemplated conference or hearing or something on this very question that to have been scheduled on this case?
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,697.09,701.865,"Well, no different than any other the act contemplates or when a state makes a change in its AMTC."
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.865,706.958,"Well, was there anything scheduled between HEW and the state officials in this issue?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,706.958,711.326,"Well, it's not scheduled detour no Mr. Justice Brennan, I'll explain what did happened."
1969.540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.75,784.084,"Well, is this issue right for judicial decision until that procedure is been completed?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,784.084,798.078,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan it's our view that the delegation to HEW with the power to cut off federal funds does not preclude the remedy that this Court upheld in King against Smith."
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.417,856.819,"Except that the HEW hasn't addressed itself to one or two of the critical issues, doesn't report to be answering them?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,856.819,863.713,"All right, it doesn't and the HEW was invited to participate in this case amicus at the beginning."
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.713,877.63,But it says in its brief in this Court that it doesn't purport to be telling us whether it's just the streamlining of the state standard or on the other hand it's forbidden as an impressible reduction in the confidence standards.
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,880.884,882.165,That's one of the critical issues Mr. Justice White.
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.165,885.947,"Well, it says on that and apparently it hasn't devised anyone on that yet."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,885.947,896.654,"That's quite often the case Mr. Justice White, it didn't really advice the Court, for example it did not advice the Court or anyone else in King against Smith exactly what its position on substitute for the rules were."
1969.540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,896.762,899.092,"Maybe -- maybe, they didn't ready to do so yet?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,899.092,910.178,"It had -- Mr. Chief Justice, it's certainly the meandering or long protracted serious in negotiations or very indefinite negotiations certainly is a characteristic of that process."
1969.540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.404,932.596,Are you suggesting that there's a burden on the courts to package the administrative function is delayed or --
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,932.596,933.422,"Not at all Mr. Chief Justice, I merely --"
1969.540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,933.422,934.774,-- not as feeble as it might be?
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,934.774,935.485,"No, I'm sorry."
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.194,1039.786,"But we Mr. Albert, we'll have to--that issue that I have referred to a moment ago certainly has to be decided in this case if we get to the merits."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,1051.824,1054.152,"Mr. Justice White, I fought them in this case."
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.132,1071.415,"Well that may be so, but then you have to make it to state statute against, and the argument is that the state statute is consistent."
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,1071.415,1074.732,"Mr. Justice White, I'm going to address myself to that certainly I just wanted to make--"
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.732,1076.536,"We'll have to decide that issue wouldn't we, without any --?"
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,1076.536,1078.478,I believed that's correct Mr. Justice White.
1969.540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.478,1083.423,Without -- without the HEW or the government having stated what if thought at all?
1969.540,0,34069,lee_a_albert,,1083.423,1099.128,"For one reason or another, the government did volunteer brief in this Court very recently and mentions a few hints of something right or wrong, it doesn't want to take the position on the merits for one reason or another."
1969.540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1608.769,1611.702,Very well Mr. Albert.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1614.494,1617.25,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.766,1731.657,"Well, there wasn't a decision of King against Smith, wasn't it?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1731.657,1740.447,"No, but there was a long history of acquiescence which this Court said was tantamount a decision and that it got HEW out of the way in effect."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.856,1756.607,"Well, the Court in King against Smith specifically said that there was a correspondence going on and then said it on page 326, “Additional correspondent ensued with HEW never approved deregulation.”"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1756.607,1768.814,"That's right Justice White but by letting it sit on the desk so to speak for 20 years and many other states might just Alabama had that provision, I believe more than half of the states had it."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.563,1802.053,I take it there has been correspondence going on between New York departments.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1802.053,1802.5,"Yes, indeed."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.5,1808.284,And this was -- did Mr. Albert practically describe what's happened so far?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1808.284,1809.096,"Yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.163,1824.738,"Now, let's assume HEW decided that what the New York has done is quite consistent with that Section 43 or whatever it is. Would they say so or would they just not or they just be quiet."
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1824.738,1824.879,Well. I think --
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.879,1826.722,They'll write you a letter to say we approve it or we --
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1826.722,1846.35,"I'm -- I'm sure they would because they've already questioned other aspect which are unrelated to this case of the New York Statutes and in the past they've given specific approval to the actions of New York and I have to assume the other states as well so that I'm confident if they no objections at 131 (a), the New York Statute, they would say so."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.217,1880.748,"But if they have and if they did say, do they usually just say yes if they say, yes, and yes because and say why they think its good?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1880.748,1882.073,"Oh -- oh, the letter Justice White?"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.467,2097.332,But as it has in New York in one of those states that all in said that one point to sets of standards in need and that's the actual payment?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2097.332,2098.282,"Yes, indeed."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.282,2099.351,"And it's still is, isn't?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2099.351,2103.831,"Yes, there's no family maximum, there's no percentage of payment that needs such as many states have."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.831,2106.981,"So, when you set a standard of need, you purport to fulfill it in full?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2106.981,2107.681,"Yes, indeed."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.313,2117.617,So the 131 was then a change in the standard of need as well as the actual payment?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2117.617,2119.329,In 131 (a) Your Honor?
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.319,2135.661,If they change any?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2135.661,2138.471,New York pays 100% of the standard of need.
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.733,2347.797,"Well, what was special with all the special grants?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2347.797,2349.87,Special grants go through as specific items such as --
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2349.87,2350.797,For example.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2350.797,2360.566,"-- moving expenses Justice Brennan, a diet through somebody who's diabetic let's say or something needs special diet, MIETS for infants, things of that nature."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2360.566,2364.425,"And now, these things were eliminated is that in the computation of the gross payment?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2364.425,2388.319,They were eliminated but they're still available to the welfare recipient personally because the figure of $25.00 per month was tacked on to the average in 1969 in order to compensate for the elimination of special grants and also because many of these items such as moving in a security deposit for an apartment rental and that's necessary are now available through a purchase of services which is over and above the allowance.
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.693,2426.485,"But, I gather basically on the question of a conflict through the federal regulation you'd say that it's been no change in the standard of need period because these special grants were an addition to the chance?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2426.485,2426.829,"Yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2426.829,2427.556,Standard need.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2427.556,2428.525,"Yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2433.591,2440.515,Why -- why is it you suppose HEW tells us their not going to advise us whether they think you're right or wrong about that proposition?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2440.515,2446.144,"Well, I guess they haven't looked into the question fully enough and exhaustedly enough to make up their minds yet."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.089,2458.311,"I just wonder how much looking into it takes to discover that in fact the special services are still available in the different form, how much times does that take?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2458.311,2467.096,"Pardon me Justice Brennan, I don't know how long it takes but I would say this, the statute was only enacted in April, it was then amended in May."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2472.267,2477.117,"Now, some of these correspondents between you and HEW touch the subject a notice --"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2477.117,2477.635,"Yes, indeed."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2477.794,2481.094,This noted November 10 is nothing whatever to do with those things?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2481.094,2488.455,"No, that particular letter doesn't but the very note of the correspondents back and forth which appears in the appendix is just exactly that question."
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2488.455,2490.117,In which appendix is your or?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2490.117,2491.97,"Well, that's a joint appendix it's the petitioner's --"
1969.540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.97,2492.524,"Oh, yes."
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2492.524,2505.835,"It's a letter by a Mr. Collison who's the regional director I believe, his title as an HEW, anyway he's the man whose got jurisdiction over this and has been constant correspondents back and forth dealing with these very questions."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.882,2595.496,"Well, what was the major purpose on 131 (a)?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2606.143,2609.67,"Well it was, Justice White it was streamlining in the elimination of the average --"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.67,2612.359,"I know it's streamlining, but what does streamlining mean?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2612.359,2614.565,"Getting to that, it was the basically two things."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.362,2655.92,"In short, you don't determine individual need?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2655.92,2681.365,"Well, we still determine individual needs but we do it under a formula which was simplified in no way reduced but simplified so that how much family afford gets now doesn't depend on whether the oldest child in that family is 9 or 11 or 13, it now depends on --it is now a set amount for a family of four with a difference between New York City and the rest of the state which isn't involved in this case, that's the proportion of this case that mooted out and which --"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.365,2683.199,That simplifies the administration?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2683.199,2685.157,"Yes, yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2863.464,2874.968,"In effect, Congress was indicating that it would review from time to time a need for updating, is that a fair analysis of that provision?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2874.968,2885.629,"Presumably they would, but whatever they might be planning to do in the future and of course since then as the Court knows, there's been many proposals which will change the whole field of welfare around."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.058,2927.289,"Do you say Mr. Weinberg, New York's position is that it did the one-shot updating or did not have to was already updated, which?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2927.289,2927.871,"No, we did it."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.596,2933.359,In -- in response to the 67 legislation?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2933.359,2936.368,"Well, we would have done it anyway because all statute requires that in any of that we certainly --"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.368,2942.854,"Well, what I'm trying to get at it, under 131 (a), did you have to do the updating anyway under your own state law?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2942.854,2943.351,"Yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.351,2943.827,You did?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2943.827,2944.055,"Yes, indeed."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.055,2952.726,"And so what you did, in compliance with your own state law and not necessarily in compliance with the new federal statute, is that it?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,2952.726,2953.218,"No, sir."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.665,3104.761,Is that necessary Mr. Weinberg?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3112.361,3115.069,"Well, that's all -- They asked me --"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.069,3120.87,"-- declaratory -- if we were to say there was a conflict, would we declare more than that?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3135.107,3135.369,"Well, sir the petitioner --"
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.369,3136.958,Why would we ask to order it?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3136.958,3139.308,The petitioners are asking for a great deal more than they're asking for injunction.
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.308,3143.854,They maybe asking for it but does it follow?
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3143.854,3147.17,I don't believe it does. I think the injunction which is what this Court of Appeals said would be --
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.17,3154.491,But you can't say “I should think you can argue that if they're right that they're entitled on a relief whatever?”
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3154.491,3154.656,Well --
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.656,3160.403,We could still give them declaratory judgement I suppose within the framework of what they're asking for.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3160.403,3167.524,But declaratory judgement would still be in effect in order or it wouldn't be an injunction but it would be virtually in order compelling the state legislature appropriate for money.
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.524,3170.871,"I suggest control the ball in the HEW alley, that's where it belongs anyway I guess?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3170.871,3176.27,"That's what we've been insisted throughout the whole litigation, no question about it."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.48,3194.103,"Well, what if the HEW had approved, actually approved your present plan?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3194.103,3195.998,Then that would eliminate the unripeness aspect of this case.
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.998,3201.743,"All right, then you were standing here, let's assume right now HEW had approved this."
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3204.089,3207.542,"Well, that's still be the basic question that whether the Court had jurisdiction which I'd like to get to admit it."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.542,3210.265,"That's what I would like to said that, but assumed jurisdiction?"
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3210.265,3214.539,"Assumed -- not just on the unripeness, Justice White, but also on other questions."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.539,3215.384,I understand that.
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3215.384,3245.802,"But assuming that the Court had jurisdiction, assuming it were right by HEW passing on it, that would bring and assuming that you would prepare to rule that New York didn't comply, that would bring us up to the question, I was just starting to address myself to, could the Court order in effect whether by declaratory judgement or injunction, could the Court order the New York legislature disperse additional money for welfare without violating the Eleventh Amendment and a whole volume of case law which we've cited in our brief."
1969.540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.774,3263.461,"Well, you got some other type of questions on some other points on that one."
1969.540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.461,3264.58,"Yes, and you have just four minutes away."
1969.540,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,3264.58,3265.715,"Yes, sir."
1969.540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3440.227,3442.713,"Mr. Albert, you have three minutes left."
1969.540,2,34069,lee_a_albert,,3442.713,3443.829,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.540,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3632.101,3633.272,"Thank you, Mr. Albert."
