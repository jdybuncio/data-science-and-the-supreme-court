1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.743,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-854, Spallone v. United States; 88-856, Chema against the United States; 88-870, Longo and Fagan against the United States."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,27.818,31.082,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.822,104.194,"You think the... you're arguing for legislative immunity, local legislative immunity?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,104.194,114.346,"As well as First Amendment, Your Honor, and the discretion inherent in the Court to fashion a constitutional remedy and the limitations on the Court in fashioning such a remedy."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,114.346,117.079,Do you think you need all of those?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,117.079,119.501,We think the Court could--
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.501,120.593,What about just the immunity question?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,120.593,124.28,"--We think the Court could decide this on that basis, yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,124.28,126.842,"Well, is that constitutionally based?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,126.842,128.294,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.294,135.134,"So, it is just a construction of some other federal statute, 1983?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,135.134,138.226,It's... it's based upon federal common law as--
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,138.226,143.13,Which some statute wasn't intended to interfere with?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,143.13,146.332,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.332,153.377,"So, Congress could deprive the legislators of their common-law immunity?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,153.377,156.86,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.124,165.013,"Well, if that is all it is, then can Congress change that?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,165.013,167.59,"--It, it, it cannot, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.086,185.161,"So, you are relying on a constitutional basis, not merely a common law immunity?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,185.161,187.067,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.067,188.628,You are relying on the guarantee clause?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,188.628,202.872,"Yes, Your Honor, although the cases, both Tenney and Lake Tahoe Estates, do not... explain in any detail the extent to which Congress could interfere with the operation of legislative immunity."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.633,223.536,"Well, why do you need to get into that rather difficult question in this case, Mr. Harmon, if, if your argument is basically legislative immunity?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,237.407,248.48,"--Well, I think I as best I could was answering the question about whether or not Congress could intervene, and in, in answering the question I was giving our position in the event that Congress had... has intervened."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.575,364.917,"Do you think that legislators, if they enjoy immunity, can waive it?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,364.917,370.742,"The government has made no effort to argue that in its, in its brief."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.742,376.254,"Well, I asked you whether you thought it could be waived if there is such a privilege?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,376.254,381.175,The answer is we do not believe that an individual legislator can waive the privilege.
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.104,409.071,"What is the effect, then, of the city council approving the consent decree?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,409.071,418.394,It has no effect whatsoever on the rights and immunities of any of the individual councilmen.
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.371,441.556,Does the city yet have the 800 housing units and a zoning plan to accommodate them?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,443.447,449.711,"No, there have been no developers even selected yet for the 800 affordable housing units, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.711,452.163,And how's the Court to go about this?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,455.925,462.017,"Well, I, I, I'd suggest to you that we are... I am not standing up here as any kind of a Monday morning quarterback."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.992,492.365,"Well, can the district court just impose that on the city?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,492.365,494.349,"In, in, in fact, and I--"
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,494.349,495.457,Yes or no?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,495.457,495.785,--Yes.
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.785,500.066,And that is not more intrusive?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,500.066,503.345,"It can do it to this extent, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.383,564.429,xxx immunity?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,564.429,565.429,"--Nor immunity, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.195,603.929,What about raising the money?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,617.753,618.566,"Well, in, in this particular case--"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.566,620.845,--and then order the executive branch to carry it out?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,620.845,626.249,"--In, in this particular case, Your Honor, the, the question of cost has not yet arisen."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.981,630.044,But it will.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,631.402,641.961,"It is... there is a difference between directing an executive act, in our opinion, and, and directing an act which is purely legislative."
1989.88-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.714,682.491,"How is the court going to effectively produce the money to get the houses built, the housing built?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,682.491,691.582,"In, in this particular case there is a combination of market incentives encouraging developers to come in and granting tax abatements."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.767,700.516,"Well, I suppose there is some... there are some things that maybe a court just cannot bring about."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,700.516,716.462,"We think that the court's power is limited by the constitutional grant of its power, and it is the responsibility of courts to, to say what the law is, and to levy a tax is not an exercise of, of the judicial power."
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.196,731.097,"Well, if, if, if you stipulate that the city has violated the Constitution, would you say that the court can use all appropriate means to require the city to remedy that violation?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,731.097,740.765,"All appropriate means within its power, taking into account the rights of persons who are not before the court."
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,740.765,741.046,All right.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,762.022,768.082,"We, we, we would suggest that the contempt power be a, a matter of last resort, and that there would be some--"
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.082,773.407,"Fut that that would be appropriate, monetary fine, as was imposed in this case against the city?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,773.407,774.376,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.376,775.907,"Then, if you--"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,777.048,778.749,"But not against the individual, right."
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.749,794.447,"Then what you are really arguing, if you have recalcitrant councilmen who, let us assume, it may not be this case, for their own political advantage, refuse to comply with the court order, you are saying that there is a right in the city councilmen to force the city to go bankrupt?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,794.447,810.096,"There is a, a right in councilmen to exercise their judgment, to take into account the wishes of their constituents, to take into account their own... their own conscience--"
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.096,812.517,And to force the city to go bankrupt if that is what they conclude?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,812.517,816.719,"--Yes, and to be held accountable for that at the ballot box, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.719,826.792,"I have some trouble with looking to the wishes of the constituents, because it seems to me the basic issue in the case is whether the court can order something the constituents don't want."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,834.93,837.913,That is--
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.913,841.895,How can we use the constituents as the test of what can be permitted?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,841.895,849.86,"--Well, we don't suggest for, for a minute that there is a question of majoritarianism here, that the majority... that the majority should rule, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.403,864.995,"Even when it violates a, a superior federal law."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,876.35,888.127,"--Well, we respectfully suggest that that is precisely the problem that has been posed here by the district court, that this Court is being put in the position of deciding which, which rights should be superior."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.127,896.139,But aren't you... don't you start here from the premise that there is a federal violation that the court has the power by appropriate means to correct?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,896.139,897.811,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.811,901.215,Notwithstanding the fact that the constituents are very much opposed to it.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,901.215,902.855,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.855,908.729,So don't... aren't the views of the constituents necessarily subordinate to the court's power to fashion an appropriate remedy?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,911.602,928.126,"Well, they may... they may be subordinate, Your Honor, but we, as we pointed out in our brief, we... we'd suggest that the views of the constituents, since this was a class action, were views that should have been brought to the attention of the district court."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.227,968.078,"Mr. Harmon, I have some, some misgivings about... extending the speech or debate clause in the federal Constitution, not only to state legislatures but even to state, city councils."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1009.124,1012.669,It protects the state government's choice of... choice of form of government.
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.807,1024.54,"No, but you are arguing on the base of federal Constitution here."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1040.909,1043.907,"--No, Your Honor, we would--"
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.907,1045.875,"Well, then you are not arguing the speech or debate clause."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1052.779,1059.355,"--It's... it's... it's Article 3, which says that the courts have judicial power."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.212,1064.322,Yes.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1072.194,1081.346,We do not argue that immunity under the speech or debate clause should be extended to local legislators.
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.233,1092.013,"--Well, well, put it this way."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1110.131,1118.331,"We would have had a constitutional claim based upon the New York State Constitution, and the arguments would have been--"
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1118.331,1119.378,Of course you wouldn't.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1123.532,1128.201,"--Under the... under the First Amendment, yes."
1989.88-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.201,1130.106,Only the First Amendment?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1130.106,1135.183,"Yes, but not under the... not under the principle of legislative immunity."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.183,1146.163,"But if you rely only on the First Amendment, supposing it were not a governmental agency but a private corporation that had been ordered to merge or divest itself of certain investments or something like that."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1153.833,1156.924,"Yes, we, we, we think he would have."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.75,1166.06,You're talking about a vote.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1175.869,1176.307,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.307,1187.428,And I don't know why that speech is any different than the director of a private corporation who doesn't want to divest itself of its holdings in South African companies or something like that.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1193.066,1201.625,"Well, there is a question of balancing, and there is a question of a compelling governmental interest in that particular, in that particular instance."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.355,1213.057,"Well, where do we get the First Amendment right from, Mr. Harmon?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1230.409,1234.268,It is a form of political expression.
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.48,1255.899,"Well, it may be a fundamental act of democracy, but that does not by itself demonstrate that it's... it's speech."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1281.593,1286.592,"Well, that is not clear in the record, those, those particular events, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.592,1291.448,"Well, I know, but everybody seems to agree that the city was bound, and you agree it was bound."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1291.448,1292.479,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.479,1295.633,"And, so it was... how, how was it supposed to act?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1295.633,1304.598,"Well, it was... it was bound to this extent, concerning the legislative action that was called for in the, in the consent decree."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.857,1335.586,"Well, you say... you say the city could be fined for not living up to its consent, don't you?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1335.586,1340.974,"Our position here is in representing the... individual councilmen, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.878,1353.704,You don't think the members of the council owed any duty at all to... to do what the city had promised to do?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1353.704,1361.154,"I think perhaps the, the, the city was ill advised here in entering into a--"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.154,1362.716,"I know, but that isn't answering my question."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1370.227,1378.007,"--There was no legal obligation to do that, insofar as the enactment of legislation was, was called for."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1378.007,1385.3,Had there been any change in the membership of the council between the time of the city's agreement to the consent decree and the time of these particular votes?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1385.3,1386.581,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1386.581,1393.187,"And these councilmen were the ones who voted for the consent decree, were they not?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1394.219,1395.156,Two of them were.
1989.88-854,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1396.015,1397.311,Two of them.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1398.53,1399.841,"Two of them voted against it, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.841,1402.84,"And are you representing them, too, or do they have different counsel here?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1402.84,1407.526,I represent... I am counsel of record for all councilmen for purposes of oral argument.
1989.88-854,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1436.139,1438.607,"What do your words ""in the first instance"" mean?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1438.607,1445.823,"--That means at the time that they voted against the consent decree, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1445.823,1447.494,"Well, what did they do in the second instance?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1448.729,1460.239,"Well, there was one later, later on after this court denied the stay to the city and granted the stay to the individual councilmen."
1989.88-854,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1482.746,1490.072,So he did feel an obligation to carry out what the city had promised to do.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1490.072,1492.413,"Well, I think he--"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.413,1493.537,"Well, anyway, he did it."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1493.537,1494.334,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-854,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1494.334,1496.411,Was that your client or someone else's?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1496.411,1498.114,"That was my client, Justice, yes."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.114,1506.814,"Of course, to the extent it is a First Amendment right you are relying on, you, you are not asserting that that is not waivable, are you?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1506.814,1527.727,"Again, that is not an issue that has been presented by the, by the government, but it would be our position that, in this particular instance, the First Amendment act of voting by an elected legislature in favor of legislation is not waivable."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.678,1538.894,"Is... is this like the court ordering somebody to say something he didn't, doesn't want to say?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1550.921,1557.231,"Well, that we submit is an executive type of function and it does not--"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.231,1568.461,"Well, it is because the... the... the employer has been found to have violated a law and they want to... and, and the agency wants to provide a remedy, and they say post this notice."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1568.461,1580.987,"--Well, it, It also does not require, and we question whether anything in the Constitution permits a court to compel someone to publicly--"
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.987,1591.076,"The employer, it won't do the employer any good these days to say the First Amendment protects me, I have freedom of speech, why should they be able to order me to say something I don't want to say?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1591.076,1598.777,"--Well, there is a question of the competing governmental interest on one side as opposed... as opposed to the other."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.777,1607.711,"Are you willing to apply that here in the First Amendment, on your First Amendment argument, weighing, weighing the governmental interests against the private interests?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1607.711,1609.116,"Yes, we are willing, we are willing to do that, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.95,1640.338,"xxx said, well, just to make it clear I am going to draft... redraft the ordinance."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1645.461,1648.287,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I didn't understand that."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.287,1656.768,"Well, wouldn't, wouldn't the court have, have had to redraft the zoning... the existing zoning ordinance so everybody would know what the law is?"
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1656.768,1659.579,That is not what the district court did in this case.
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.579,1666.406,"I know, but you say that was an alternative, a less intrusive alternative."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1666.406,1667.156,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.156,1670.872,But it would have involved redrafting the zoning ordinance.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1670.872,1675.386,"It, it would not have required a redrafting of the zoning ordinance."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.421,1767.412,"Your argument sounds as though it is, it's... it's... you could make just as strong an argument of saying this is just a matter of equity; this is just a matter of equitable principles applying to what remedy a court could, could issue, without even raising any constitutional issue."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1767.412,1778.845,"The constitutional issue is, is raised by the fact that there is a, a proven constitutional violation, that the court is exercising its authority to remedy that violation."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.186,1790.45,"Well, that is a matter of equity, certainly."
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1793.355,1800.431,"--And that, in general, is our position."
1989.88-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.378,1816.425,--But it would be okay if they were needfully intruded upon?
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1822.686,1832.183,"In this, in this particular case the court had an alternative, a specific alternative which, which it could have used and which it did use in the past."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.129,1856.829,xxx in your argument you could say normally you don't impose contempt except to the... as a last resort.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1856.829,1858.157,"We agree with that, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.157,1860.047,And that is not a constitutional argument.
1989.88-854,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1862.218,1872.775,"We agree that the court could resolve the case on the basis of the contempt power and the court's supervisory authority over the, over the exercise of the contempt power."
1989.88-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.744,1877.087,"Thank you, Mr. Harmon, your time is expired."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1879.477,1883.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.57,2038.443,"Has the judge now done that, though, to a degree?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2038.443,2045.081,"--He has done it with respect, Justice O'Connor, to specific sites in the public housing arena."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2161.737,2164.674,"This was after the, after the consent decree had been entered?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2164.674,2165.876,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.948,2181.917,Were the city councilmen represented personally in that colloquy?
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2181.917,2195.833,"They were not in that colloquy, but the attorney for the city, Justice Kennedy, represented that he was, in fact, conveying to the court the strongly felt views of the city council."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.095,2214.808,"Are, are you saying that that colloquy and the rest of the proceedings in the district court are tantamount to a finding that all other remedies were inadequate?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2214.808,2248.765,"Well, I think this judge reached the stage where he determined that there had to be obedience to law, and that any other remedy was, in fact, unduly intrusive with respect to principles of federalism and comity that this Court has mentioned and emphasized time and again... Rizzo against Goode, Milliken v. Bradley One... concerns about unnecessarily stripping the elected authorities of their power."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.806,2274.097,"General Starr, your opponent made the statement in his argument that no federal court has ever before required legislators to... cast their votes in a particular way."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2282.361,2304.272,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, at pages 30 to 32 of our brief we enumerate a number of cases arising under the contract clause that go back to the mid-19th century, where federal courts, affirmed by this Court, directed local legislative bodies to take specific action to levy a tax increase."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.535,2317.174,"--That is dicta though, in the Griffin case."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2317.174,2322.422,"--My brethren would agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.425,2361.343,"That would convert a great deal of dicta into holding, if everything a court says that might be done in a case be... becomes a holding."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2366.67,2371.762,"--I do not quarrel that it was not the holding in the, in the case, Mr. Chief Justice, but--"
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.762,2373.746,xxx do you mean holding in dicta now?
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2375.541,2391.41,"--I would... I, I would certainly say that if the court has given guidance to a district judge as to what can be done, that that guidance should be taken very respectfully and very seriously."
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.41,2404.232,"Well, that may be, but of course, in that case the... it didn't really say that legislators could be required to vote for any specific piece of legislation."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2409.887,2410.574,That is true.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.574,2414.135,"So they could have done that in all sorts of ways, I suppose."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2414.135,2424.896,"Well, it was a bit more... I don't dwell on that one sentence, but it was rather specific, Justice White, with respect to directing them to levy a tax increase."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.816,2480.202,But now does... does that plan... when a court says that under their... Voting Rights Act this plan is going to obtain at least temporary... does that require enactment by the legislative body?
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2480.202,2482.919,--In that instance it does not.
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.434,2485.403,"Well, then that isn't a very good example, is it?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2485.403,2486.98,"--by, by the court."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.762,2489.527,"That isn't a very good example, is it?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2489.527,2490.463,--It is not a particularly good.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.396,2507.129,That's... that's more like... if the court here had said I deem this legislation to be in effect.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2511.283,2514.844,"I, I would respectfully disagree with that."
1989.88-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2627.235,2637.231,"Well, General Starr, I guess no one here is disputing that the court can do something to compel compliance."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2662.675,2673.029,"Well, if I may, the authorities I would principally rely upon are the authorities from the 19th century and the early 20th century, which in case--"
1989.88-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2673.029,2678.917,"Was there a claim there, to your knowledge, of legislative immunity that was asserted?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2678.917,2680.105,--There was none.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.561,2715.591,"Can we order Congress to enact a statute, General Starr?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2715.591,2719.886,We could not by... the courts could not by virtue of the speech or debate clause.
1989.88-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2719.886,2722.245,Do you think the court--
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2732.38,2732.599,All right.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.861,2745.687,Suppose the speech or debate clause didn't exist.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2753.747,2754.966,Absolutely not.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.966,2756.621,You think the separation of powers--
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2756.621,2764.492,The separation of powers concerns would be grave by the judiciary directing a coordinate branch to take a specific action.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.849,2799.743,"--One, one last step, it, it... you know, they refer to the unification of two powers within one branch is the definition of tyranny, you think it would be okay for the court to unite within itself judicial and legislative powers where those legislative powers are federal, but it would be okay for a court to unite within itself judicial and legislative powers, so long as those legislative powers are only state legislative powers--"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2799.743,2800.868,--I think to--
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.868,2802.789,--which are probably more extensive than federal legislative powers.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2802.789,2804.445,"--to the contrary, again."
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.445,2806.46,"Doesn't that scare you a little bit, too?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2806.46,2810.053,It gives me great pause because of principles of federalism.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.137,2835.137,I am not worried about federalism.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2845.368,2874.278,"It is more troubling and it is, indeed, in this case, one of the reasons that the district court said instead of my acting as a legislature as they now suggest he should have done, he said instead I am going to use a traditional power, the contempt power, to enforce an obligation and which will, in fact, result in no restructuring whatsoever of the local governmental apparatus in Yonkers."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2913.588,2932.239,"Well, if we concede, General Starr, that the Constitution of the United States, because of its separation of powers scheme would prevent our ordering Congress from voting for a certain act, that is not because it is just a quirk of the constitutional structure."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2958.493,2967.005,"Justice Kennedy, those concerns are in fact raised by Mr. Harmon's suggestion as to what the court should have done."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2974.113,2984.078,"But if, if that had happened the record at least would have been clear as to how the legislation was created, what its authority was, what its source was."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3003.193,3010.691,"--Justice Kennedy, I think the court of appeals responded to that concern, although not in those terms."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3032.011,3035.524,But it is a charade because the outcome is foreclosed.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3035.524,3058.78,"--The outcome in a broad sense is foreclosed with respect to the requirement to enact an ordinance that accomplishes what Part 6 of the Housing Remedy Order and Section 17 of the consent decree... remember, the consent decree was final, they sought to vacate it, that motion was denied."
1989.88-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3062.607,3077.04,"I just can't understand how it's giving greater latitude to the council to send it back to them, telling them how to vote than it is to go ahead and put it into effect."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3079.695,3090.362,It means by virtue of what the court did that it did not raise those profound questions of the nature of the power that is being exercised.
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3127.519,3130.331,So long as it reaches a foreordained outcome.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3130.331,3139.28,"--Foreordained in the sense, I must agree with that, with respect to enacting an ordinance that fulfills the purposes of the consent decree."
1989.88-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3165.769,3168.377,"Well, I suppose that option is always open to them."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3168.377,3174.359,"--That option is, indeed, always open to them, but they have not sought to avail themselves of that option."
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.359,3187.385,"I take it the liability of the city and the contempt against the city is a fore... foregone conclusion, that the city's liability is settled, is that it?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3187.385,3187.9,That is true.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.9,3198.054,"And of course, the running fine against the city put unbearable pressure on the city council, I suppose."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3200.646,3202.176,That is true.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.176,3209.22,"And I suppose that, that... that, is arguably in your favor, I suppose."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3209.22,3211.812,"Well, I would think it is in my favor."
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3265.213,3271.554,"Doesn't a court have to say once in a great while, Mr. Starr, this is just... we can't bite off that much?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3297.434,3299.527,"--Well, in this instance--"
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.527,3311.648,"Or does it not say that there are some cases he is going to stop short and say the powers of the... the equitable powers of this Court just do not encompass going that far, even though we cannot fully remedy the, the violation?"
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3311.648,3317.129,--I think the principles of equity constantly must guide the judge.
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.459,3354.724,"Fiat justitia, ruat coelum."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3357.926,3358.253,--I beg your pardon?
1989.88-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.753,3362.298,"--Let there be justice, though the heavens fall."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3362.298,3363.408,Not at all.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.011,3395.988,"I take it you would say that if this... if the remedy that the judge employed is beyond the power of a court, or it shouldn't be... he shouldn't have issued that kind of remedy, that then the enacting of an ordinance should also be beyond the power."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3395.988,3397.035,Quite right.
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3411.934,3413.528,He didn't have to enact an ordinance.
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3439.471,3448.545,"--Mr. Harmon would have you believe that the only ordinance of concern was the zoning ordinance; that... that's, with all respect, completely wrong."
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3468.833,3475.566,What... what was the... what was Yonkers doing that was unconstitutional and which this was remedying?

1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3517.407,3523.139,"It is complicated stuff, but, but the only, the only whip that the city had over the whole thing was the zoning."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3538.601,3539.461,I have to disagree.
1989.88-854,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.143,3557.329,Tax incentives... tax incentives included?
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3557.329,3566.482,"--There were tax incentives, tax abatements, and the like, but there were a series of, the term used in Section 17 is mandated incentives."
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3569.434,3571.869,"Well, that may well be, but that was not unconstitutional."

1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3587.614,3589.909,"Oh, I am sure you have, but that is the problem."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3589.909,3598.64,"No, the point that I have moved to is the capacity of the court to enforce an obligation, a decree."
1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3620.304,3636.922,"All right, but at this stage we are no longer talking about the glorious enforcement of the Constitution by a district court, but we are simply talking about how far a district court can go in order to enforce, enforce an agreement that isn't required by the Constitution."

1989.88-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3642.857,3658.241,"It may be, but if you don't enforce it to the hilt, and if you say gee, our powers just don't enable us to enforce it to the hilt, the conclusion you come to is not, and therefore the constitutional violation must endure, which is a scary conclusion ever to have to come to."
1989.88-854,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3679.046,3686.152,"--The zoning ordinance, I, I, I hate to be stubborn on the point, but it wasn't the zoning ordinance that was unconstitutional."
