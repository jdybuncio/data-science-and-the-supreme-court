2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.447,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-674, NRG Power Marketing v. Maine Public Utilities Commission."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,9.823,18.29,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a bedrock principle of Federal -- Federal energy law, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine."
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,33.485,37.123,Does it matter who is the challenger?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,56.227,63.784,"--Your Honor, I represent -- we represent -- I represent NRG, which entered into the settlement agreement and is -- would like to be bound by the results of the auction contract."
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,73.17,76.856,So aren't you in a different position than those other challengers?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,76.856,79.68,"We certainly are in a different position, but they--"
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.68,84.039,So why doesn't that difference do what the D.C. Circuit said?
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.039,85.895,"Mr. Lamken, you're not a challenger?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,85.895,87.626,--That's exactly right.
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.626,87.86,Yes.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,88.063,88.593,We are not a challenger.
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.796,90.185,--the question relates to the other side--
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,90.185,90.512,--Right.
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.512,91.982,--not to his side--
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,91.982,93.729,No.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,111.69,112.096,Right.
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.968,152.861,So then does that bind all types of third parties?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,152.861,176.239,"--It certainly applies to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it would be a rather odd rule that the agency which is charged with Congress with administering the statute, has the greatest expertise, is bound by a more demanding standard, but an entity, an outsider with no such statutory mandate and no such expertise is subject to a lower standard when it comes in and asks for a contract rate to be overturned or abrogated."
2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,207.212,219.488,"It's a bit much to say that the importance is to preserve the stability of two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties' contract."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,219.488,222.565,"--Well, the nonparty isn't actually paying the rate."
2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,245.353,256.49,"Well, so why don't you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct, parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you complain about the hordes of people who will be able to challenge these."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,258.861,266.001,"Well, it certainly applies to the parties most directly affected, which are the parties that actually entered into the contract and are paying the rates."
2009.08-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,281.899,297.595,"Is there any other area of the law in which the parties to a contract can, in effect, dictate the substantive standard of administrative review for challenges raised by nonparties?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,297.595,308.702,"--I think the answer is I don't know if there is other areas where there's a possibility of a Memphis clause, if that's what you're referring to, where the parties can actually -- when they enter into a contract, they can actually lower the standard."
2009.08-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.099,332.816,"Am I correct -- and maybe this is more proper for the government than for you, or for all the parties."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,349.795,350.75,No.
2009.08-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.351,366.538,Can I--
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.538,366.866,"--Of course, there is."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,403.615,404.897,"--Scores, yes."
2009.08-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.412,413.878,So that's quite a different picture than the bilateral contracts that were at issue in Sierra and Mobile.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,413.878,419.95,--Certainly FERC agrees with us that at least some of the rates before this Court are contract rates.
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.95,421.233,Did the lower court reach that question?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,421.233,423.28,"No, the lower court didn't address the question."
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.28,424.731,Did we grant cert on that question?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,424.731,438.195,"You did not, and this Court regularly declines to address matters that were merely assumed or presumed by the court below and instead answers the question that was actually answered by the court below, which in this case is an important and recurring question."
2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,449.863,450.721,I'm sorry?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,453.283,465.356,"Simply to say that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine can't apply when the challenge is brought by a noncontracting party, but rather what FERC wrote into the contracts effectively was the highest standard permitted by law will be applied to them."
2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.401,478.692,"You don't agree that FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,478.692,483.067,"No, we don't, which is precisely one of the -- we don't believe that the court had authority to announce that rule."
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,486.736,487.626,It isn't in the case.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,487.626,488.296,--Yes.
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.544,505.412,"This is a case in which, as I think most cases where they approve contracts, what they're finding is that the contract rate in this circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,516.185,516.704,--Yes.
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,522.436,523.029,But then if we were to do that--
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.029,524.308,He took the words right out of your mouth.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,525.182,526.102,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.102,528.82,--But you would -- would you agree with my assumptions there?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,528.82,529.803,Yes.
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.803,553.98,"That what this case is about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of particular economic circumstances, concludes that a particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable system, and once that's in place, then as part of that system is the rule you can only challenge it when it violates the public interest, for example."
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,563.089,563.806,Right.
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,564.04,566.15,"Now, have I just said the correct law in your view or not?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,566.15,569.867,"--We would not -- that, Justice Breyer, in fact would be our back-up position."
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,569.867,570.21,Sorry?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,570.21,571.739,That would be our back-up position.
2009.08-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.956,574.001,But I'm not interested in if you have a back-up or not.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,575.939,578.735,"--Yes, we would agree with it, that that is a correct statement of law."
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.153,595.539,But you just said to Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that this was a contract rate.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,595.539,596.04,--That's right.
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,597.319,600.147,"It assumed it, so you're asking us to assume the same thing and announce--"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,600.147,601.878,--Well--
2009.08-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.878,610.235,"--an advisory opinion that if these are contract rates, they're bound by Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed to do?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,610.235,619.574,"--Well, the answer is that this Court regularly, regularly, addresses the question presented and the issue answered below without delving into underlying assumptions."
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.574,621.714,You could call them all advisory opinions if you want.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,621.714,622.463,That's right.
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.463,624.292,Whenever there is another issue in the case--
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,624.292,625.197,"Right, and one example--"
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.197,629.553,"--for which we remand, you could say, oh, we're just giving an advisory opinion on the issue that--"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,629.553,631.585,--That's precisely right.
2009.08-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.947,668.774,"Could you give me an example of a -- of a challenge to a rate that's set under this whole program that would succeed under the just and reasonable standard and fail under the public interest standard, or vice versa?"
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,668.774,672.724,--Are you asking me can I conceive of such a rate that would fail and succeed under one?
2009.08-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.724,672.927,Yes.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,672.927,684.251,"I think that -- one of the -- one of the interesting things about the just and reasonable standard, the ordinary just and reasonable standard, is you can actually look at the interests of the contracting parties to a degree that you cannot under the public interest standard."
2009.08-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.233,691.808,I'm not sure that answers my question.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,696.432,698.636,"--Well, they are both the just and reasonable standard."
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.276,702.306,--Yes or no?
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,702.306,702.93,--Yes.
2009.08-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.93,703.538,Okay.
2009.08-674,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,703.538,705.819,If I may reserve the remainder of the time for rebuttal.
2009.08-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,705.819,707.27,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,714.893,726.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals erred in holding that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard is inapplicable when contract rates are challenged by a noncontracting third party."
2009.08-674,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.383,747.006,Were the -- are the Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct in calling this a presumption?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,747.006,750.831,This Court in Morgan Stanley described--
2009.08-674,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.831,760.296,In -- in calling the rate that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,760.296,775.105,"--Well, the -- the Court in Morgan Stanley held that Mobile-Sierra rests in part on the idea that when wholesale businesses negotiate a contract for the sale of power, that that can be presumed to be just and reasonable."
2009.08-674,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,775.105,776.712,So you don't quarrel with that word--
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,776.712,778.635,No.
2009.08-674,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.149,780.475,--or would you quarrel with that characterization?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,780.475,783.486,--That's the way that this Court has described the standard.
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.51,807.008,"Just and reasonable, or would comply with the public interest standard?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,807.008,808.537,The--
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.537,815.988,"I mean, what's the use of having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine the thing under the usual standard anyway?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,815.988,824.142,"--Well, the settlement -- no one is suggesting that the settlement agreement itself is a Mobile-Sierra contract."
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,839.729,846.725,Your -- your opening statement about what this Court should do is a change from your statement of what we should do in your briefs.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,860.876,864.623,"Well, we -- we do think that you should reverse the holding of the court of appeals."
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,872.34,872.668,But that's a change.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,890.956,896.969,Should have been granted.
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,968.783,978.87,Is there -- what would happen in a situation in which there's a tariff price instead of a contract price?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1007.252,1010.11,In the contract setting?
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1010.11,1010.625,Yes.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1010.625,1015.764,"Yes, third parties could come in, and if they -- they would have to satisfy the public interest test."
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1023.899,1029.584,Could they come in and show that between the contracting parties the price is unfair?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1041.127,1045.966,I think that sort of argument would be foreclosed by Sierra.
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1045.966,1048.481,"Well, but that's the question before us."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1048.481,1049.573,"Well, you have--"
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.573,1058.321,"The D.C. Circuit said they shouldn't be bound by that determination, and you're arguing that they should be because--"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1058.321,1081.233,"--What -- what the Court said in Sierra is that mere unfairness, one of the -- the fact that one of the contracting parties got a bad bargain is not a reason to set aside the contract, except for the Court did reserve the extraordinary circumstance where it's going to put the supplier out of business, which would adversely affect the public interest if they can no longer deliver power at that rate."
2009.08-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.233,1082.122,May I--
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1082.122,1103.425,"--So it goes back to my original question with your adversary, which is: Is there a difference among the objectors here, between those who are objecting to the terms between the two contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the public, and those who are objecting because this settlement agreement does something different?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1114.983,1117.187,"I think there are two responses to that, Your Honor."
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1121.729,1122.026,I agree.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1122.026,1122.197,--Okay.
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.197,1124.303,And so the question is: Should there be a distinction?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1124.303,1124.759,Yes.
2009.08-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1151.28,1155.746,"And that's what the Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below didn't--"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1155.746,1160.448,The court did not use that mode of analysis.
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.581,1186.575,"You're saying, in effect, that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement between A and B that not only sets the rate between the two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will charge to C?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1195.59,1199.915,"--That's right, because C's rate in that scenario is not a rate that it has agreed to."
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.082,1209.472,Right.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1211.146,1211.458,"--No, that is--"
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.458,1217.267,The D.C. Circuit said that the entire -- there is no application of Mobile-Sierra at all.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1217.267,1217.782,--That's right.
2009.08-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.981,1233.259,"--But it is your view, is it not, that the rates that result from the auction are not contract rates within the meaning of Mobile-Sierra?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1233.259,1240.337,"That -- that is our view, that that's -- it's not the basis for the court of appeals' decision."
2009.08-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1240.337,1255.3,"The court of appeals never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case, whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it is not -- and whether FERC has the authority nonetheless to apply the public interest standard."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1260.248,1261.797,"That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1263.952,1268.401,"And just to follow up, you think we should not address either of those--"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1268.401,1269.291,--No--
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1269.291,1274.727,--whether it's a contract or whether you have authority to make an exception to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1274.727,1282.413,"--No, we think the Court should answer only the question that was ruled upon below and leave those other issues to the extent that they have been properly--"
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.413,1283.146,How can we?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1320.819,1336.343,"--Well, I think we agree with Petitioners that it is quite common for this Court to decide a case, taking the case on the same assumption that the court of appeals did, and answer the questions that are raised--"
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.343,1341.573,"We would have to take it on the assumption -- wait, I don't want -- you have 5 minutes left that you're reserving?"
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1341.573,1343.604,--I'm not--
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1343.604,1345.137,You don't get to reserve time.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1345.137,1345.542,--Right.
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.525,1348.276,What's the assumption?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1373.296,1381.387,"No, Your Honor, because we do agree that at least some of the rates that are covered by the public interest review clause in the settlement--"
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1381.387,1382.339,The transition rates?
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1382.339,1384.9,--The transition rates as between the settling parties.
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.9,1386.522,But the reasonableness depends upon the other.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1392.38,1402.906,"Well, their validity doesn't -- their validity depends upon the mechanism that's created by the settlement, which the Commission reviewed under the ordinary just and reasonable standard."
2009.08-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.826,1410.404,"That's all true, but I would want to know what the Commission thought about that one, too."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1410.404,1420.492,--What -- what the Commission thought is that the -- the Commission looked at the auction mechanism and determined that it was likely to produce just and reasonable results.
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.355,1486.087,"Well, we -- we don't know that that's the other side's position."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1510.638,1512.795,"Well, the--"
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.795,1523.807,"I have assumed that their position is the Commission remains bound by Mobile-Sierra, but these third parties can -- can demand a court -- that a court apply a different standard."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1523.807,1529.882,"--I had not understood that to be their position, but I think it would be very strange--"
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.882,1530.319,We can--
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1530.319,1536.332,"--if the Commission had one Standard, and on review of the Commission order, the court were to apply a standard different from what--"
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.332,1543.297,"--I'm not sure that's any stranger than saying the Commission has one standard until somebody else challenges it, whereupon the Commission has a different standard."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1544.779,1548.343,--I -- I think we would agree that they're both quite strange.
2009.08-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.343,1549.716,Yes.
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1551.497,1553.463,If there are no further questions--
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.463,1554.652,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2009.08-674,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1554.652,1554.871,--Thank you.
2009.08-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.871,1561.679,General Blumenthal.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1561.679,1564.116,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1618.311,1620.42,"Well, they can self-supply, can't they?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1620.42,1630.229,"Even if they had that option, Justice Sotomayor, it would not change a tariff into a contract."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.379,1648.019,They're not bound to it.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1686.845,1691.642,"--Justice Scalia, with all due respect, that situation is not here."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.642,1696.219,But that's what the court of appeals decided.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1726.39,1729.606,"Absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.32,1806.435,"But I thought one large difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement, that that rate would not be subject to just and reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate it."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1822.708,1843.765,Section 4.C of the settlement agreement that FERC approved under the just and reasonable standard says to the world: We can make an exception for ourselves under the just and reasonable -- under the Memphis rule.
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.354,1856.087,I didn't -- I didn't follow.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1860.899,1862.007,--There is.
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.332,1894.617,Why?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1894.617,1898.381,--who never agreed to this supposed contract.
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.381,1899.816,Why are you powerless?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1899.816,1901.489,I'm sorry.
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.489,1906.909,"Why don't you to go to the Commission and say: Commission, there is always special circumstances."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1940.878,1963.272,"Justice Breyer, there is an immense difference, as you and the Court is well aware because it has been articulated in opinions, between the public interest standard and the ordinary just and reasonable standard, and the government would like that discretion to say in effect--"
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.272,1967.052,"My point is if you don't like that as applied to your situation, you have a remedy."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1987.104,1990.102,"--We're not here by choice, Your Honor."
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.507,1991.428,It's electricity.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,1991.428,1997.098,"If you tell me at this point to go home, I'm happy to do it."
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.935,2013.168,"Then you're going to say you mean they never can do it, but it's well settled."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2043.389,2053.556,But the -- the Commission should not be accorded discretion to adopt a standard that contravenes the statute.
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.385,2056.803,"The standard -- the statute is ""just and reasonable""."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2085.12,2105.91,"--What we're dealing with in this case is the question of whether the government and the Commission should have virtually unbridled discretion to adopt a standard that has been called ""practically insurmountable"", as recently as Morgan Stanley."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.097,2109.361,"But that -- that's because of section 4.C, you say?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2109.361,2111.935,--Section 4.C of the agreement--
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.935,2112.137,Right.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2156.569,2157.568,--Our answer is--
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.568,2160.316,Do you support the opinion of the -- of the court below?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2160.316,2166.58,"--We do support it, Justice Scalia, and the reason we do is that Mobile-Sierra is about contracts."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.672,2168.408,It isn't about contracts.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2203.925,2211.825,--It -- it can be held -- upheld only between the two contracting parties if they're the ones who have agreed to it.
2009.08-674,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.64,2227.053,"But the rationale is the commonsense notion that it's a presumptively reasonable rate, and if that's true, how is that altered by the identity of the party that attacks it?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2227.053,2243.233,"Because, Your Honor, the question also is what the standard should be if it's presumptively reasonable; and it is taken as such, because it is freely negotiated, because there is consent to it."
2009.08-674,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2257.556,2264.847,"Well, why is -- why is it not presumptively a commonsense notion when some different party attacks it?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2273.454,2278.749,"--As to this case, again, there are no rates yet."
2009.08-674,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2291.868,2292.102,Yes.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2300.037,2325.883,"--Well, you know, I feel, with all due respect, that we are talking in alternate universes here, the government and the Petitioners and we; and the reason is, as the Court has quite aptly identified, the court of appeals used a rationale that simply is not wholly fitting to the facts here."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.883,2330.789,"Why shouldn't we tell them that, and then they can pick it up from there?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2330.789,2331.382,Well--
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.382,2338.474,Because what they did say could be -- have heavy consequences.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2401.713,2414.363,"--Because addressing that question, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Breyer said, is not the question that the Commission addressed."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.153,2433.636,"Yes, but we don't like to decide these questions, you know, initially."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2451.611,2461.594,--And the government's position on certiorari was that there should be a remand without reversal for reconsideration in light of Morgan Stanley.
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2461.594,2466.137,You're in a very tough position because of the way this has progressed.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2487.285,2500.605,"And I recognize that fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court is presented with a dilemma here because it's dealing with tariff rates when the question presented talks about contract rates."
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.605,2514.023,"So is the answer then maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were going, that -- because where I'm coming from, why I have been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the question so far on the question presented is ""sometimes""."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2549.1,2556.38,"And, Justice Breyer, the ""sometimes"" is absolutely right from our standpoint."
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2556.38,2558.735,"Well, but if we ruled that--"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2558.735,2559.078,There may be--
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2559.078,2567.918,"--If we decided it on that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra, even though that wasn't presented in this case."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2567.918,2568.917,--No.
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2578.038,2578.662,"Oh, I know--"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2578.662,2579.427,--by tariff rates.
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2579.427,2583.081,"--but Justice Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and sometimes they can't be."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2590.998,2604.6,"The Mr. Chief Justice, is that the ""sometimes"" would include contract rates."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.982,2625.84,Has anybody before--
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2625.84,2626.499,--Mobile-Sierra fits.
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.499,2630.777,"--even suggested that Mobile-Sierra is a ""sometimes"" thing?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2662.496,2663.448,Mobile--
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.448,2674.256,"Have we ever suggested how you can -- you can have a ""sometimes"" doctrine which will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile-Sierra was intended to produce?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2699.541,2722.657,"--Again, I may have been unclear, and I apologize if I was, in response to Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice's question, but the point is that the ""sometimes"" would not apply to the situation that we have here, where there are rates of general applicability and tariffs."
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2722.657,2728.218,"Can I -- can I go -- stop you there, just so that we're all on the same page?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2772.232,2784.648,"Justice Sotomayor, we are not challenging that a contract should bind those two parties or those hundred-plus parties that agree to the contract."
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2784.648,2787.288,"Well, that -- you can't because that's the doctrine."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2805.873,2813.824,"Well, the public interest standard, as articulated in Morgan Stanley, would require showing an extraordinarily high burden of proof."
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2813.824,2815.821,You haven't answered my question.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2822.087,2823.164,If--
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2823.164,2844.638,"There's a rate set between two parties, what third parties -- under what circumstances could a third party come in and say -- on some standard different than contrary to the public interest, how could they prove other that that rate's not fair and reasonable?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2844.638,2848.67,--If that party were directly affected--
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2848.67,2851.965,"What does the word ""directly affected"" mean to you?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2851.965,2856.57,--It would mean having to pay rates that flow inevitably--
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2856.57,2856.913,No.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2902.241,2916.72,"--Our position, Justice Sotomayor -- and it's a hypothetical here because, again -- and I apologize for belaboring the point, but what we have here are rates of general applicability."
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.72,2920.187,"You want to keep going back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a hypothetical."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2920.187,2934.026,"And the hypothetical, I would say, is answerable that the just and reasonable standard, as it was applied in Bridgeport Energy and Milford Power and tens of other cases--"
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2934.026,2937.399,So you are taking the extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower court said?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2947.222,2953.236,--Fair and reasonable is a standard different from the public interest standard.
2009.08-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2955.235,2968.478,So your adversary's arguments that what you're really saying is you can never have finality to a contract agreement between parties because any third party can come in and raise--
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.429,2977.584,"But FERC can't -- can FERC -- can FERC challenge, too?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2979.366,2987.208,"Well, FERC is -- is bound by the same law that applies to third parties, which is--"
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.208,2987.645,Okay.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2991.314,2993.221,--Mobile-Sierra applies--
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.221,2993.938,Who does it apply to?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2996.156,3009.883,"--Mobile-Sierra effectively says those two parties are bound by the contract, and FERC is bound by it -- that's Morgan Stanley -- no matter when the issue is raised."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.883,3010.195,Okay.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3010.195,3018.49,"And a noncontracting party, if it is a rate that applies generally, can challenge it."
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.49,3027.346,"Can a noncontracting party go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3037.343,3044.963,FERC is bound by the just and reasonable standard.
2009.08-674,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.268,3066.017,"No, no."
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3096.445,3122.15,"It -- it is part -- they are one standard, as Morgan Stanley very clearly says, and the question of what noncontracting parties can challenge a statute depends on who the noncontracting party is, the nature of the contract, what interest is affected, and I would presume some of those factors might affect FERC's judgment."
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.15,3136.052,"So are you aware of any law or any statement by any judge, ever, that exempts the -- the FERC from the basic requirement that its rules, regulations, and everything else not be arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3136.052,3139.207,The answer to that question is no.
2009.08-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.207,3139.472,No.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3178.986,3196.761,"Where we are is, if Your Honor please, if the Court were to modify or clarify the public interest standard to make it more accommodating to the kinds of challenges we've been discussing, that could be one outcome here."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3196.761,3200.586,That's a third standard between just and reasonable and public interest?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3202.71,3210.517,"Well, simply to clarify that it involves not necessarily an insurmountable barrier."
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.517,3213.704,"It's also a third question that's not presented, right?"
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3213.704,3231.353,"It is again a question not presented, and none of us so far on this side of the table has mentioned the Chenery doctrine, but perhaps that also should be considered, that the agency made a decision on a different basis than it is now advocating before the Court."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3231.353,3235.587,But you are defending the D.C. Circuit's decision?
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3276.472,3284.064,"And -- yes, Justice Ginsburg, we're defending the D.C. Circuit's ruling and decision."
2009.08-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3316.722,3317.548,It didn't say that.
2009.08-674,2,38829,richard_blumenthal,,3317.548,3339.917,"And one modifier would have spared this Court and ourselves the difficulties that we now have, but it is that modifier that would, in effect, surmount the very difficult and thorny issues that the Court has well identified here."
2009.08-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.366,3346.023,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-674,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3348.617,3351.178,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-674,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3351.178,3360.72,Does anything in your argument turn on the fact that the Respondents were parties to the settlement process?
2009.08-674,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3360.72,3361.968,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-674,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3431.926,0.0,I like that.
2009.08-674,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3434.172,3434.671,--I hope you use it.
2009.08-674,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3435.752,3439.499,"Thank you, counsel."
