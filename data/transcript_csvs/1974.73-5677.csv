1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,137.832,Mr. Moyer I think you may now proceed whenever you're ready.
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,137.832,141.17,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.679,227.637,"There was a conflict in the testimony on his capacity, was there not?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,227.637,229.595,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.967,237.721,And with their four defendants' psychiatrists --
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,237.721,241.685,"At the time of trial, there were two civilian Japanese psychiatrists."
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,418.032,422.999,"I suppose he is still eligible for further executive clemency, is he not Mr. Moyer?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,422.999,429.519,Presumably he could petition regularly for additional executive clemency.
1974.73-5677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.994,443.791,"This presumably better off in that class of people, who didn't get or sentenced to death didn't get executive clemency and were executed?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,443.791,445.566,He certainly was not executed.
1974.73-5677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.44,459.754,Do you know that the death penalty --
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,459.754,460.738,I'm sorry sir.
1974.73-5677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.738,465.54,You know that the death penalty is cruel and unusual in the military situations?
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,465.54,469.548,"Well, the Government has raised that point here."
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,479.373,488.951,"Now that I've interrupted you, as I looked at your brief and your reply brief, I think you didn't cite Warden against Marrero of last term."
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,497.115,527.097,"Warden against Marrero involved primarily, Mr. Justice Blackmun, a statutory question about parole applicability for the petitioner there and the effect of a 1970 statute dealing exclusively with drug traffickers and whether someone who was ineligible for parole under prior statute was -- should be considered eligible for parole subsequent to the 1970 statute."
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,960.946,965.623,Was any objection made at the time of the commutation?
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,965.623,969.615,"No, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,997.828,1023.197,"On your theory Mr. Moyer, if a military -- if a man in military were sentenced to, let us say, 30 years and that was commuted down to 20 or 10 on condition of no-parole, that would be equally unconstitutional, I take it."
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1023.197,1031.494,"Well, the first point to notice that a 30-year sentence would never come before the President in the course of ordinary military appellate review if one's --"
1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.494,1032.81,Only death sentences?
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1032.81,1033.826,That's correct.
1974.73-5677,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.184,1083.586,"Suppose Mr. Moyer the statute imposed a flat 30-year penalty, could the President commute that to 10 years?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1083.586,1085.298,"We certainly would say that he could, Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-5677,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.298,1088.3,"Why, the statute doesn't authorize him so to do?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1088.3,1102.847,"Well, the question, the rule in the Wells case and Biddle against Perovich which require -- the rule requires that there'd be some legislative basis is as stated in those cases a broad rule."
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1121.089,1122.735,I'm assuming there is no an alternative?
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1122.735,1124.972,There is none in this case.
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1321.681,1328.178,"Of course, the statute in Marrero isn't quite in line on what you've just said."
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1334.856,1339.824,"Well, the statute that issue there, Mr. Blackmun, I think the --"
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1339.824,1341.059,But it was a statute.
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1341.059,1342.012,That's correct Mr. Justice --
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1342.012,1344.665,The events in congressional policy at least.
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1344.665,1345.185,That's right.
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1389.039,1396.292,"Well, then are you suggesting that if possibly it could be done today constitutionally?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1396.292,1407.669,The question of whether the President -- of what punishments the President could commute to today would depend upon what punishments today are authorized by the legislature.
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1417.501,1422.926,But at least today we have the example of the Marrero statute.
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1422.926,1429.324,We do today have a statute which imposes life imprisonment without possibility of parole.
1974.73-5677,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1452.756,1457.144,"Is that because it is more offensive crime than murder, do you think?"
1974.73-5677,0,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,1457.144,1482.283,"No, the congressional reports there stated that the purposes of rehabilitation in the context of drug traffickers could be carried out only by keeping such offenders within prisons, that the parole policy was uniquely inapplicable to that situation."
1974.73-5677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1551.901,1553.144,Mr. Claiborne?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1553.144,1555.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.558,1729.658,You don't have the facts this has been done?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1729.658,1745.079,"Mr. Justice Marshall, so far as our research indicates, President Eisenhower on five occasions, include -- five occasions in addition to this one, commuted death sentences with the condition of no parole."
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.411,1799.649,How many is it in Federal Government?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1799.649,1810.266,"Well, we do have of course, as Mr. Justice Blackmun, pointed out the narcotic statute which does expressly as a matter of congressional decision did not grow."
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1810.266,1816.552,"In narcotics, convictions received any clemency?"
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1816.552,1816.755,Not --
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.755,1817.579,This is no?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1817.579,1818.922,Not that I'm --
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.922,1819.782,Right.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1819.782,1820.382,Undoubtedly --
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1820.382,1829.659,"So, that had nothing to do with my point is how many times that we had clemency without a parole by the President of the United States?"
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1829.659,1838.854,"Well, so far as I'm aware, Mr. Justice Marshall, six instances by President Eisenhower and two by President Wilson."
1974.73-5677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.824,1862.041,Do you have any idea how many sense is in total President Eisenhower commuted?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1862.041,1863.457,Of military death sentence --
1974.73-5677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.457,1863.897,Yes.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1863.897,1865.135,Of sentences of --
1974.73-5677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.135,1866.792,"No, military sentences."
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1866.792,1891.845,Military death sentences during President Eisenhower's period in office would at a guess and it's really a guess because the figures are divided in ways that don't show it too clearly of something in the order of 20.
1974.73-5677,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2367.138,2369.288,This is Court of Appeals.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2369.288,2372.248,Court of Appeals.
1974.73-5677,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2372.248,2374.373,Other place where as Court of Appeals --
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2374.373,2380.733,"I have been too far away, it was just meant."
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.227,2616.478,If one can accept the thesis of how it came about that the one corporal or sergeant in World War II was executed for desertion?
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2618.109,2620.032,"Slovik, I believe."
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.863,2624.794,"Slovik, Slovik."
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2635.256,2636.286,"Well, I'm not sure --"
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2636.286,2642.236,That's at least the thesis of what happened in that case is to Corporal Slovik or Sergeant Slovik.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2642.236,2648.829,"Mr. Justice Stewart, in the particular case of Sergeant Slovik, I cannot --"
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.829,2650.972,I don't know the facts but really --
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2650.972,2655.085,"Of course, there were many death sentences imposed and executed in World War II."
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.085,2656.123,But only one for --
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2656.123,2657.39,Only one for desertion.
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2657.39,2659.193,Desertion.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2659.193,2666.976,"Those that were imposed for murder one doesn't know whether it was the murder of the commanding officer or an officer one for desertion, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.73-5677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.976,2669.409,You have to carry out with more than one imposed.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2669.409,2671.117,"And they were, they were something --"
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2671.117,2674.239,"Many, many, many imposed and only one carried out."
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2674.239,2675.556,Yes.
1974.73-5677,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.241,2693.747,Murder.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2693.747,2699.39,"Murder one doesn't know whether that was military or not, it could have been."
1974.73-5677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2818.015,2826.587,"In other words, in that view the President is a continuing de facto parole."
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2826.587,2832.727,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice and it is open to the prisoner."
1974.73-5677,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2852.705,2855.439,But Mr. Moyer say that there had been an effort --
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2855.439,2857.729,"Well, I frankly was unaware."
1974.73-5677,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2860.131,2860.825,Yes.
1974.73-5677,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2860.825,2869.591,It is -- I'm not for a moment suggesting that I have any basis on which to encourage the hope that such an application would be successful.
1974.73-5677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.248,2878.238,"Thank you, Mr. Claiborne."
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,2883.653,2888.621,Mr. Chief Justice I have only two brief points in rebuttal.
1974.73-5677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.575,2926.711,"Well, but your proposition is based on the assumption that we've decided this issue in broad enough scope to embrace military?"
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,2926.711,2927.957,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-5677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.957,2929.219,And that's your starting point.
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,2929.219,2933.088,That's right and that's the second point that I would like to address.
1974.73-5677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.906,3063.593,"Well, I suppose it would be arguable that that demonstrates equally or perhaps no more than that the discipline in the marine corps is much better and that the quality and caliber of the people is higher as they traditionally claim."
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3063.593,3077.652,"I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice in the same way, it could be argued that the more random and the more freakish the imposition of the death penalty is, the more that shows that the deterrent effect is created by the death penalty."
1974.73-5677,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3077.652,3077.818,How --
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3077.818,3078.381,We --
1974.73-5677,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.381,3081.398,How many death penalties you say when?
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3081.398,3086.489,102 were executed during World War II.
1974.73-5677,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.73,3092.867,You mean carried out.
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3092.867,3094.442,That's correct.
1974.73-5677,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.591,3100.207,Because I know of one is with 51 were sentenced to death but they didn't die.
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3100.207,3100.831,That's correct.
1974.73-5677,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.972,3103.011,"So, there were more that were imposed."
1974.73-5677,2,27717,homer_e_moyer_jr,,3103.011,3104.2,"Oh, yes indeed."
1974.73-5677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3108.442,3109.117,Thank you gentlemen.
