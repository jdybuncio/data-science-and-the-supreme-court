1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.107,We will hear arguments next in First National Maintenance Corporation v. the Labor Board.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,56.696,58.118,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.735,114.798,Mandatory nature of what?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,114.798,117.312,"--Effects bargaining, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,150.315,154.109,"Mr. Pollack, was this a fairly large operation in New York?"
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,154.109,155.39,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,183.409,190.673,Does the record show whether there is much turnover in this business as far as servicing customers is concerned?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,190.673,192.781,"No, Your Honor, the record does not show that."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.325,517.278,What happened to the employees when the employer withdrew?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,517.278,523.476,"Your Honor, as part of the effects bargaining, there were negotiations and the employees were ultimately granted severance pay."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.943,535.753,But they were not in fact hired in one of the other three facilities?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,535.753,549.389,"Your Honor, it is not part of this record because the effects bargaining was stipulated to at the lower level and it was acceded by all parties that there should and is mandatory bargaining on the effects, clearly."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,634.698,636.697,Was there a successor employer here?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,636.697,638.166,"--Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,638.166,639.196,Someone to do that job?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,639.196,640.086,"Yes, sir, there--"
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.086,643.819,Was there any claim of the employees that they were entitled to?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,643.819,648.598,"--They did in fact, as the record shows, make a claim on the successor."
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,656.112,658.97,Was there any privity between the new employer and the old?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,658.97,681.116,"Well, in that, that they had a contract which put the old employer into the business as the nursing home subcontractor; there was that kind of privity, but there is no allegation that there is an alter ego concept as between First National and Greenpark or an unlawful successorship."
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,681.116,682.069,Let me get at it more directly.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,682.069,682.788,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.788,686.129,Did First National have anything to do with the nursing home after they terminated?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,686.129,688.472,"Nothing, Your Honor; nothing."
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.472,689.409,Then there was no privity.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,689.409,691.002,That was the end of their relationship.
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.002,692.001,Then there is no privity?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,692.001,694.751,At this point there is no privity; that is certainly correct.
1980.80-544,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.198,909.368,"Well, you're effectively arguing for the position that Judge Kearse took in her dissent in the 2nd Circuit."
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,909.368,914.74,"That's extremely true, Your Honor, very much so, and I think that's in line with Fibreboard and Darlington."
1980.80-544,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,914.74,923.673,That you have to... may have to bargain over the consequences of the closing but that you don't have to bargain over whether or not you'd close?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,923.673,924.736,"Indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-544,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,928.407,931.983,Did you state a little while back that you have bargained over the consequences?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,931.983,933.108,"Yes, Your Honor, that has been done."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,936.763,938.98,"No, but what was the result of that bargaining?"
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,938.98,941.526,--There was severance pay paid to the employees.
1980.80-544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.77,962.081,"Well, now, wouldn't the new employer have to be a party to that bargaining?"
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,962.081,968.828,"No, Your Honor, because the discussion concerned itself with preferential hiring in other facilities operated by the petitioner herein."
1980.80-544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,969.609,970.0,Oh.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,973.576,975.607,--Not necessarily.
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,984.198,986.478,"Well, no, wouldn't it go beyond that?"
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,993.303,995.505,"--I think that other... oh, indeed, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.72,1005.252,That's our Burns Detective and other cases.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,1005.252,1006.375,"--Oh, indeed, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1010.39,1024.275,There's been much in the newspapers about Ford and Chrysler and others completely shutting down plants and letting go some several thousands of employees.
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,1035.488,1043.189,"--Your Honor, there are... if I may, we must be careful not to read into this problem a problem of normal layoffs."
1980.80-544,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1044.438,1053.965,"No, no, I'm talking about... what I've been reading is, in Mahwah, New Jersey, for example, Ford has completely cut out a plant, stopped operating it entirely."
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,1059.244,1059.494,--Yes.
1980.80-544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.115,1082.174,"Are you saying that if Ford simultaneously opened a new plant in Hamburg, Germany, employing substantially the same number of people, that that would be a subject of mandatory bargaining?"
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,1082.174,1082.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.667,1102.431,And you think that situation as hypothesized by the Chief Justice is similar enough to Fibreboard to have the Fibreboard rule apply?
1980.80-544,0,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,1102.431,1106.147,"Well, there is, of course, Your Honor, a very vast geographic difference."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1385.098,1388.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1533.633,1540.739,"Since you emphasize the two days, what if they had given them 30 days notice, as soon as they terminated with the nursing home?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1542.692,1573.381,"Well, had they given them 30 days, it is conceivable, given the type of monetary problem that petitioner had, that the union would have been able to bargain over ways of reducing the labor costs that would have enabled petitioner to remain with the contract."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.861,1702.033,Mr. Come?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1702.033,1702.83,Yes?
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.83,1713.184,"Wouldn't that statement you just made require this Court to at least disapprove the 8th Circuit's decision in the Burns case, as to the Omaha operation?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1713.184,1728.193,I think that it depends upon the reasons for the decision.
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.662,1781.016,"When you're talking about bargaining, you're talking about bargaining between the employer and the union, are you not?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1781.016,1781.875,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.875,1798.774,"So when you say that there is little or nothing that the union could contribute to the bargaining process, you're talking about a discussion between the employer and somebody else besides the union?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1798.774,1813.862,"No, I'm talking about the type of considerations that go into a decision to terminate an operation, as we have here."
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1871.181,1890.847,"Tell me, Mr. Come, has the Board taken the position... for example, it's a single plant, and it's organized, and the employer just has such a hassle constantly with the union that he says, it's not worth it, I'm going to give up and go move to Florida, and I'm going to get out of business."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1910.228,1934.782,I don't know that the Board has had that case but I would point out that there are cases that suggest that the Board would find that there might not be an obligation in that situation.
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.782,1941.67,And it wouldn't be an unfair practice under (a)(3) or something?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1941.67,1942.982,"No, because under--"
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.982,1944.779,Or (a) something.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1944.779,1946.418,--8(a)(3).
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1948.089,1949.589,Let me give you a slight variation of that.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1968.83,1999.084,"--Well, as I've pointed out to Justice Brennan, I don't recall such a case, but I am confident, at least in my reading of the analogous situations, that the Board would be unlikely to find a bargaining obligation in that sort of a situation."
1980.80-544,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.094,2017.718,"Mr. Come, why is it poles apart?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2030.01,2056.405,"Well, I think that Judge Adams in the Brockway case summed it up better than I can when he pointed out that a decision to close down can be motivated by a variety of considerations."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.441,2096.748,"Well, Mr. Come, what if a 40-year-old couple who are proprietors decide that they're sick and tired of shoveling snow up here in the north and want to move to Florida?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2101.793,2102.606,--I don't think so.
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.412,2160.113,"Well, the union could point it out to him by sending him a letter, couldn't it?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2160.113,2178.169,"Well, sending a letter does not have the same meaning or likelihood for persuasion that sitting down at the bargaining table--"
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.169,2184.509,"Well, but you're suggesting that the union is kind of a management consultant that can help him save money."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2184.509,2198.41,"--No, it is not a management consultant but it certainly knows about what wages--"
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.41,2200.581,"Do you mean something like this, Mr. Come?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2217.683,2229.242,"--That is what I'm talking about, and that is exactly what has happened in many forms and is happening today--"
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2229.242,2233.255,But what about the situation--
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2233.255,2235.941,--in the rubber industry and in the auto industry.
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2235.941,2246.547,"--Well, I was going to ask, what about the... maybe I'm wrong about the facts, but didn't Ford cut, close down, permanently close down its Mahwah plant and let some 4,000 employees go?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2246.547,2247.156,It did.
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2247.156,2250.029,"Now, was there any negotiation with Ford about the closure of that plant?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2250.029,2310.989,"I don't know about that plant, but there are instances which we have set out in our brief where in the rubber industry and in other auto plants, UAW and Chrysler, for example, before the loan guarantee statute was enacted, did bargain about the decision in advance, and as a result of that bargaining the union did agree to take wage cuts, defer pension accruals, defer cost of living increases, with the result that the plant was able to continue operating."
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.989,2323.843,"Mr. Come, perhaps you can't answer this in just a word but are you defending the court of appeals opinion here or are you furthering Board's view, or both?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2329.185,2334.527,"Well, I think that the court did."
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.886,2345.474,"Well, it sustained on the judgment, maybe, but the Board's rule is more of a per se rule than the court of appeals would agree to, isn't it?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2345.474,2348.068,"--No, I don't think so."
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.578,2363.968,"This is your so-called Ozark rule, is that it?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2363.968,2377.415,"--Well, it's the Ozark rule as modified in the light of cases subsequent to--"
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.415,2379.883,In the light of subsequent elections.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2390.426,2393.393,--I think it would; I think it would.
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.393,2394.814,That's all I really--
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2394.814,2443.216,"I think there's really no difference other than perhaps a difference in formulation between the court of appeals position and that of the Court, which is that as a general principle, there is a duty to bargain about an economic decision to shut down a part of an operation, absent a showing that such bargaining would be futile or significantly interfere with the employer's right to manage his business."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.635,2454.744,"--Well, does the Board recognize any exception to its Ozark rule?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2454.744,2457.868,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.817,2507.3,"We'll resume there at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2525.293,2550.424,--The heart of this case was illustrated by a question of Justice Brennan's before the example that he gave of the closing of the auto plants.
1980.80-544,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2676.249,2688.68,"Mr. Come, does it make any difference that in this case the nursing home had agreed to pay all of the labor cost and was obligated to do so?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2688.68,2691.367,"No, Your--"
1980.80-544,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2691.367,2696.724,"That was not the case, of course, in the examples you've cited."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2696.724,2697.662,--That is correct.
1980.80-544,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2710.406,2713.311,Is that demonstrated by the record in this case?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2713.311,2719.872,I believe that it is.
1980.80-544,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2719.872,2727.884,Would not the nursing home also have to participate in the bargaining?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2742.471,2748.781,"Well, there was certainly no indication that that would be the problem."
1980.80-544,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2750.594,2753.28,Is there any evidence as to what the nursing home would be willing to do?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2753.28,2784.672,"--No, the only indication is that, when the union was told to go to the nursing home about keeping on the employees, the nursing home said that, we can't do it because there's a clause in the contract the precludes us from hiring any of the petitioner's employees for 90 days."
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2784.672,2804.135,"Anyway, Mr. Come, even if the nursing home took the position that $250 is our rock bottom dollar, we're not going to contribute any more, you wouldn't have to have them in the negotiation if you could get the union to agree to reduce their wages enough to make up the additional $250, would it?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2804.135,2804.915,That is correct.
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2901.752,2906.125,"Well, Mr. Come, what precisely was the factual sequence here?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2913.045,2913.545,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.509,2932.396,"Did the contract contain any provision calling for consultation or notice, independent of any other factors here?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2932.396,2947.593,"--No, it did not, because at the time the contract was negotiated the union had not been certified as the bargaining representative and the petitioner and the union never got to negotiating a contract."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2975.255,2981.956,But does a duty to bargain under the Act supply a contractual term that is nonexistent?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2981.956,2994.448,"--Well, the duty to bargain imposes a legal obligation that might... there was no contract between the union and the employer."
1980.80-544,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.135,3005.821,But you're making the duty to bargain in effect a part of a contractual provision that was nonexistent.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3005.821,3009.116,"--No, I think you misunderstand me, Your Honor."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3100.766,3104.639,Where is the obligation to stay in business?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3113.541,3123.507,I don't think that there is an obligation to stay in business if you want to go completely out of business.
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3127.692,3130.238,Isn't that what was done here?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3130.238,3138.657,"--No, Your Honor, it was not done here because this employer remained in business."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3139.892,3140.782,Not in this business.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3147.545,3152.809,"--Well, he remains in business at his other nursing homes."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.85,3171.988,"Well, but Chrysler is not only willing but anxious to remain in business, but they certainly can close some of their plants which are nonproductive in order to survive."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3171.988,3174.066,"After bargaining, however."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.141,3183.78,Do you suggest that Chrysler had to bargain with somebody before they closed a plant somewhere?
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3183.78,3186.029,--I am suggesting that.
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.825,3211.847,"Well, the fact that they did doesn't necessarily, they may have done that in terms of future relations with the United Automobile Workers because they've got to continue to work together, but are you saying there's an obligation if they decide that a losing plant must be closed, an obligation to negotiate?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3211.847,3222.842,"Where the considerations are of the nature that we have here, if it is--"
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3222.842,3232.183,"What you mean, Mr. Come, if the union can contribute anything which would lead the employer not to close the plant, then he ought to sit down with the union and negotiate."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3235.134,3235.541,--That is correct.
1980.80-544,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.541,3236.541,"Or you lose your case, don't you?"
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3236.541,3237.791,That is correct.
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.911,3301.562,"Mr. Come, I was a little surprised to hear you say that you would accept the court of appeals' view that a presumption was enough to satisfy the Board."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3323.741,3332.378,"--I don't know that that would be a... the court of appeals didn't say, just a presumption."
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.643,3335.44,It said that the employer... that there was--
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3335.44,3336.252,--that the employer would have to show--
1980.80-544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.252,3336.799,--a presumption that he must bargain.
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3342.295,3349.527,"--Well, but the reason that the court of appeals gave was that bargaining would not effectuate the purposes of the statute."
1980.80-544,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3360.525,3364.663,"I thought you told me earlier, Mr. Come, in precisely... I gave you that hypothetical."
1980.80-544,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3370.427,3383.233,"--Well, I'm talking about a situation where he goes completely out of business, which is the Darlington situation, for an anti-union reason."
1980.80-544,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.562,3425.936,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Pollack?"
1980.80-544,2,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,3425.936,3426.139,Yes.
1980.80-544,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3518.071,3519.383,I don't understand that argument.
1980.80-544,2,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,3538.032,3550.917,"Because the contract between Greenpark, which was the nursing home, and First National, says that the nursing home repays the out-of-pocket expenses of First National plus a management fee."
1980.80-544,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.982,3622.856,"Well, it's a court of appeals opinion--"
1980.80-544,2,41868,sanford_e_pollack,,3622.856,3625.574,Or the court of appeals opinion in that very case.
