1995.94-1785,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.508,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1785, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Robert F. Lundy."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,9.728,12.799,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.005,127.674,"Mr. Jones, in subsection (B) that you're referring to it says that no credit or refund will be allowed unless it was paid within the period which would be applicable under 6511(b)(2)(C), or if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had been filed, whether or not filed."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,137.662,148.31,"--That's... what it means is that, whether or not a claim for refund had actually been filed, the court is to apply these statutes as if a claim for refund was filed on that date."
1995.94-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.272,155.453,And is that what should be done in this case?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,155.453,156.174,Yes.
1995.94-1785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,176.908,183.432,"Why does it say, whether or not, since subsection (C) covers the case in which it had been filed before that?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,183.432,189.764,"Yes, it... subsection (C) applies if a claim had been filed before that date."
1995.94-1785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,195.898,200.312,"Why didn't it just say that it wasn't, or if it wasn't?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,200.312,213.242,"I think one of the reasons it might put it that way is because if you read the rest of subsection (B) it goes on to say, a claim based upon whatever grounds the tax court determined an overpayment was made."
1995.94-1785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,220.318,220.899,"Oh, I see."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,220.899,228.994,The district court only has jurisdiction to consider a judicial claim that is based upon precisely the administrative claim.
1995.94-1785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,244.684,248.117,"Well, in that respect the taxpayer is better off to be in the tax court."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,248.117,250.561,It... the taxpayer has a broader refund argument in the tax courts.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,260.866,265.628,"Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question about (B), the same... the one that is at issue here?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,288.534,290.765,"--He could have filed a return, but--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.765,291.536,What else?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,292.187,293.266,--Yes.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.266,297.269,--other form that the IRS uses that would have enabled him to claim a refund without filing a return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,297.269,305.694,"I think the right answer to your question is that courts have routinely held that refund claims can be submitted informally, that they don't have to be on a return--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.694,311.209,But is there any Internal Revenue form that provides for seeking a refund without filing a return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,311.209,319.235,"--There are... there isn't an Internal Revenue form that, of course, is exactly what you've described, a return that includes a claim for refund."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.206,324.397,But is there an Internal Revenue form that seeks a refund without filing a return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,327.379,328.661,--It would be the amended return form.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.661,332.023,"The amended return form, which is a kind of return."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,332.023,332.902,It is an amended return.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.902,338.856,"But there's no way, is there, to file a claim for refund at that date without also filing a return?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,338.856,341.307,"No, sir, I'm sorry, I must disagree."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.351,346.182,But there's no form.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,354.299,361.095,"There's no IRS form, but there is... but you don't have to use an IRS form to make a refund claim, according to the courts."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.095,363.866,How is the average taxpayer to know that?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,369.8,372.462,"If they went to the IRS, the IRS would probably ask him to file a return--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.462,373.33,Correct.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,373.33,374.472,--which this taxpayer hasn't done.
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.472,377.714,"And that raises a question, Mr. Jones."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,419.482,425.536,"A substituted return is... it's lingo, if you'll pardon the expression."
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.048,446.831,So that substituted return would not have counted--
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,446.831,447.418,No.
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.969,448.91,--to serve as the return.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,448.91,450.651,--It cannot be the taxpayer's return.
1995.94-1785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.651,454.032,Does the taxpayer get a copy of the substituted return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,454.032,456.845,It isn't sent to the taxpayer.
1995.94-1785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.664,473.126,But they don't attach the substituted return to the notice of deficiency.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,475.32,477.47,I can't say definitively.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.151,527.645,"But does the code define the term, claim, as used in this section?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,527.645,531.506,--A claim for refund has been defined judicially.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.506,533.587,I... that wasn't my question.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,533.587,537.42,I'm not familiar with a definition of a claim for refund in the--
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.42,539.46,"Well then, why should we look at the definition of return?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,543.684,544.515,"--Well, Justice--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.515,547.827,--and you've just told me the only way you can file a claim is by filing a return--
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,547.827,548.476,"--No, sir, I didn't."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.476,550.079,"--but yet the claim doesn't include the term, return."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,550.079,550.7,I did not say that.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.893,561.085,You can file a claim informally without first having filed a return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,561.085,561.706,--Absolutely.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.677,564.959,What case gives us an example of that?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,564.959,573.763,"--In our brief, in our reply brief we cite the Salzman Treatise, which elaborates a lot of cases that deal with this subject."
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.805,580.049,Do I understand correctly that it wouldn't have made any difference as long as he didn't file a return?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,580.049,580.89,--Yes.
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.89,583.051,"As you read the statute, he must have filed a return first."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,596.96,598.562,That's absolutely correct.
1995.94-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.431,629.103,"Mr. Jones, other than this, rather unusual circumstances of this case, is there any other time that the 2-year look back period would apply under this subsection?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,629.103,633.146,"Well, it applies whenever--"
1995.94-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.146,638.401,"Does it apply only to circumstances of this case, and in no other instance?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,638.401,644.716,--It applies routinely when the taxpayer has not filed a return before the notice of deficiency is issued.
1995.94-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.989,662.776,"Now, has the IRS been totally consistent in its position and interpretation of this statute?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,673.114,679.058,"There's a long answer to that question which I'd like to give, and I'd like to try to give it in a logical order."
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.618,800.123,"Mr. Jones, may I derail you just for a moment to go back to where you were in the tax court?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,833.835,846.885,"I believe that you've accurately described the facts, Justice Ginsburg, but I also believe that the Commissioner raising the defense in this case is something that he has... she, in this case, has consistently done since the issue has been presented."
1995.94-1785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,850.368,851.299,It's not just a delay.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,862.164,874.914,"--It is... I think it's fair to say that it's relatively common for defenses to be amended, for answers to be amended, and I would hope the Court wouldn't draw any inference from that in this case."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.897,916.339,"Mr. Jones, can I just follow up, because I didn't think I got a complete answer to my question."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,929.35,931.791,--And I--
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.791,934.122,And which of those do you think fits that category?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,934.122,939.827,"--I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I cannot tell you, as I stand here, which of those cases might involve those facts, but I would like--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.827,940.986,Do you think any of them involve that?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,940.986,947.932,"--I would think they might well, and I would be speculating, but let me point out, because you seem... this is something important to you, and I want to emphasize it."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.499,958.478,How do you know that?
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,958.478,970.665,I know that because section 6511 (a) provides a limited look back for situations where the claim for refund is filed at a time that no return had been filed.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.665,971.266,Correct.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,971.266,981.324,"So Congress anticipated that claims for refund could, in fact, be filed where no return had been filed, and provided for a 2-year look back period and, in fact, that's this case."
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.324,983.566,That would be that no return had previously been filed.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,983.566,984.307,Absolutely.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.307,991.479,But that doesn't mean that there could be cases in which the claim for refund could ever be filed without simultaneously filing a return.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,991.479,995.454,If the claim for refund and the return were filed simultaneously--
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.454,996.215,Which they normally would be.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,996.215,997.554,--Which they often are.
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.554,998.345,Normally.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,998.345,1002.727,"Most... ordinarily may be, but certainly or not necessarily required--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.727,1007.432,Except that you can't give me an example in adjudicated cases of one having been filed without the other.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1019.69,1026.675,"--Justice Stevens, if we were to assume that a claim for refund and a return was the same thing, then very little--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.675,1028.166,"Oh, I don't suggest that at all."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1034.71,1035.621,"--Well, Justice--"
1995.94-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.621,1037.251,And you haven't given me a contrary example.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1037.251,1038.893,"--Well, this is such a case."
1995.94-1785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.912,1099.451,"Mr. Jones, can I ask something about the Government's theory of why, when the return is later filed, after the deficiency has been assessed, you do not thereupon get the benefit of the 3-year period?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1103.325,1109.82,"Well, the reason that we see is that section 6512(b)(3) provides a detailed set of answers to these questions."
1995.94-1785,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.982,1117.684,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Jones?"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1117.684,1126.19,--6512(b)(3)(C) says that you can award a refund based upon a prior refund claim filed before a notice of deficiency.
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.969,1192.383,"You just before were saying... you were asked the question, has the Government always been consistent."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1192.383,1193.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.224,1206.442,"And then you said, it's been consistent in the tax court, and then you said, well, in the court of claims for the refunds, it seems to be a little different, and I was wondering if you'd said everything you wanted to say there, or if you wanted to say a little more--"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1206.442,1210.676,"I'd like to try to briefly describe that, because time is limited."
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.588,1274.839,"--It's still a little odd, though, isn't it, in the--"
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1274.839,1276.96,"At most, it's odd--"
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.96,1279.962,"--I take it... it's April 15, for the last year, right."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1286.016,1286.557,--Yes.
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.557,1287.248,No problem.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1290.48,1291.379,In either court.
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.379,1292.101,In either court.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1309.18,1310.091,"No, I don't think so."
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.124,1314.056,I don't mean to be pejorative.
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1314.056,1315.857,Let me explain why... because they don't have to go to tax court.
1995.94-1785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.857,1317.099,"No, no, wait."
1995.94-1785,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1352.314,1356.666,"I don't think there's an answer to the last part of your point, and that's what I'd like to address."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1631.551,1634.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1785,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.937,1685.867,"Well, the Solicitor General said that the code does define a return."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1688.049,1690.072,"--The code does not define a return, Your Honor."
1995.94-1785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1690.072,1706.38,"But the one thing the code clearly does is distinguish, at least in 6511, between claim and return, so presumably it... there is no reason, I guess, to assume that it was... that it was assuming a possible identity."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1706.38,1710.995,"Your Honor, a claim and a return can be different documents."
1995.94-1785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1738.632,1750.659,"Before you give me the reasons, would you respond to this (b)(3)(C) deals specifically with the case in which a return has been filed."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1758.487,1760.029,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1995.94-1785,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.859,1783.495,"Well, certainly you'd read (C), which comes right along next to it and also contains the word claim, in deciding what claim means in (B)."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1785.896,1793.98,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the claim in (B) still has to be a valid claim, and I would like to explain what a valid claim has to be."
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.98,1796.982,"Before you do that, you've left me in some confusion."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1809.151,1810.643,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, I devoted--"
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.643,1822.25,"He claimed... well, he is questioning whether the claim might not constitute a return."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1834.127,1834.979,--Your Honor--
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.979,1838.61,"I mean, do you think the claim constitutes the return, or the later return constitutes the claim?"
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1838.61,1840.593,"--Your Honor, we have alternative arguments."
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.359,1854.05,"Yes, I understand that."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1854.891,1855.532,All right... okay.
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.532,1856.792,--with what's the claim and what's the return.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1857.483,1858.094,Your Honor--
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.094,1861.246,"--as far as the word claim and return, I thought your position was the later return was the claim."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1861.246,1877.796,"--We've devoted four or five or six pages of our brief to the question of, if it is assumed that there is a deemed claim, if that's what the language means, and we don't concede that, then the deemed claim must have been a valid claim, and the only valid claim that could be filed under these circumstances--"
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.796,1878.567,Is the later return.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1878.567,1879.576,--is a return.
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.576,1882.618,"Yes, and that's not what Justice Stevens was questioning about at all."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1885.711,1890.615,"Perhaps I misunderstood him, but the core issue with respect to this statute is what is meant by the word claim."
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.51,1963.882,--The Government's position is that (b)(3)(B) doesn't refer to any real claim.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,1965.863,1970.468,"--Well, it's... even if it's a hypothetical claim, it has to be something, and it has to be a valid claim."
1995.94-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.55,2001.126,"Mr. Schwartz, under your interpretation, when would section 6512(b)(3)(B) ever act as a bar to claiming a refund?"
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2001.126,2013.295,"Your Honor, if the notice of deficiency was mailed more than 3 years from the due date of the return, that would be at a time when the taxpayer could not have--"
1995.94-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.295,2016.597,But you don't look to that subsection to give me that answer.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2021.582,2024.742,"--I don't understand the question, Your Honor."
1995.94-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.664,2037.63,"It just seemed to me that under your interpretation, (b)(3)(B) just would never apply to give effect to your--"
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2038.492,2060.696,"--Your Honor, our view of 6512(b)(3)(B) is that it's basically... if the statute of limitations was open to the taxpayer on the date that the notice was mailed, then it's open to him in the tax court, that he... the tax court can grant him a refund, so if the notice was mailed after 3 years from the due date, then under no circumstances could the taxpayer recover."
1995.94-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.696,2062.649,"Well, I think everybody agrees with that."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2069.963,2072.275,That's correct.
1995.94-1785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.462,2126.239,"On that... in that same vein, then can you tell us under what circumstances the 2-year look back would apply when the Commissioner... when the Commissioner sends a notice of deficiency?"
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2131.404,2148.905,"--The 2-year look back would come into play the same way it would come into play if we were not dealing with the tax court, and that is where the 2 years from the date the tax is paid provides for a longer period of limitation than 3 years from the date the return was filed, and that could come up in connection with an audit."
1995.94-1785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.394,2184.807,"So your view of the 2-year look back is, it can only work to the taxpayers advantage--"
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2184.807,2185.848,That is correct.
1995.94-1785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2185.848,2193.015,--when it turns out to be longer than the 3 years from the return filing.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2193.015,2193.656,That is correct.
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.978,2228.168,"How do you square your notion that claim means a valid claim, that is, a claim accompanying a return, with the language of 6511(a), which says a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment in respect to which the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed within 3 years, blah, blah, blah, and then at the end of that sentence, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer within 2 years from the time the tax was paid."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2233.42,2241.225,"Your Honor, there are several reasons why that second 2-year rule does not apply to a taxpayer who's required to file a return."
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.225,2252.163,"I'm not... I don't want to know when the 2-year rule... I want to know how it squares with your notion that when the statute says claim, it means a valid claim, that is, a claim accompanied by a tax return."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2254.023,2261.457,My principle is that a valid claim for refund where no original return has been filed must be on a tax return.
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.457,2262.558,Must be on a tax return.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2269.144,2270.844,That's for nonreturn required taxes.
1995.94-1785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.01,2279.629,It doesn't read that way.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2286.864,2289.346,"Your Honor, may I explain?"
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.651,2477.903,I don't really see how you avoid the language.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2507.081,2508.804,You're talking about the--
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.804,2515.278,"Of (B), the key language here, 6512(b)(3)(B)."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2515.278,2516.288,--Oh--
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.288,2529.828,"It looks like... the question, it seemed to me is whether that comma after (d) means that you should read the if like a which, whereas they want to read it like a that, and I don't see how you can avoid it, to tell you the truth."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2547.621,2548.402,--Well--
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.402,2550.503,But I can't think of any other way to do it.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2550.503,2553.665,"--Your Honor, I d like to get back to the claim."
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.796,2555.407,Yes.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2557.969,2558.54,--Right.
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.348,2573.878,"But the difficulty with that is that only the section before they talk about claims and they talk about returns, and there's a whole phrase there that doesn't make too much sense unless they mean to leave open the possibility that you could have a claim that didn't have a return."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2573.878,2574.438,--Well--
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.438,2579.961,But then is there any other... are you... is there any other reading of this language that gets you where you want?
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2579.961,2584.445,"--Well, the legislative history."
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.445,2600.754,"I understand... I like legislative history, too, but nonetheless you do have to deal with the language that they enacted, and that's why I'm looking to see is there any other reading of that language, other than a claim including the word return, that will get you where you want to go."
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2600.754,2608.301,"Well, Your Honor, the IRS has contended that the language is plain throughout the litigation, but it is not plain."
1995.94-1785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.416,2619.097,It doesn't.
1995.94-1785,1,26081,glenn_p_schwartz,,2619.638,2620.069,If.
1995.94-1785,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3371.492,3373.842,Thank you.
1995.94-1785,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3455.124,3460.698,"--The question, Mr. Jones... you can answer yes or no... can a taxpayer dismiss a petition filed with the tax court?"
1995.94-1785,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3460.698,3462.449,If I could answer yes or no--
