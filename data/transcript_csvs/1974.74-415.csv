1974.74-415,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.184,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-415, Rondeau against Mosinee Paper Corporation."
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,35.783,39.759,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.233,148.317,The 13D has to be filed with the company and with the exchange and --
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,148.317,148.856,Yes.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,148.856,150.437,-- with the commission.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,150.437,151.12,Correct.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,151.12,153.389,And where else if anywhere?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,153.389,154.497,That's all.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.497,160.096,And how the shareholders readily and promptly get knowledge of this?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,160.096,168.18,Usually through information from management if it is filed and has a pretender offer matter.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.144,179.192,Neither the commissioner of the exchange normally makes any effort to disseminate the information to the shareholder.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,179.192,191.587,That's correct but of course the exchange and the commission do have rules regarding what management must publicize and this might be considered such relevant information and management might be required to publicize in certain circumstances.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,191.587,196.545,And would -- it would often be seemed to be and management's interest to publicize it too.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,196.545,197.228,It might be.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.228,200.006,Yes.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,200.006,209.707,The District Court concluded that there was no issue of material fact as to the propositions which it included in its opinion under the heading facts.
1974.74-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.199,236.433,So that Judges Doyle's statement of facts is basically as not findings of fact but statements of fact that were undisputed.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,236.433,240.589,That is my position and that is the way he states it.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.696,399.726,There's a schedule?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,399.726,400.439,Yes there was.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.439,401.631,After the institution.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,401.631,410.487,"Yes, in late September Mr. Rondeau filed an amended -- an amendment to his schedule."
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.799,431.637,That is among himself and these various corporations.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,431.637,432.116,Right.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,460.195,467.464,Would the amendment for the first time indicate that his purpose might be the acquisition of control of the company?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,467.464,468.393,No.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,863.029,871.94,Has there been any litigation by any of the shareholders who sold their stock to your client after May and before August?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,871.94,879.0,"There was a suit filed by the Valley Trust Company, I may have the name on."
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.601,921.253,"And the class, the asserted class is the shareholders who sold their stock to Mr. Rondeau from the time of his violation until the time he made that 13D."
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,921.253,922.93,Yes I --
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,922.93,923.523,Is that it?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,923.523,932.619,"Mr. Justice, I am not certain whether it is sold to Rondeau or sold stock period but it is one of those two."
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,932.619,939.649,This I suppose was a -- had been irrelatively inactive over the counter market for this type?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,939.649,944.374,"Well, I don't know the trading history, I think it was treated relatively actively."
1974.74-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.843,1038.136,Mr. Beckwith.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1038.136,1041.25,Excuse me Justice Rehnquist.
1974.74-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.25,1047.358,Did judge Pell's dissent indicates that an appeal to the Seventh Circuit.
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1081.987,1090.879,"Well in our reply brief, we suggest that their -- that the issue was not raised in the petition for certiorari."
1974.74-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.565,1128.14,Whatever Mr. Rondeau's motive might have been --
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1128.14,1153.27,"That's right, I think there is ample evidence and if the Court is inclined to review the facts de novo which I think would be unwise but if that were to happen, there is ample evidence to support Judge Doyle's conclusions and the arguments of that or the description of that will be found in our Seventh Circuit brief which is, I had directed this file here for your examination."
1974.74-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.27,1164.731,"Talk about ample evidence to support a judge's conclusions, it sounds like you're talking about something which is occurred after a trial and findings of fact."
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1164.731,1167.785,I appreciate that and that's been the argument of Mosinee's counsel.
1974.74-415,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1340.781,1348.44,"Mr. Beckwith, if you prevail here what incentive is there left for anyone to file a form?"
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1348.44,1352.895,Well there's ample incentive as this case well illustrates.
1974.74-415,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1527.037,1529.097,Is Tristate Motor out of the Eighth Circuit?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1529.097,1530.259,Yes.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.259,1531.93,"340, isn't it, under the rule?"
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1531.93,1532.223,Yes.
1974.74-415,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1536.505,1541.02,Was that in a precedent under the Eighth Circuit rule or they don't publish it?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1541.02,1548.649,I don't think so and it was cited in our petition for certiorari and was cited in our brief.
1974.74-415,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1553.074,1559.272,"Whether it's precedent or not in that circuit, it is at least arguably a conflict in point of view."
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1559.272,1560.434,"Oh, I think that's correct."
1974.74-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.823,1579.883,Would you -- injunction and adhere attached to the respective voting of the stock and no matter whose hands the stock was?
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1579.883,1583.027,Well it's not clear but presumably it does.
1974.74-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.309,1603.968,"So if he tried to sell, a purchaser might be -- might not be so enthusiastic."
1974.74-415,0,20806,david_ebeckwith,,1603.968,1605.968,Could well be.
1974.74-415,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.897,1628.921,Very well Mr. Beckwith.
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,1631.61,1633.58,Mr. Hammond Your Honor.
1974.74-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.892,1685.754,"Well then, where did the Seventh Circuit get its findings from if it didn't adopt Judge Doyle's?"
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,1685.754,1698.658,"Got its findings, Mr. Justice Rehnquist from giving do deference to most of the claims of innocence of Mr. Rondeau and the facts that were before it on the record that came up."
1974.74-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.83,1719.052,"So in effect, it resolved all doubts in favor of Mr. Rondeau and still said an injunction was warranted."
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,1719.052,1721.142,That's what I believe they did.
1974.74-415,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.864,1814.397,And those people are the plaintiffs in this -- aren't the plaintiffs in this case.
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,1814.397,1816.613,That's correct Justice Stewart.
1974.74-415,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.962,2048.891,"If Congress had intended that Mr. Hammond, it would been a very easy matter for them to written identity act, would it not?"
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2048.891,2064.728,"That's true Justice Burger but by the same token, Congress has not written in to the act many of the rights that have been pursued under the Securities Law, under Section 10 (b) 5, under Section 16 (b), under short swing profits, they do not in fact establish --"
1974.74-415,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.728,2083.931,"Well but when you're departing from a very firmly established traditional remedy of equity in the form of an injunction, so what the difference is it can -- some of the other factors are moving to?"
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2083.931,2085.812,I don't think so Justice Burger.
1974.74-415,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.07,2108.645,All of it or just the excess over 5% or what --
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2108.645,2133.784,"I think if the situation were aggravated enough, all of it, if he -- if the facts were to disclose, that this was a concerted plan, a device for requiring control of the company and the level of acquisition had achieved the level of control for instance that under those circumstances, he could be required to dispose off all of it."
1974.74-415,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.51,2208.75,"Like as conceded, isn't it?"
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2208.75,2210.001,Well I'm not so sure it is conceded.
1974.74-415,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.001,2211.588,And he violated the law that it clearly --
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2211.588,2212.516,It's concededly violated.
1974.74-415,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2212.516,2215.211,"Expressly, explicitly violated the law."
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2215.211,2224.912,But it's not conceded that he is painted as an innocent mistaken individual.
1974.74-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.715,2275.398,"Well if we were going to speculate about the facts here, one speculation would be that if he knew about this law, he certainly would have complied with it because he had absolutely nothing to gain from not complying."
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2275.398,2280.242,But there is a substantial benefit to achieve by not complying.
1974.74-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.875,2331.659,But I thought it was the management that called his attention to the fact that it might be in legal trouble.
1974.74-415,1,34234,laurence_chammond_jr,,2331.659,2362.645,"And that's true because the management's obligation is to advise the public and to see that Mr. Rondeau when they find out that he is engaging a violation advise the public and it was in this instance, the management that advised him on July 30th when it finally discovered or did not even discover, guessed based upon putting together a lot of facts that Mr. Rondeau in fact was in violation that they said ""we think we have a securities problem here."""
1974.74-415,2,20806,david_ebeckwith,,3580.006,3583.659,Just a few points Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3622.227,3625.025,Even if it doesn't ultimately take over.
1974.74-415,2,20806,david_ebeckwith,,3625.025,3625.678,That's correct.
1974.74-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.678,3627.019,Plus the --
1974.74-415,2,20806,david_ebeckwith,,3627.019,3631.54,"His lurking presence, effective lurking presence maybe helpful."
1974.74-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3828.318,3829.156,Thank you gentleman.
