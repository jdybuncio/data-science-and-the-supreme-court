2008.07-499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-499, Negusie v. Mukasey."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,7.404,30.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A father forced at gunpoint to engage in incest with his daughter because of his religion, race, or political views, and told that he and his daughter will be killed if he refuses, is far outside the class of persons brought to mind by the ordinary meaning of the phrase at issue in this case, which is reprinted on page 1 of our brief, quoting from section (a) 42):"
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,84.616,89.187,Do we begin with the assumption that this is a Chevron deference case?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,100.876,107.481,"Well, I think under Chevron that, one, the first question is is there a gap to be filled here?"
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,108.131,110.35,"Well, do I begin with Chevron?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,110.35,112.683,"--Well, yes."
2008.07-499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,127.793,138.267,"I take it your position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity in some abstract sense?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,138.267,156.978,"--Yes, our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the phrase here, using the principle that the Court applied in Watson and looking at the phrase and looking at the picture that it brings to mind, would never bring to mind the examples that I cited as conduct that would be captured by this provision."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.978,168.286,"Mr. Pincus, could I ask about your description of the Government's position as saying that it's purely objective and that there's no mental factor whatever."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,183.296,185.229,There are cases--
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.229,187.998,--that he was persecuting somebody?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,187.998,193.917,"--Yes, Your Honor, there are cases, some of which that determination has been reversed by a court of appeals."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.103,198.738,Has the Government taken that position here in in this case?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,198.738,205.875,"--The -- well, we pointed out that that is the position that the BIA has taken and the Government has not disavowed it."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.827,209.363,I guess I should ask the Government?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,209.363,210.546,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.552,230.526,I could think that that's wrong without thinking that you also have to take into account whether there was coercion.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,230.526,246.886,"You could, Your Honor, although the underlying -- the Government's underlying theory for all three of its positions, both that coercion doesn't matter, that knowledge doesn't matter, and that subjective intent doesn't matter, is its view that these words require only objective acts."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.419,260.527,"Well, but it's very -- it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require knowledge of the act."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,285.025,286.761,"--Well, two responses, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,323.95,327.235,Your position is that any threat of serious injury is sufficient?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,327.235,328.435,--Excuse me?
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,328.435,334.306,Your position is that any threat of serious injury is sufficient?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,334.306,335.591,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.191,340.627,But that's what your brief says:
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,347.697,352.149,"--Yes, and our position is that that's a logical starting point."
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.947,393.076,"If someone said, if you don't -- there are 500 men, women and children in a shed; if you don't administer lethal gas to them, we are going to administer 20 lashes, that would be sufficient in your view?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,393.076,408.901,"Well, under some -- under some conceptions of this defense, there is a balancing test between the threat that is directed against the individual and the threat -- and what the injury that he is asked to carry out."
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,410.103,411.487,"Well, that's not very helpful."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,416.174,428.565,"Well, what the courts have said in the criminal context is that there are three criteria: An immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury; a well-grounded fear that it will be carried out; and no reasonable opportunity to escape."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.434,432.367,So you wouldn't balance.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,437.003,439.003,--It might be appropriate--
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.003,441.372,"You gas the 20,000 people, right, and that's okay?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,441.372,453.596,"--Well, some courts have said that murder is a different kettle of fish and that there is a question unanswered in the Federal system about whether or not there is a direct defense for murder."
2008.07-499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.163,486.901,Why shouldn't the starting point be what this Court decided in the Fedorenko case?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,503.529,506.897,"Well, Your Honor, two responses to that."
2008.07-499,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.512,549.974,"It was also the distinction about the use of the word ""voluntary"", in which the operative language which barred those people didn't have ""voluntary"" in it, and I forget what it was, the next textual section it was there, so it was reason to infer that voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,550.76,566.769,"Exactly, Your Honor, and the Court said the deliberate omission -- it specifically looked at the fact that these sections were adopted at the same time, followed on each other immediately, and one had ""voluntary"", and then it said this was a deliberate omission and we conclude that that deliberate omission provides the basis for interpreting the language--"
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.769,577.91,Do you take the position that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to send it back?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,577.91,578.893,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,598.157,606.311,"And do we begin with the decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision--"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,606.311,606.894,Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.894,607.929,--which cited Fedorenko?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,607.929,610.048,Rodriguez-Majano was the first one.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.913,647.471,"Well, to give the devil his due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it means, right?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,647.471,648.204,Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.204,668.266,"So you are faulting the BIA for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to address the matter has said?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,668.266,671.819,"I think there are -- there are two different questions here, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.051,697.118,Why do you think that's clear?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,699.553,710.61,"--The text that we are relying on is -- is the actual decision, which just makes a flat statement, again in dicta: ""The participation or"" -- I am reading from Rodriguez-Majano."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.61,713.312,Do I have it in front of me?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,713.312,713.679,You don't.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.979,715.412,"Well, gee."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,719.633,729.239,"Well, actually the language is on page 27 of our yellow brief."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.239,731.108,Wonderful.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,731.108,735.81,At the very top of the page.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.518,751.803,"It's a ""see"" citation, right?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,751.803,752.503,--Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.503,759.207,"Well, I mean, you know, it's just not a flat citation which would say that governs."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,771.098,772.963,"Well, Your Honor, it is certainly--"
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.963,778.751,And that's all you have to say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,778.751,780.203,--Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.553,782.336,That's not very much.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,782.336,783.905,--the statement in this decision is dicta.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.023,839.908,"It's a ""see"" cite again, isn't it?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,839.908,840.775,"--It's another ""see"" cite."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.775,842.027,"All right, that's good."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,842.027,844.979,"Which they indicate because they are actually directly -- well, anyway."
2008.07-499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.962,905.795,I'm sorry.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,910.616,912.068,I apologize.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.77,923.191,"You say ""Citing Matter of Laipenieks""?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,923.191,924.376,Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.376,924.943,Citing it.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,929.495,931.713,"That I don't know, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.713,934.564,Do you want to bet?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,934.564,936.516,"I'm betting on ""see""."
2008.07-499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.516,948.841,"If -- if they say that the plain language of the statute dictates a particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,948.841,949.891,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.677,981.129,"Mr. Pincus, can you tell me: What is the consequence of this?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1025.758,1026.958,--He gets to stay here--
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.958,1033.514,"--Until some other country other than the one that will persecute him will receive him, is that -- is that it?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1033.514,1034.064,--Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.976,1052.626,"Oh, really?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1052.626,1053.678,--the CAT would not protect you.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.722,1074.022,Okay.
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1074.022,1078.626,Let me ask you -- let me ask you about another practical consequence of your position.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1134.177,1143.199,"Yes, Your Honor, just -- just as in the initial question about whether someone has been subject to persecution in the first place, that's -- that is the process that we have."
2008.07-499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1150.936,1152.655,You really think that's true?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1155.173,1157.04,"--Well, I think -- I think it is their job."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.219,1180.372,"Well, if I claim I would be subject to persecution in Denmark if I were sent there, that might be an easy question."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1180.372,1193.465,"--But they typically come from a country where there is persecution, and they could easily have been subjected to it, or they could also just as easily have read about it or heard about it in -- along their way here."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.331,1220.865,Your unprovable question upon unprovable question.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1227.603,1248.267,"And -- and we also think it's significant in this respect, that the Secretary of Homeland Security has in connection with a different disability, the material support disability, said that, promulgated an exclusion for -- in some circumstances for people who are coerced to provide material support."
2008.07-499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.267,1252.235,"I am quite curious why -- I am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question ""yes""?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1269.113,1271.798,"That's absolutely right, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.798,1275.5,"If that's right, then why do you not -- why was your answer yes?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1275.5,1279.571,My answer was in the absence of action by the Attorney General.
2008.07-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.514,1301.518,"Mr. Pincus, refresh my recollection about something about the Fedorenko case, which I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in detail."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1321.795,1325.866,"Yes, I think that's -- that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.545,1353.433,"Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I didn't get the bottom line of your exchange with Justice Breyer."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1368.276,1369.309,Yes.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.309,1376.214,"And only if you were threatened with torture, not if it was threatened that your family would be exterminated?"
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1380.583,1385.654,"Well, the Attorney General has rulemaking authority in the asylum area, certainly."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.106,1390.474,Any old coercion defense he can do -- make.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1394.86,1398.628,"--Well, we think the question now before the Court is, is there no coercion defense?"
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.116,1407.401,But why does the Attorney General have expertise in -- in that area?
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1430.183,1437.705,"Well, it -- it -- it seems to me it could well -- I mean, obviously, that would be a question that would come up, but -- but given that--"
2008.07-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.705,1440.824,I don't know why you -- I don't know why you concede that.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1440.824,1446.978,"--Well, I think once there is a coercion defense, it would be fleshed out in the administrative process."
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.978,1450.097,You said -- you never get past step one of Chevron.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1454.249,1455.166,Absolutely.
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.383,1462.754,"I think it's pretty ambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion defense, but we don't really know what it is."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1462.754,1464.106,--Well--
2008.07-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.106,1475.478,"It seems to me if you are going to say step one is clear, there has to be some coercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a substantial nature that the Attorney General cannot fritter away."
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1475.478,1479.449,"--We agree with that, Your Honor, and I apologize if I suggested to the contrary."
2008.07-499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.449,1481.499,What would be -- what would be the minimum.
2008.07-499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1506.099,1529.049,"Because the statutory context here was to implement our treaty obligations, and the treaty obligations refers -- refer to criminal conduct -- we think the logical starting point that -- that you are asking about, Justice Ginsburg, would be the criminal law standards, which, as I say, are well developed in the Federal system."
2008.07-499,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.049,1530.332,Serious bodily harm?

2008.07-499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.058,1545.958,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1561.936,1579.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In categorical terms, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that persons who assist or otherwise participate in persecution may not obtain certain immigration benefits."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.314,1581.647,"Where you stopped -- you stopped in the part that interests me,"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1606.132,1613.619,"No, but the -- the Mr. Chief Justice, modifies the ""persecution""."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.487,1618.339,"Well, how do you know that?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1638.686,1644.757,"--I think grammatically, the immediately preceding noun is ""persecution""."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.372,1673.407,"Well, that just bring you back to what ""assistance"" means."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1680.097,1680.613,--Right.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.613,1689.203,"""Assistance"" can be read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms of an active -- I don't know what it is -- predisposition or desire."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1701.926,1711.116,"I don't -- I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, in that the question here -- the question here is the availability of a duress defense."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.722,1757.93,"Well, but that argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney General can exercise his discretion and not afford relief."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1768.738,1773.19,The Attorney General does not have discretion with respect to withholding.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.958,1888.313,"And so too would, I gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he doesn't build the prison walls, right?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1895.817,1896.584,But the point--
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.584,1899.669,Does he -- does he persecute people on account of race?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1899.669,1900.371,--Well--
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.371,1907.359,"We have a prison here; we are going to hold members of a particular racial group here, and we are going to force you to build the walls."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1907.359,1915.131,"--Mr. Chief Justice, you are absolutely correct that there will, of course, be hard cases about how broadly to draw the circle."
2008.07-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.407,1933.176,"Well, but your position is that it is unbounded."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1946.834,1954.423,"--Of course, Justice Kennedy, Congress could pass a statute with whatever--"
2008.07-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.423,1956.208,I'm saying in the general criminal law.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,1972.101,1976.269,--That's true in the context of criminal law.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.74,2011.357,Why not any statute?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2021.882,2022.615,Exactly.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.615,2034.04,"--and you will discover, of course, that your word ""involuntary"" is never something where the action is involuntary that we praise or blame people."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2067.077,2068.446,"Justice Breyer, the case--"
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.446,2069.246,Are covered.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2069.246,2070.563,--Two points.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.219,2077.702,All right.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2081.921,2082.387,Okay.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.387,2084.289,And are you going to have intentional actions?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2084.289,2084.839,Yes.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.839,2098.882,"Because praise or blame typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional action, and an action where there is a degree of freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too skewed."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2118.462,2125.466,Because the thousand-year tradition that you correctly identify is a criminal law tradition.
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2125.466,2127.652,"Oh, but Aristotle doesn't say criminal law."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2129.852,2137.84,"Justice Breyer, this is a statute -- this is a statute that allocates immigration benefits."
2008.07-499,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.742,2143.325,That's absolutely right.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2149.981,2160.336,"--The question -- with respect to intentional conduct, the conduct at issue here, Justice Breyer, is knowing and intentional."
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.436,2167.49,"No, the reasoning here, Mr. Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what Justice Breyer brings up."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2259.016,2277.145,"--I -- I don't know why it -- with respect to the BIA's reasoning, this decision is a straightforward application of 20 years of BIA precedent concluding -- consistent with Fedorenko that voluntariness is not relevant matter."
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2277.145,2278.995,This is not really consistency with Fedorenko.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2306.664,2308.214,Right.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2311.883,2313.385,Which answers Justice Breyer's question.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2313.385,2318.055,--But the -- I may be missing some of the subtlety of your point.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2318.655,2320.005,"I doubt it, but go ahead."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2320.271,2321.371,--Let me try it this way.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2341.651,2342.084,Right.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2342.084,2379.11,"Many courts of appeals and the BIA repeatedly over the last 20 years have held that the reasoning that Fedorenko governs not only the displaced person's act, where it is of course directly controlling, but subsequent statutes, of which there are no fewer than seven, using essentially the identical formulation of assistance in persecution: Congress carries forward that formulation in a canonical way statute after statute."
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2397.655,2411.796,"But one thing that Congress has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually that the DPA made in Fedorenko."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2438.494,2443.314,"Identical or not textually distinguishable, to the extent that--"
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2443.314,2453.586,"Well, you don't have the voluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute in Fedorenko, do you?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2453.586,2458.288,"--You -- well, you have the same operative language of assisting persecution."
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.288,2465.125,"You don't -- you don't follow that with the section that uses the word ""voluntary"", whereas the bar does not use the word ""voluntary"", right?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2465.125,2466.726,Except you do.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2483.438,2484.055,Can you--
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2484.055,2484.621,And they--
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2484.621,2490.592,--Can you give me a couple of examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the same distinction here as under the DPA?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2490.592,2491.775,--Sure.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.019,2510.255,Was that passed as part of the same legislation that created the bar section we are dealing with?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2510.255,2512.122,--Yes and no.
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2559.236,2589.172,"But it's -- I don't want to split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with respect to, in effect, an election under existing federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2589.172,2607.502,"--That's a fair point, Justice Souter, but to the extent part of the reasoning in Fedorenko rests on the -- and the inference from the contrast, those same contrasts are present here where -- the point of the example--"
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2607.502,2618.894,"You have convinced me there are contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts that raise the implication in a clear way as it was raised in the DPA."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2622.096,2622.662,"--Well, you have--"
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.662,2625.048,"Mr. Katsas, can I bring you back to Aristotle?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2627.231,2628.249,--Absolutely.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.249,2628.899,Thank you.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2632.701,2633.903,Exactly.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.903,2637.355,The government is not imposing punishment upon this person--
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2637.355,2638.071,Exactly.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.071,2641.64,--for some malfeasance.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2647.627,2648.496,Exactly.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.496,2649.579,--to a class of people.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2681.884,2682.567,That's--
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.567,2685.102,--Did Aristotle say anything about that?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2686.102,2687.871,--I'm not sure.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.871,2696.827,--Limiting the nation's generosity on the basis of a provision that may or may not have anything to do with blame?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2696.827,2700.346,"I don't know what Aristotle had to say about it, but--"
2008.07-499,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.346,2703.964,"But you do know that Aristotle was not construing this Federal statute, don't you?"
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2705.666,2713.771,"Well, speaking of -- to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying, you have a clause that says ""otherwise participated"", right?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2713.771,2714.288,--Right.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2714.288,2727.096,"So that must mean, I gather, or could mean that ""assisted"" does not have as broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the ""otherwise participated"" language would be unnecessary and redundant."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2727.096,2747.843,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because the statutory sequence is the word 1977 -- when Congress changes ""assist"" to ""assists or otherwise participates in""--"
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2747.843,2748.393,Right.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2748.393,2752.913,"--the only consequence of that, if any, could be a broadening, not a narrowing."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2752.913,2777.879,"Well, I'm not sure that's right, because if ""otherwise participated"" covers -- ""assisted"" does not include ""otherwise participated"", and I understood your broad reading of ""assisted"" to cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say ""assisted"" needs to be interpreted with ""ordered"" and ""incited"", and if it is, then ""otherwise participated"" should be interpreted along the same lines."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2777.879,2786.551,"Mr. Chief Justice, the word ""assist"" was construed in Fedorenko not to -- not to contain an implicit voluntariness exception."
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2795.073,2799.977,So you think there was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2799.977,2807.714,--Either belt-and-suspenders or broadening the circle in ways that are difficult to describe in the abstract.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.76,2827.895,"What I may have missed, what was your answer to the prison walls?"
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2829.68,2830.014,Yes.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.014,2834.031,Is he or is he not participating in the persecution?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2834.031,2859.997,"My answer is that the analysis of that question does not turn on whether or not he is compelled to build the prison walls; it turns on footnote 34 of Fedorenko, which says that courts will have to draw difficult lines in distinguishing between the kind of aid that constitutes assistance within the meaning of the statute and the kind of aid that does not."
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.997,2860.682,That's very helpful.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2861.899,2863.649,But--
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2863.649,2871.671,You -- can I get from you an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2889.882,2904.809,"--In this case, Justice Scalia, our position is that knowledge is a sufficient mens rea and is clearly satisfied here where Petitioner, by his own testimony, knew about the mistreatment."
2008.07-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.809,2906.076,What is your answer to the question?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2906.076,2912.915,"We have taken the position, Justice Stevens, in other cases, that knowledge is not required."
2008.07-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.915,2913.648,All right.
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2913.648,2916.617,It's been rejected by a few courts of appeals.
2008.07-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.617,2917.986,Good for them.

2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2951.456,2955.325,--The question -- I'm not sure the distinction.
2008.07-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.325,2959.194,"You say that, do you not, that with a case involving lack of knowledge."
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,2959.194,2960.812,Or intent.

2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,3071.731,3072.181,Right.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.181,3080.087,--And it suggests to me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under Chevron step two.

2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,3177.78,3179.065,I would not say that.
2008.07-499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.215,3187.42,"You would view that as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the person is not going to be executed unless the woman does her job?"

2008.07-499,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3241.472,3252.547,--What -- what about the position that the displaced person's act was special to the Holocaust?
2008.07-499,1,25604,gregory_g_katsas,,3299.861,3319.838,"--Justice Ginsburg, it's true that the Displaced Persons Act was limited to the Nazi regime, and later statutes, the Refugee Act generalizes in the sense of eliminating the time and place restrictions on the definition of refugee."

2008.07-499,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.72,3393.186,The applicant would.
2008.07-499,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3409.165,3410.182,Yes.

2008.07-499,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.992,3455.111,And do they have shifty eyes?
2008.07-499,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3456.061,3457.729,But these are -- I mean--
2008.07-499,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3457.729,3464.8,Do they typically have views on the underlying persecution issue that is at issue?
