1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.028,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94 805, George W. Bush v. Al Vera, William Lawson v. Al Vera, and United States v. Al Vera."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,11.52,13.8,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.138,58.07,"Mr. Aguilar, what is this opportunity district?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,59.59,62.841,"Well, it's a majority minority district that was created under--"
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,62.841,65.663,Why don't we just call them majority minority districts?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,81.755,82.146,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.146,82.676,Thank you.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,82.676,83.855,I'll refer to them as majority minority districts.
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.652,120.661,"That's pretty much a question of fact, isn't it, Mr. Aguilar, whether it was basically a desire to preserve incumbency or whether it was the desire to create majority minority districts?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,120.661,140.884,"--Well, yes, sir, it is a question of fact, Your Honor, but in this case... they decided this case before Miller v. Johnson, and I think their opinion is clear that they did not believe that incumbency protection should be considered a traditional districting principle because it was not among those listed in the Shaw v. Reno case to begin with."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,197.04,207.448,"Okay, but Mr. Aguilar, you made this argument, I take it, to the district court, and you can see it's a question of fact as to what the motivation for drawing... and the district court rejected those findings."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,210.071,210.739,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.201,240.588,"Well, but Mr. Aguilar, the district court did make findings that the districts were formed in utter disregard for traditional redistricting criteria, and were unexplainable on other than racial grounds."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,247.855,259.903,"--Those findings are tainted, Your Honor, by the legal error in not recognizing that the State of Texas has a long tradition of protecting incumbents, and that--"
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.903,265.637,"Well, do you argue that protection of incumbents is a compelling State interest?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,265.637,266.057,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,268.048,272.74,You're just saying it's a traditional State interest that is followed in Texas--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,272.74,273.28,--It is something--
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.28,274.001,--in drawing districts.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,274.001,275.972,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.828,284.108,Well--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,284.108,284.637,--that the State utilized.
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.637,291.602,"--all right, but you did present evidence to the district court of protection of incumbency."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,309.645,320.311,"Yes, Your Honor, and if I may, they certainly considered that, and they even acknowledged in their opinion that incumbency protection was a major objective in the State, all over the State."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.311,320.852,Right.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,320.852,342.116,"And they didn't particularly like it, and they said as much, but despite the fact that 24 out of the 30 districts, Justice O'Connor, were challenged on these grounds, only these three districts were found to be racially gerrymandered, and I'd like to point to the Court... refer to the Court to Joint Appendix at page 192."
1995.94-805,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,345.919,352.772,"Mr. Aguilar, before you do that, remind me... I think you mentioned it just a moment ago."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,380.571,382.792,"Are you asking in the Shaw opinion, Your Honor?"
1995.94-805,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.792,384.374,"No, in this opinion."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,384.374,391.438,I think it recognized that it was a motivation of the legislature all over the State.
1995.94-805,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.321,399.982,Did it treat it as something that could dominate?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,409.9,410.911,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,426.193,427.652,Let me... may I ask you to go one step further?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,482.647,483.217,--That is--
1995.94-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.217,483.938,Is that fair?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,483.938,485.738,"--That is exactly correct, Justice Souter."
1995.94-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,485.738,492.133,"Counsel, I want you to get to section... to page 192, but let me ask you one question before you do that."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,506.563,510.006,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.216,538.573,"Well, suppose I say I want to protect incumbents and, incidentally, I take it this means any incumbent who is an officeholder can protect his or her interests by running for some other office."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,557.587,568.372,"Well, if the predominant motivation is just collecting as many minorities that you can within one district, and you don't care whether it protects your incumbents, you don't care about--"
1995.94-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.372,569.564,"No, no, that's not my hypothetical."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,586.976,588.708,"--I think it would, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.112,595.932,"Well, that's one of the things we're going to ask."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,595.932,615.205,"--Well, in our... for instance, if we had a case where there was no reason to create this district... in other words, there was very little reason to create a majority minority district under the Voting Rights Act, then I would say we would be running afoul of this Court's ruling in Miller, but when you have a situation where--"
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.205,639.11,"Well now, Mr. Aguilar, was there evidence here that majority minority districts could have been drawn in 18, 29, and 30 that would have been more compact, and that would not have presented this racial gerrymander problem, and nevertheless have satisfied some of the incumbents?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,639.11,641.282,--Let me--
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,641.282,642.18,"I mean, there were proposals made--"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,642.18,642.741,"--That's correct, there were."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,642.741,643.522,--were there not--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,643.522,644.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,644.103,647.727,--That still would have provided majority minority districts for--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,647.727,647.864,Yes.
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,647.864,650.508,--blacks and Hispanics.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,650.508,651.067,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.067,658.173,"But wouldn't have been drawn, you know, house to house to pick up certain particular voters in the racial base."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,658.173,668.398,"Well, they weren't drawn house to house, Your Honor, but yes, there was in the evidence... in fact, the State itself presented alternative districts in these three areas that were geographically more compact."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.266,696.287,"Yes, so this case doesn't present, does it, a situation where Texas had no means of assuring a racial composition and balance, even if these peculiar districts are tossed out?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,696.287,697.178,"--Well, that's right."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.481,704.282,"Does that go to narrow tailoring, do you suppose?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,704.282,704.973,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,704.973,705.434,No.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,705.434,706.034,Our position--
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,706.034,707.724,I would have thought it might.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,707.724,723.555,"--Well, our position on narrow tailoring is that once there is a reason to draw the districts under the Voting Rights Act, the narrow tailoring means you just draw the district that's necessary that affords that group an opportunity to elect someone of their choosing."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.555,724.845,"You mean, the number of districts?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,724.845,727.228,"The number of districts, that's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.228,736.903,"What would be an example of broad tailoring, then, once you find that the... you want to draw those kinds of... are there any kind of boundary lines you can't have?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,736.903,742.258,"Well, I think that... I guess the best example would be in the Miller case."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.481,775.778,So you do recognize that narrow tailoring would outlaw some kinds of districts drawn after a decision to draw majority minority... but you say this is narrowly tailored in your case.
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,775.778,789.039,"--It's narrowly tailored because we first of all realized that there was a sufficiently large minority population in a geographically compact area, and there was racially polarized voting."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.767,805.317,Do you--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,805.317,807.118,"--and people don't want to... sorry, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.118,820.809,"--If, in fact... suppose for the sake of argument that it was accepted that under Miller you could use race as a basis for creating a section 2 required district of the Voting Rights Act, a reasonably compact one."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,848.167,848.596,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.352,879.878,"But Mr. Aguilar, in answer to Justice O'Connor you said that they could have... perhaps I misunderstood your answer, but I thought you said that they could have satisfied the minority majority district composition with a more compact... that they could have satisfied both incumbency and race."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,883.291,885.05,--I did not complete my answer.
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.717,915.07,"Mr. Aguilar, let me understand what you're saying about the incumbency justification."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,946.382,952.817,"If the question ignores the requirements of the Voting Rights Act, I would say there would be a problem, if that's your only goal, but that's--"
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.817,954.265,I don't--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,954.265,973.37,"--What I'm saying, we have... the Texas legislature has the obligation to satisfy Federal requirements, and the Voting Rights Act is a Federal requirement, but in doing so, the State legislature ought to have, under our federalism, the right to use the same districting objectives as it uses for all the districts."
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.37,979.885,"--But you say that's a valid objective even though race is the means of achieving that objective, is that your position?"
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,979.885,980.235,Well--
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.235,982.256,Or do you say that race was not used here?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,982.526,983.585,--Race was used.
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.579,990.11,--So your question--
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,990.11,990.781,--pursuant to the Voting Rights Act.
1995.94-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.781,993.662,"--But your answer to my question must be yes, then."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1001.887,1004.268,"Well, I didn't finish the four different aspects of incumbency."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1013.645,1014.706,"Well, let me ask you this."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1030.898,1031.637,"--Well, it's--"
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.637,1041.454,"Can the legislature then say, fine, we're concerned about you, Mr. Incumbent, and so we'll exclude all blacks from your district."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1043.273,1049.258,"--Well, no, Your Honor, not in the hypothetical that you just posed to me, but that was not what we did here, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1051.409,1053.431,"Well, you may have... it may have been done in reverse."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1053.431,1063.468,"--Well, in fact, many blacks that could have been in a more compact jurisdiction, or a more compact district, in fact didn't go into the majority minority district."
1995.94-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.833,1075.204,"May I ask, is this what you're saying in substance, that incumbency protection had nothing to do with the number of majority minority districts."
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1082.149,1083.121,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.792,1100.233,Were they challenged?
1995.94-805,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1103.605,1107.158,"--They were challenged, Your Honor, but the court held there was no racial gerrymandering."
1995.94-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.039,1127.24,"Thank you, Mr. Aguilar."
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1129.071,1137.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1189.531,1213.377,"Do you agree with Mr. Aguilar that that is basically a confusion of categories, that narrow tailoring goes basically to number of districts, and the niceness of the lines with which they are drawn is essentially the question, or is essentially an issue that you look at when you're deciding whether, in fact, the motive was predominantly racial as distinct from a motive consistent with customary districting practices?"
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1213.377,1217.518,I think the niceness of the lines is relevant probably to both aspects of it.
1995.94-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.112,1246.967,"Well, I suppose if you... there's a point at which the line is crossed between protecting an incumbent who draws votes predominantly from one race, on the one hand, and packing on the other hand, but that is an inquiry, I take it, that you would make at the point where you're saying, what is the predominant motive here in order to determine whether strict scrutiny applies at all?"
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1247.778,1258.114,"Well, I think it's fair to say, but I think a State could have a compelling interest to create a majority minority district and then put many more minorities in that district than were necessary."
1995.94-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1258.114,1259.096,That would be packing.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1259.096,1262.659,"That would be packing, and that would be a violation of the narrow tailoring test."
1995.94-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1262.659,1264.121,But not the shape of the district.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1264.121,1267.092,The shape of the district might be a violation of the narrow tailoring.
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.092,1267.141,Yes.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1276.647,1276.977,"Right, and--"
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.977,1281.03,One of which would be compactness and contiguity.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1281.03,1283.662,--And another would be incumbency protection.
1995.94-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1283.662,1283.862,Yes.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1313.554,1326.093,"Right, and so here, the fact that the State could have drawn three compact districts, two in Houston and one in Dallas... it could have drawn a compact district in Dallas to provide black minorities there with an opportunity to participate fairly in the process."
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.83,1357.004,"Mr. Bender, is your answer the same... well, let me ask this first."
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1385.192,1389.104,"I wouldn't say that they were necessarily tied for first, but they are certainly--"
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.104,1390.744,They're up there... yes.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1390.744,1391.976,"--among the most irregular districts in the country, yes."
1995.94-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.579,1414.313,"Well, it's no different than in any other State, is it?"
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1424.077,1426.939,--I think... but the strength of it must vary from place to place.
1995.94-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.939,1435.715,But do you think that that overrides the need to avoid deciding boundaries on purely racial grounds?
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1438.186,1438.937,"No, it doesn't override the need."
1995.94-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1457.96,1467.435,Or does the State have to follow the constitutional requirement not to draw lines on primarily a racial basis?
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1467.435,1470.297,"That's not a constitutional requirement, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1508.411,1511.015,"Well, and there are also degrees of incumbent interest."
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1534.971,1536.26,That would require strict scrutiny.
1995.94-805,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1550.649,1557.154,"If we disagreed with that characterization of what happened, would we have to find that there was an illegality that occurred here?"
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1557.154,1563.99,"I think if you found that their motivation was to get black voters just because they're black voters, that would be unconstitutional."
1995.94-805,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.99,1567.092,But it's all right to get black voters just to protect incumbents.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1567.092,1569.282,It's all right to get Democratic voters.
1995.94-805,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1569.282,1571.293,That's not my question.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1571.293,1580.009,"And if in getting Democratic voters one of the ways they try to determine whether voters are likely to be Democratic or not was to look at their race, I don't think--"
1995.94-805,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1580.009,1581.26,So race can be used as a surrogate.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1581.26,1585.872,"--In that sense the motive is a nonracial one, namely to protect incumbency."
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.872,1590.497,"Do you know of any other area where we allow this, where we allow race to be used as a surrogate for some other desirable policy?"
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1597.94,1606.265,"I think in this situation, if the political reality is that if you're looking for incumbent--"
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.265,1606.616,I'm not asking about this situation.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1612.07,1614.453,--I can't think of one off hand.
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.453,1614.731,"I can't, either."
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1614.731,1615.583,But I think that--
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.583,1621.636,"But if race is, in fact, as you suggest, a real surrogate, then you don't have to use race."
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1621.636,1624.007,"--Well, I don't think--"
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.007,1625.278,You just look for Democrats.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1625.278,1637.057,"--I think you look for Democrats, and there are a lot of things you look for when you're looking for Democrats, and I think one of the things you... if all they did was say, we want Democrats, therefore we want black voters, Justice Scalia, I agree with you that would be unconstitutional."
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.93,1642.14,This was a more thoughtful racism?
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1644.223,1645.091,"--No, this wasn't done... no."
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.091,1645.502,We wanted Democrats.
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1648.945,1654.938,I think they used it as one of a number of factors in deciding who would be Democratic voters to put in that district.
1995.94-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.938,1657.37,--Didn't they have actual computer printouts of how people had voted?
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1657.37,1657.771,Yes.
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.771,1661.853,And so was there any need at all to consider their race if they wanted Democrats?
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1667.477,1667.815,Right.
1995.94-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.815,1674.27,Is there anything in the record that suggests that they went beyond looking at the precinct lists to see that they were Democrats when they did this--
1995.94-805,1,37685,paul_bender,,1674.27,1674.591,No.
1995.94-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.141,1690.972,"--Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1692.894,1700.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-805,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.704,1770.755,Ms. Hair--
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1806.717,1817.966,"Your Honor, I would say that race was used to decide whether a majority minority district can be created, and again I'll use Dallas as the example."
1995.94-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.479,1891.814,"Well, I doubt that we ever assume that in any case there would ever be a situation in which nothing but race is considered."
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1895.474,1895.915,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1932.068,1935.632,May I go back to an earlier statement that you made on that point?
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1943.907,1944.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.818,1946.098,Did it put it neatly somewhere?
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1946.098,1951.681,"Your Honor, on page 65a of the jurisdictional statement appendix--"
1995.94-805,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1951.681,1951.882,Okay.
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1951.882,1971.686,"--The court said that incumbency protection is part of the racial gerrymander, and the court did that because it confused the fact that some African Americans were taken out of the area that normally would have been the most compact version of District 30 in Dallas, for example, but a lot more whites were taken out, and that was error."
1995.94-805,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.686,1975.757,"May I ask you a question about your... may I finish my question, please?"
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,1996.343,1998.566,"Your Honor, it would not be, and let me tell you why."
1995.94-805,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.08,2009.443,"No, I'm not... really didn't... I want... what I'm really asking is, what is your interpretation of what the district court would do with those facts?"
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,2009.443,2013.948,"Oh, if a minority opportunity district were compact?"
1995.94-805,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.948,2014.385,Yes.
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,2014.385,2016.688,"I think the district court would uphold it, but the problem--"
1995.94-805,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.688,2020.349,"So what is at issue is not the number of minority majority districts, but their shape."
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,2020.349,2050.079,"--But how they look, and I want to make the point that that is very important, because my clients who live in these districts need to be able to bargain and compromise in the political process just like all other communities of interest across the State, and to single out minority opportunity districts and say that they have to have a special Federal rule of compactness that does not apply to majority white districts or any other districts in Texas we believe disadvantages them in the process."
1995.94-805,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.079,2065.949,"Well, do you suppose the same rule applies in reverse, that it would not be constitutional for the legislature to protect a white incumbent in a majority white district by fencing out all black voters?"
1995.94-805,2,37965,penda_d_hair,,2065.949,2072.504,"I think, Your Honor, that would not be constitutional, and that would be race as predominant, but that's not what happened here."

1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.993,2324.838,"Why did anyone care from a racial point of view, the interest being to elect a minority Congressman or woman?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2341.01,2360.091,"Your Honor, what the district court found was that they pursued a maximization policy basically constructing these majority minority single... actually single race majority districts essentially for their own sake, and then race was used as a tool for partisan advantage."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.932,2362.603,"Sorry, I don't understand."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2387.109,2388.06,--Well--
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.06,2389.781,--in seeing that it's an odd shape?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2402.209,2402.931,"--First of all, Your Honor--"
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.931,2409.315,"Unless, of course, you think a lot of black people happen to be Democrats, but you have the voting record, and so you can look at the voting records and not worry about race."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2409.315,2416.798,"--First of all, in Harris County what they did was, they were separating the races, Hispanics and blacks, because the communities were demanding their own districts for their own sake."

I'm not saying this is this case, but if it were proved beyond any doubt that the only reason that the districts were not compact in shape was to protect incumbents, and that that had nothing to do with race, under those circumstances would these... would such districts be constitutional, even under Miller?"

1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2521.057,2522.257,--I think--
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2522.257,2523.789,Would that be unconstitutional?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2523.789,2536.018,"--I think, Your Honor, that that is, in essence, a hypothetical that would not really arise in part because by definition, if you're taking into account compactness, contiguity, traditional political subdivisions, you are... race is not the predominant motivation."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2539.45,2541.24,Why isn't it the predominant motivation?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2545.324,2561.773,"If you're creating a compact majority minority district, then you are necessarily taking into account other factors, i.e., compactness, contiguity, traditional subdivisions, and the fact that you've got a naturally occurring community of people."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2561.773,2574.492,"So what you're saying is, it's okay to do it for racial purposes, and I... and you and I are both assuming that the racial purpose is justified by the Voting Rights Act, I take it, or at least by the... by correcting the Fourteenth Amendment violation."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2581.126,2589.041,I would say that it is... it is permissible to take race into account in districting so long as it is not the predominant factor.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.732,2614.378,"But what... aren't you assuming that what determines whether it's the predominant factor or not, what determines whether that factor is treated as predominant for purposes of Miller and Shaw, is a function of whether it is created consistently with districting practices as traditionally understood, and if the answer is yes, then it's not predominant, race is not predominant for Miller purposes."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2618.882,2632.202,"I think if you create it consistent with... with, again, looking for naturally occurring communities, so it is clear that what you're not trying to do is achieve a certain racial goal, and that's not your primary... that's not your predominant--"
1995.94-805,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2632.202,2632.411,It is.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2659.959,2672.689,"--I think that's... that, if... again, I think if someone swears on a stack of Bibles the only reason I tried to do this was race, and that was... then under Miller it would be subject to strict scrutiny."

1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2704.498,2705.089,I think--
1995.94-805,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2705.089,2706.058,--is that okay?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2706.058,2711.674,"--If race is the driving factor, it seems to me that under Miller, then it's subject to strict scrutiny."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2711.674,2728.915,"Then I don't see why you're not changing the Miller definition, because the Miller definition of what was predominant was a definition that considered whether the racial motivation subordinated the application of traditional districting principles, and it seems to me that your definition is rejecting the Miller definition."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2728.915,2732.117,I don't--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2732.117,2750.828,"In other words, we all recognize that sometimes... that race is going to be used, and sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's bad, and we've got to have some way to figure out, as a threshold matter, which it is, and Miller says it's predominant, and it's going to trigger strict scrutiny, if it subordinates traditional districting practices."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2750.828,2751.269,--Well--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2751.269,2753.229,Isn't that... do you understand Miller to hold that?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2753.229,2753.519,--Yes.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2753.519,2753.96,All right.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2754.49,2756.071,And I think that's... it's... sorry.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2756.071,2757.674,--let me ask you the next question.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2786.471,2787.733,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2788.023,2789.944,Then where did I go wrong?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2789.944,2791.316,--It seems to me that--
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.316,2800.181,"Perhaps in assuming that it's okay to do incumbent protection not by deciding who are Democrats, but by deciding who are blacks."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2800.181,2802.732,--I totally agree with that.
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.732,2803.003,That is not--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2807.264,2807.725,I think that--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.725,2808.606,Is that your answer?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2808.606,2810.086,--I think whatever label you--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.296,2810.877,"No, I want to know."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2811.288,2811.838,"Yes, that is--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2811.838,2812.798,--That was a good answer.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2814.17,2815.64,--That is my answer.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2815.64,2817.442,"Now, let me ask you a good question."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2847.031,2847.562,Your Honor--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.562,2849.272,Yes or no.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2849.272,2849.633,--Miller explicitly--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2849.633,2850.064,Yes or no.

1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2851.143,2853.096,Wrong or not wrong?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2853.096,2854.786,--If it so happens--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2854.786,2871.286,"If the lines are drawn because you're getting in Democrats, the fact that the Democrats happen to be black is not going to disqualify that as an application of districting practices, and it won't result in a conclusion that the racial motive was... that the motive was predominantly racial within Miller."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2871.967,2889.318,"--If it... if there is a confluence and a coincidence, and race was not the reason why, race was not the tool for finding out who are Democrats, then certainly, if it just so happens that the district is more black than not and more Democratic than not, that's okay, but--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.318,2914.917,"All right, then why shouldn't we then send this case back and say to the district court, tell us exactly, based on the evidence, whether, in fact, the discriminations that were made here were made based on political data which happened to disclose a racial composition, or whether it was made on data which was purely racial, and used merely as an unthinking surrogate for a political determination."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2920.159,2922.109,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think they have made that determination."
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2936.559,2951.579,"In this case, is the evidence that the computer program design used to draw the lines such that race became a surrogate for whatever was desired in the incumbency protection?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2951.579,2953.943,"I think the record does show that, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.987,2964.978,"I thought that page 65a, which we just read before, said that."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2974.195,2975.845,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2975.845,2977.517,"Now, the State didn't have to do that."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,2995.129,2996.469,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3004.272,3019.473,"Didn't it say on the... there must have been a computer printout, and it must have shown, let's say block by block, who the voters are, and didn't it have in that computer printout, or whatever they were looking at, the registration of a voter?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3019.473,3020.535,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.535,3021.156,It didn't?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3021.156,3022.084,It did not.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.484,3035.365,At the block level... at the level of each block they had--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3035.365,3038.437,"--At the level of each block, of each census block they had racial data, and racial data only."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.437,3038.717,--And--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3038.717,3041.699,And that was the primary tool that was used for dividing up these districts.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.699,3043.769,--But what's the smallest level that they had political party affiliation.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3043.769,3046.801,"The precinct level, and they could only bring up--"
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.801,3047.823,Precinct level.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3047.823,3053.826,"--On this computer they could only bring up a single election, and the district court found that that is really not what they used."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.829,3086.408,"All right, so in your view, if the legislature was trying to create a district to comply with Voting Right Act section 2, and in doing that they used race, and I don't know how else they would do it, that would be constitutional."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3099.004,3100.857,That is not... that is exactly xx what happened here.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.857,3101.318,But are the two principles right?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3103.158,3104.538,"The two principles are right, but that is by no means what happened here."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.969,3107.472,"All right, the two principles are correct, and then we'd have to argue about what happens here."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3107.472,3108.362,"--In Harris County, they were--"
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.362,3110.322,"But that is correct, isn't it, that's your view?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3110.322,3120.34,"--If there's absolutely no link between the shape and the racial demographics, then... then race was not the motivating factor."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.34,3123.011,But a mere correlation is not the kind of link that you're condemning.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3123.011,3125.421,Your Honor--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.421,3159.456,"I mean, if this case... let's assume that this judgment stands, and they have the same objective, and for the sake of incumbency protection this time they use whatever data they've got, let's say precinct level data, so that the lines are not going to be quite so fine but you still get a funny looking shape for purposes of incumbency protection, and your incumbency protection data is entirely political Democratic data or Republican data as opposed to race, and it ends up looking something like this, there will still be a factual correlation."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3168.652,3198.091,"--If the State accomplished its asserted goal of partisan gerrymandering through the use of nonracial data, then that is permissible, but... but, here they used racial data to accomplish that goal, and that is we think completely forclosed by... for example, if, in Gomillion, someone had said, well, we didn't fence out the blacks in order to... in order merely for discriminatory reasons, we fenced out the blacks because we wanted to be sure that we could be reelected because we know blacks won't vote for us, that is completely impermissible."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3198.091,3198.362,Okay.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3198.362,3211.879,"Similarly, in... this Court has never permitted a township to say, well, we want to maintain property values, and the best way that we could do that is by using... is by using something that is discriminatory in purpose, but our real goal... our real goal is to preserve--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3211.879,3213.021,"Right, it's going to be bona fide, sure."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3213.021,3213.719,--Okay.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3214.26,3216.571,May I ask you a different... I guess the next step question.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3295.877,3298.718,"--I think if you have two compact, contiguous, naturally occurring--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.718,3302.61,"No, it's not compact in the sense that the lines are nice."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3318.94,3326.915,"--No, Your Honor, I think it would be impermissible for a State to go block by block dividing up an integrated Polish or Jewish community."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3326.915,3327.175,Okay.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3328.617,3331.049,I don't think so.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3333.34,3333.901,So it's one rule for everybody.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3336.042,3336.252,--Absolutely.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.435,3339.915,"--Yes, but--"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3339.915,3340.416,If you're going--
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3340.416,3356.485,"--if they're just interested... I mean, a Democratic legislator or city councilman who wants to be reelected I take it is interested only in one thing, people who will vote for him, and he doesn't care what their color."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3380.15,3391.587,"--I think if at a certain point the predominant goal is the separation of races or religions or ethnicities, if that is the tool that is used to accomplish incumbency protection, then that is constitutionally--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3391.587,3394.08,"Yes, but Justice Breyer's example is different from mine."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3408.64,3415.444,"--Well, I think I gave the answer on... the motivation... the motivation does not matter if the means is race or ethnicity."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3424.339,3430.823,But in his example the people... St. Mary's gets in not because they're Catholics but because they're Democrats.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3430.823,3433.515,"--Well, that's in essence--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3433.515,3434.046,He knows that.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3434.046,3434.557,--a question of fact--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3434.557,3434.967,He knows that.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3434.967,3439.789,--for the district court as to whether or not the predominant motivation was whether they were Democrats or whether they were blacks.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3439.789,3447.674,"So if, in fact, the Court says they only wanted the St. Mary's Parish in there because they were Democrats, no problem on your theory."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3447.674,3450.257,"Again, it's a question of fact as to what--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3450.257,3456.73,"Yes, but I mean, if that's what the fact finding is, that's not... that is not suspect on your theory, right?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3456.73,3458.362,--It is not suspect to get Democrats.
1995.94-805,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3473.783,3477.935,"But Mr. Troy, this is the part of your argument that I have great difficulty grasping."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3526.447,3527.706,"Well, Your Honor--"
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3527.706,3529.209,"Counsel, did you concede that--"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3529.209,3530.799,--I don't really think I conceded that.
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3530.799,3533.661,--or did you say it would require strict scrutiny if that were the case?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3537.134,3537.885,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3538.646,3540.986,Have you made some other response to Justice Ginsburg that I missed?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3540.986,3541.948,"No, I don't think I did."
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3542.867,3550.522,"No, I thought you said in the hypothetical that it would be compactness and other factors that would be in addition to race, and that's why you say that--"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3550.522,3554.053,"--Your Honor, I think if you start out and race is your only goal, then maybe the Voting Rights Act--"
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.053,3561.749,"--You said if the district were compact, the fact that they might have been motivated by an interest in getting two or three majority minority districts would not have invalidated the plan."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3563.11,3563.951,--Let me explain.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.951,3564.472,I thought that's--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3576.71,3578.44,I don't think so.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.44,3578.791,Okay.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3578.791,3579.922,"And if I did, perhaps I misspoke."
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3579.922,3580.623,"You did, then."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3580.623,3581.423,"Okay, I misspoke."
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3590.288,3590.618,So that in--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3629.063,3629.834,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3629.834,3630.225,It isn't.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3631.504,3632.405,I think the Voting Rights Act prohibits--
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3632.405,3639.562,"--Why are they worried about creating minority... majority minority districts in order to comply with the act, then?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3639.562,3648.207,--I think the Department of Justice's maximization policy was hanging like a Sword of Damocles over this entire process.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3677.934,3678.435,"All right, but why, then--"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3682.038,3686.552,It seems to me if the Voting Rights Act requires you to draw these districts--
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3686.552,3689.334,"I'm just asking you, if they were compact, would that make any difference?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3689.334,3691.725,--If the Voting Rights Act required you to draw--
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3691.725,3692.235,"No, no, no."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3717.19,3721.324,--I don't think I follow your second question.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3721.324,3722.145,Well--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3722.145,3722.643,Sorry.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3722.643,3724.546,--What is the remedy that the district court is requiring?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3725.786,3726.547,They have to redraw the districts.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3726.547,3733.032,"In redrawing them, can they continue to have the same number of majority minority districts but differently shaped?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3733.032,3749.732,"Your Honor, we do not think that under the Voting Rights Act they can create single race majority districts here because the communities in question do not live in a sufficiently geographically compact area to require drawing of single race majority districts, and that is what they tried to do here."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3753.405,3756.166,Can you answer the first question that Justice Stevens asked?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3756.166,3756.236,I'm sorry.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3756.236,3782.545,"And the reason... the reason is, at least I break this question into two parts, or maybe three, and to get to an answer I have to have your opinion on just his first question, which was, if these were compact, and drawn to comply with section 2, and race was used... of course, section 2 is about race... wouldn't that be a compelling interest?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3788.707,3789.108,"Oh, yes."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3789.108,3789.528,Yes.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3789.528,3791.161,We believe that if section 2--
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3791.161,3791.709,All right.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3792.35,3792.831,--Absolutely.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3792.831,3793.882,--which is what I thought at the beginning--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3793.882,3794.932,If section 2 required these districts to be--
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3794.932,3795.292,--All right.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3795.292,3795.613,--Yes.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3795.613,3799.536,So if they're drawing them now in order to comply with section 2--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3810.222,3813.594,"That is true, the Court has never held that, but--"
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3813.594,3814.906,May I ask you an alternative--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3817.118,3844.556,"--We believe that in trying to have the State avoid the horns of a dilemma, a dilemma which, by the way, we think they falsely posit because they overinterpret the Voting Rights Act in far too broad a way, but we think that if you interpret the Voting Rights Act in a constitutional way to say that it simply prohibits discriminatory packing and cracking, then avoiding discriminatory packing and cracking can be a compelling governmental interest."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3862.528,3864.858,"All right, may I go back to the Miller definition."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3912.858,3913.719,It--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3913.719,3933.892,"If that is... if those three facts are what we know, is it fair to say under the Miller definition of what is a subordination of districting to race, that we would not have an apparent case of subordinated districting to race?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3940.497,3944.81,--If you start out and your goal is to create... it seems to me that you can't really have it both ways.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3956.769,3969.876,"Then what happens if... let's assume... all right, if I take that example, then it seems to me I am varying Miller, because Miller didn't say that any use of race, whether for compliance of section 2 or any other, is wrong."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,3986.666,4003.96,"--I think, Your Honor, that if you set out to create a racial goal, and your goal is to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and that is a remedial statute, and your purpose in complying with it is remedial, then it seems to me that your overwhelming purpose, because we're talking about the use of race here, must be remedial, and that--"
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4003.96,4004.439,All right--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4023.862,4024.603,--That--
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4024.603,4026.383,So that's your starting point.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4026.383,4027.655,"--I think that's right, that is your starting point."
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4027.655,4029.716,"All right, but that's not what Miller says, is it?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4053.562,4054.761,If you start out with--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4054.761,4055.703,I think that's what you're saying.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4055.703,4056.043,--Yes.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4056.043,4056.494,Okay.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4056.494,4057.315,If you start out with the goal--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4057.315,4057.684,So isn't it--
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4057.684,4065.749,"--of accomplishing race, and you use race as... at all times to make sure... abandoning compactness, abandoning requirements of the Voting Rights Act--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4065.749,4068.201,"--No, no, no, let's assume you don't abandon them."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4083.111,4085.062,--Strict scrutiny.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4085.062,4088.665,"So I think... is it fair to say, then--"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4088.665,4089.316,If race was the predominant factor in drawing--
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4089.316,4089.766,"--Oh, I grant you that."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4089.766,4090.456,--strict scrutiny.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4090.456,4103.113,"Is it fair to say, then, that you are in fact asking us to recognize a cause of action which is broader than Miller recognized, because otherwise that language in Miller did not mean what it said."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4105.865,4111.438,"I think, Your Honor, if race is the predominant motivation, and you look--"
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4111.438,4112.419,"No, but that's the question."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4112.419,4112.7,--Right.
1995.94-805,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4112.7,4121.165,"Miller says, in deciding whether it is predominant or not, you look to whether it has excluded the application of traditional districting principles."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4139.929,4144.52,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because Miller talks about the indirect and the direct evidence, and in this case--"
1995.94-805,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4144.52,4145.83,"Well, I guess you don't have that here, do you?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4157.648,4158.97,"--That is certainly true, Your Honor."
1995.94-805,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4177.483,4181.424,The three judges of the district court were all Texas judges here?
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4181.424,4182.024,They were all Texas judges.
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4182.024,4195.786,"The thing I wonder about the particular finding on page 65a is, I've got the point that if these were compact maybe you apply strict scrutiny, that section 2 perhaps we'd agree would justify it."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4232.658,4233.369,If I--
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4233.369,4253.962,"--and wouldn't that be key as to why they were fenced out, just as you've said you might have Jews in a district knowing that they're Jews and likely to vote Democrat, and you say okay, that's all right, if the reason is that they're likely to vote Democrat, and isn't this silent as to what the reason that the African American voters were or were not fenced out?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4253.962,4262.077,"--Your Honor, in this case the African American and the Hispanic communities in Harris County were simply pulled apart for their own sake."
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4270.532,4275.498,"Mr. Troy, I didn't understand you to say what Justice Breyer just said."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4284.992,4286.233,"In fact, I did not say that."
1995.94-805,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4287.185,4287.803,I thought you said just the opposite.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4287.803,4288.474,"--In fact, I did."
1995.94-805,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4294.699,4324.98,"So then that means you do favor, or somebody could bring a lawsuit in any kind of city council election, any of the thousands of elections in the United States and try to show that what the council had in mind was, it... all it knew was, this is an Irish neighborhood, this is a Catholic neighborhood, this is a some other neighborhood, and we're only interested in whether they vote Democrat or Republican, but if you could show that's in the councilman's mind at the time and he's making that inference, all this would become unconstitutional, thrown into the Federal courts, et cetera."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4324.98,4330.402,"The reason why I don't think that's going to happen, Your Honor, is because of compactness, contiguity, respect for political subdivision."
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4431.049,4432.979,I have one if you do have a minute left.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4459.385,4460.116,--I'm sorry.
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4460.116,4469.463,"Would that be a permissible reason to redraw and get unattractive districts in order to protect the number of Democrats, as opposed to the number of incumbents?"
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4469.463,4477.097,"I'm not quite sure I caught your first hypothetical, and my time is up, but I'd be happy if the Chief Justice will permit me to--"
1995.94-805,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4477.097,4477.948,Just go ahead and answer.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4477.948,4480.05,--The first part--
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4480.05,4498.903,"The hypothetical is that you start with compact districts that you would say would barely pass muster, even though race was an important factor in picking them up, but you get into noncompactness and gerrymandering in districts like this not to protect incumbents as such, but to make sure that the Republicans, who do not control the legislature, won't get too many seats."
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4498.903,4502.896,"--I think if your motivations are political, then your motivations are political."
1995.94-805,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4506.266,4509.278,The question is whether a political motivation would be a justification.
1995.94-805,3,21623,daniel_e_troy,,4509.278,4511.271,--Political... for noncompactness?
