2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.309,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-9877, Jon Cutter v. Reginald Wilkinson."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,54.142,57.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.041,97.604,"But, you know, when you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens imposed by the Federal Government."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,101.721,113.87,"That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that... that that doesn't make any substantial difference, in part, I think because if you think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's Spending Clause legislation."
2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.229,184.65,"But in... in the City of Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in and simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make it read differently than we had?"
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,184.65,190.793,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of Boerne."
2004.03-9877,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.396,227.182,"Well, RFRA didn't involve a... a limitation to situations in which Federal funds were involved, and as I understand this statute does."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,227.182,228.338,That is also true.
2004.03-9877,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.273,230.603,More than also.
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,233.706,236.275,"--Well, I take your point, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-9877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.73,256.956,Is that... what you're saying is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal spending hook.
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,267.313,277.712,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't make any constitutional difference."
2004.03-9877,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.87,292.778,"But, Mr. Clement, it seems to me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction, if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,301.066,307.476,"Well, Justice Stevens, I don't think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder or easier from a Spending Clause perspective."
2004.03-9877,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.071,341.513,Do you... do you think the Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we... if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue in that case?
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,341.513,343.572,"No, I don't, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.796,380.465,"And yet, it... it provides an unusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison context to get religion."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,407.775,409.366,Justice O'Connor--
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.366,412.165,--Federal Government seems to be trying to provide those incentives.
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,413.157,418.415,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of reasons why that's so."
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.64,446.69,"Well, the... the language of the statute is pretty strong: unless the government demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative interest."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,450.503,461.97,"Well, it does, Justice O'Connor, but just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same standard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a general law banning marijuana use outside or... or peyote use outside--"
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.97,462.876,"Yes, I think it was."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,462.876,465.901,--peyote outside of prison would be justified even under that standard.
2004.03-9877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.786,537.786,What about garb that is said to be associated with the religion but also is used as a cue for gang membership?
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,545.241,568.536,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think... and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns about using prison... religious symbols or other religious items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the... that there have been cases where the courts, even applying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have deferred to the government officials."
2004.03-9877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.463,616.658,"What... what about a religion that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation I want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my race?"
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,616.658,628.684,"--I think in a case like that... I mean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson would suggest that... that the prison officials are in a difficult position there and I think they could not accede to that request."
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.252,679.004,Does it... does the statute require the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of the particular religion that's espoused?
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,690.891,695.818,"Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so than under the Free... the Free Exercise Clause itself."
2004.03-9877,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,704.25,707.374,"We don't have to decide it here, but it's looming."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,713.357,717.101,"That's right, Justice O'Connor, but that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well."
2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.566,735.72,Haven't we said in at least one of our cases that the government can't favor religion over irreligion?
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,735.72,754.637,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court has been clear in the context of legislative accommodations of religion in particular to make clear that that preference of religion over irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide legislative accommodations of religion without providing benefits for secular organizations as well."
2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.759,812.743,Is that before us on the questions presented?
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,812.743,823.659,"--Well, I think it is not in the questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment below."
2004.03-9877,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.383,904.319,"I don't... I don't understand, Mr. Clement, how your second point strengthens your first point."
2004.03-9877,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,930.191,932.505,"--No, of course not, Justice Scalia, and I must have misspoke."
2004.03-9877,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.643,976.083,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,978.301,991.33,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9877,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.01,1107.569,Is Satanism a non-mainstream religion?
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1107.569,1116.609,"With all due respect, Your Honor, I understand that there is some uncomfortable feeling about the nature of my clients' religion."
2004.03-9877,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.626,1141.596,What does this have to do with it?
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1142.967,1144.929,"Well, I--"
2004.03-9877,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.072,1146.449,Our Royal Navy?
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1149.324,1152.486,The answer is yes then.
2004.03-9877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.629,1170.112,To what extent?
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1190.244,1216.126,--I believe that there is... it... the statute is pretty clear that if there is a... if it's compelling or requiring the State of Ohio to engage in an unconstitutional activity... and that would be a segregation of the races... that there's a compelling justification... or a compelling governmental interest in not complying with the statute or saying that the statute does not apply under these circumstances.
2004.03-9877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1216.126,1223.175,How about racist literature but it's under the aegis of a religious organization?
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1234.718,1258.722,"To the extent that there is bona fide religious literature that is racist, there are... we believe that the Constitution permits Congress or any legislative body to accommodate religion in isolation from other religious right--"
2004.03-9877,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.722,1259.821,"Well, when you--"
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1259.821,1261.047,--fundamental rights.
2004.03-9877,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.047,1267.072,"--When you use the term bona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1273.617,1289.382,"I believe they... as a matter of course, prison officials have to determine whether there's a good faith request for religious accommodation or whether the person is trying to seek something under... as a ruse."
2004.03-9877,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.382,1293.728,"I take it we've done that in the conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger and Gillette."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1293.728,1294.458,That's correct.
2004.03-9877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.031,1347.843,"--Well, the content discrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who wants to get this for political or psychological reasons--"
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1347.843,1349.369,That's--
2004.03-9877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1349.369,1355.203,"--you would say, I'm not challenging the right of the... as a member of this religious sect."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1356.584,1377.052,"--Well, as I say, to the extent that that's right, if there were content discrimination along those lines and... and the Court said that there could not be... it was the Court's view that it could not be accommodated for religion only, then of course the... then there would be a compelling governmental interest in avoiding content discrimination."
2004.03-9877,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.004,1401.995,"Well, I... I take it underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is... is the concern that this accommodation is unequal because there are other First Amendment rights that are not given the... that are not given the same precedence."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1401.995,1405.862,"Well, first of all--"
2004.03-9877,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1405.862,1409.461,"That... that was at least an underlying concern of her question, and I think it's a legitimate concern."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1409.461,1417.006,"--Well, as... as I read Amos, Amos says that the accommodation of religion need not come--"
2004.03-9877,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.006,1425.678,"Well, but in Amos, the Court was just... the... the government was just saying that one of its own statutes could be accommodated."
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1426.621,1448.353,"--Well, it's not... I'm not sure that it's different for constitutional purposes, that if there is a differential accommodation which the Court concludes violates the First Amendment rights of someone else because there's content discrimination, I'm not... there is no reason to treat the source of the accommodation as dispositive."
2004.03-9877,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.645,1559.229,I'm... I'm sorry.
2004.03-9877,1,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1562.864,1581.348,"--Well, the argument is that when, for example, a religious accommodation forces... and... and... the third parties to chip in, as they had to do in Caldor, for example, private third parties, that that renders the accommodation unconstitutional."
2004.03-9877,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.499,1592.761,"Thank you, Mr. Goldberger."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1595.646,1602.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.219,1624.99,Let me ask you this... this question because it... it... I think it goes to the... the heart of what I think is the problem in this case.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1686.631,1693.361,"Well, I think you are, Your Honor, and if our brief came across that way, I... I think it overstates the line that we're asking this Court to draw."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.043,1721.531,All right.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1724.545,1731.499,"The line is violated here, Your Honor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that arise in the prison context."
2004.03-9877,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.499,1750.363,"Well, what the statute appears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-Employment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free Exercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of religion."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1755.216,1769.983,"But in... in prison's unique environment, Your Honor, where there are so many deprivations of liberty and then to say the one... one way you can get out from under the thumb of all these prison regulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give you a powerful weapon not again to--"
2004.03-9877,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.983,1780.601,"But... but before Employment Division v. Smith, wouldn't we have had the same question arise in the prison context, and we would have dealt with it under the then-standards."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1780.601,1794.712,"--But... but the Court has... has always articulated that the rules... well, in Turner and O'Lone, the Court articulated that the rules are different in prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison administration and the... and the problems of subjecting--"
2004.03-9877,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.712,1801.539,But had the Court ever said that the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the prison context?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1801.539,1803.437,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1817.9,1818.267,Okay.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1844.218,1846.404,"We're not asking for that bright line rule, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.858,1872.022,"Well, it... but... but that is not what the rule says."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1918.975,1921.678,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think we need to go that far."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1937.165,1937.777,You... you--
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1937.777,1938.352,--that might not slide--
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.352,1946.106,"--You mean specific accommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can wear a religious medal, you can have a tatoo?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1949.801,1960.755,"--Well, a narrow, targeted... I guess the point is, Your Honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation would be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus approach to accommodation."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1960.755,1963.411,"It... it would also be rather a discriminatory one, wouldn't it?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1983.085,1998.135,"No, Your Honor, I... I don't believe so because I think if, for instance, the legislature said, you... you shall, absent some compelling need, provide prisoners with a diet that meets their religious requirements, that would not discriminate among religions."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.761,2009.051,"A guy comes along in a different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got to... we got to wear medals."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2027.354,2037.264,"And, Your Honor, we believe that in prison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond the Free Exercise Clause, it raises special problems and special concerns that need to be dealt with--"
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.264,2037.999,Why can't they--
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2037.999,2038.654,--on a case by case basis.
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2038.654,2054.706,"--But why can't they be dealt with under the statute as it is written, saying that if you... if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison, determine that in fact you... you have a compelling State interest that cannot be served in any other way, you can say no?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2064.466,2078.487,"It's insufficient, Your Honor, because it doesn't change the underlying fact that the request itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the request is, the request itself gets treated differently and better merely because it's religion."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2079.206,2094.31,"Well, are you saying that... that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a... a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights, recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2094.31,2095.078,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2096.458,2098.154,Then it's got to single out religion.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2098.154,2116.379,"And... and as the Court noted in Amos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to single out religion, but that doesn't shield them from Establishment Clause scrutiny just because they take the form of being directed at religion and providing a benefit that's... that's labeled as an accommodation."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.925,2140.196,Sure it would.
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.196,2140.303,So maybe that's--
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2140.303,2144.281,"And if you did it under the statute, you would clearly have a reason for saying no."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.281,2150.446,"Mr. Cole, are you sure that this statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith... our pre-Smith law?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2173.595,2174.454,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.902,2177.461,Did our prior Smith cases go that far?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2178.697,2189.538,"--No, they did not, Your Honor, and I think that's an important as well, that once someone has an... a bona fide religion and... and prison officials can challenge whether this is in fact a religious set of beliefs."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.632,2202.424,--They don't even have to say my... my religion requires me not to eat this food.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2203.582,2205.602,"For religious reasons, I would prefer to do this."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.602,2206.774,--Yes.
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.774,2209.52,--What is your argument in response to Justice Souter?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2256.921,2261.176,"Well, Your Honor, I wish I could draw a brighter line rule than--"
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.176,2261.299,No.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2262.925,2263.921,--Your Honor--
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2263.921,2264.081,--generally.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2275.754,2281.134,--It's the magnitude by which Congress has enhanced the religious right.
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.079,2288.34,Fine.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2328.089,2354.318,"Well, our argument is pinned on this Court's decisions in Turner and O'Lone, which we see as establishing the baseline for what type... for what the Constitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison, and then we'll use that baseline and compare the standard imposed there to the standard Congress is seeking to impose through RLUIPA and compare the magnitude of the two, understanding, as this Court has said in Lemon, that lines of demarcation are difficult to perceive."
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.936,2370.396,"You're saying if Turner had come up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that Turner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow pre-Smith law in the prison."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2370.396,2373.853,"I... I believe so, Your Honor, given prison's unique environment."
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.853,2374.082,I understand--
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2374.082,2389.206,"I believe Turner and O'Lone are prison cases that talk about what the Constitution means in prison, understanding that in prison there need to be changes to what we would otherwise see as the inmates' constitutional rights if they were not in prison."
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.206,2392.268,"--Now, I... I understand the argument now, which has been helpful."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2415.327,2420.544,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the burdens in the prison environment are twofold."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.837,2441.018,I think... I think you may exaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State interest.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2463.961,2464.574,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.255,2484.828,"And that goes beyond pre-Smith too, doesn't it?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2486.32,2491.685,"The... the least restrictive alternative, which is what puts the teeth in RLUIPA and what's... what creates the problem--"
2004.03-9877,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2491.685,2497.71,We now have some experience in the Federal system where the same standards apply under RFRA.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2521.514,2525.396,"--Well, the United States claims no, Your Honor, of course."
2004.03-9877,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.508,2559.483,"Yes, but now that some of that has gotten sorted out through the experience of the Bureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect there would be less of those far-out claims."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2571.035,2588.598,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the difficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least restrictive alternative test is... is the possibility, as this Court noted in Turner, that every judgment every day is subject to some court somewhere finding that there was a less restrictive way of achieving the goal."
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.397,2590.0,This is true.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2629.767,2632.086,"--Well, that's not particularly encouraging, Your Honor, but--"
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.736,2636.405,"No, but... your point."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2636.405,2637.647,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2681.505,2683.942,Then why hasn't that been the effect on the Federal ground.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2683.942,2686.353,"--Your Honor, I... I don't know that it hasn't."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.687,2716.366,"I'll... I'll grant you that, but it seems to... I mean, Justice Ginsburg responded to that by saying that these things get sorted out."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2728.652,2736.652,"--Your Honor, I don't know that the fact that... that strict scrutiny might become... what that means, what that's going to require."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2763.156,2770.371,"Well, I don't know what that's got to... you know, you may or may not have an argument there, but I don't know what it's got to do with the meaning of the Establishment Clause."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2770.371,2771.513,"Well, Your Honor, the--"
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.513,2773.187,And they're not burdening you anyway... anyway.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2774.04,2775.07,--Well--
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.07,2775.954,It comes with the money.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2775.954,2776.456,--I'm--
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.456,2777.411,You don't want the burden?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2780.237,2783.164,"--I'm not sure I agree with that, Your Honor, for... for a couple of reasons."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.089,2793.622,What we have before us in this case is... is a case covered by the... the Spending Clause.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2796.539,2809.455,"--But... but secondly, Your Honor, with respect to the Spending Clause issue, this Court has said in Dole that there needs to be relatedness between the spending, that if there's going to be strings attached, they actually have to be attached to the Federal money in some meaningful way."
2004.03-9877,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.376,2820.554,But the Sixth Circuit didn't pass on the Spending... Spending Clause issue.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2820.554,2822.281,"--No, they did not, Your Honor, but we--"
2004.03-9877,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2822.281,2825.773,And it isn't raised by your opponent's petition.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2825.773,2832.851,"--That's... that's true, Your Honor, but it is available to the Court as an alternate ground of affirmance of... of the decision below."
2004.03-9877,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.851,2833.944,"Yes, if we're looking for that."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2833.944,2836.962,"Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-9877,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2836.962,2840.859,There was one question brought up about Ohio's own practice.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2867.638,2877.386,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because our theory isn't that anytime you go beyond what free exercise requires, you're immediately into an Establishment Clause violation."
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.173,2902.82,"May I ask this question, Mr. Cole?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2938.493,2944.311,"Your Honor, first, I'm not sure that their claim is that, oh, we're being treated differently and worse."
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.204,2962.439,Don't mainstream religion adherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in their cell?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2962.439,2971.26,"They... they may well, Your Honor, and... and the point is in each of those cases, prison officials look at the object and say what's the potential for harm here."
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.049,2981.392,"The mainstream person, if there's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep it in the... in the cell, would they?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2981.392,2982.992,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.992,2995.408,"And in other words, is it really... although the language in the statute seems to go farther, is there anything really at stake here beyond saying treat us the same as you treat mainstream... members of mainstream religions?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2995.408,2997.376,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.105,2999.203,And what is the best example of that?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2999.203,3006.626,There's a... a request for a prisoner who wants the grooming regulations changed with respect to him.
2004.03-9877,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3034.476,3035.857,If you want us to say that--
2004.03-9877,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.857,3038.524,It would seem to me that would be a compelling interest to say you can't do that.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3038.524,3042.267,"Your Honor, again, I'm... I'm sure there's a compelling interest."
2004.03-9877,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3061.405,3074.263,"--Well, I... I suppose you're saying you want us to make the holding that... one of the holdings you'd be satisfied with is that while some accommodation is... is appropriate, this is extreme accommodation."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3092.054,3096.56,"Frankly, Your Honor, other than RFRA, it's the only time Congress has gone this far."
2004.03-9877,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3103.732,3107.027,"Well, I guess what I'm asking is what's the closest analogy you can--"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3107.027,3119.747,--In our brief we... we looked at Lee v. Weisman in what the Court called subtle and indirect coercion to religion when it was merely standing for a... a invocation during graduation once a year.
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.557,3132.038,What about the American Indian who didn't... or was it... I think it was an American Indian.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3142.763,3144.047,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.047,3153.146,So that to me stood for the proposition that administrative considerations play an important role in deciding whether you've hit upon the least restrictive alternative.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3160.987,3166.618,"Again, Your Honor, it's not that we couldn't potentially win these cases under least restrictive alternative."
2004.03-9877,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.073,3199.23,--You're asking us--
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.23,3206.045,Why is it... why is it worse for... for judges to be overseers of religious life in prison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious life in prison?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3211.325,3212.172,"--Right, and it's--"
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.172,3214.246,And that someone is going to be a government official.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3225.642,3237.636,"--Except, Your Honor, this Court noted in Turner, I believe it was, that the need for judicial deference is particularly strong when you're dealing with situations that create ripple effects in prison."
2004.03-9877,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3248.835,3258.359,And I think that means that they will give great deference to what the... what the wardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of... of the penal system.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3258.359,3260.231,"If they will, it's not in the face of the statute, Your Honor."
2004.03-9877,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3266.374,3267.916,Can you... can you give me an example?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3284.827,3296.863,"--Well, I believe Mr. Clement noted that... that there was a case that held that, okay, you can't wear the medallion on the outside of your shirt, you can wear it on the inside of your shirt."
2004.03-9877,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3309.956,3314.963,"Well, maybe if the warden says that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to accommodate."
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3314.963,3325.63,"Maybe, Your Honor, but... but the question is, is it permissible for Congress to create incentives for prisoners to say, yes, I'm religious because I want these other benefits?"
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3345.256,3346.135,Better shot than... better shot than what?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3350.268,3350.971,Better shot than--
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3350.971,3357.732,"And aren't you arguing that in the prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise line, you are into establishment?"
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3357.732,3360.213,"--Well, and Your Honor, I was not careful there."
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3362.686,3362.888,Okay.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3367.928,3370.156,--I--
2004.03-9877,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3370.156,3372.672,It can... it can be better but not much better?
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3372.672,3374.591,--I think by comparing to what's gone before.
2004.03-9877,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.616,3387.282,It is.
2004.03-9877,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3388.291,3388.68,Thank you.

2004.03-9877,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3408.465,3416.86,Why don't you address the ways in which this act goes beyond our former free exercise--
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3416.86,3418.641,"I'd be happy to do that, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-9877,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.308,3451.963,Also not compelled... not compelled... by religion.
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3459.731,3460.376,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2004.03-9877,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3460.376,3461.196,It's not compelled.
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3471.69,3479.871,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think this Court has ever in its accommodations cases held that the government can only accommodate those things that are central."
2004.03-9877,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.587,3495.715,--the LDS.
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3495.715,3496.259,--What's that?
2004.03-9877,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.259,3499.447,I said you may underestimate the LDS.
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3500.312,3501.528,"I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-9877,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3528.486,3528.597,I guess you're right.
2004.03-9877,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3533.082,3538.638,"--Well, I... I think that's right, and I think there is not that centrality requirement for accommodations."
