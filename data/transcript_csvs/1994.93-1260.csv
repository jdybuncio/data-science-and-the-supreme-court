1994.93-1260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1260, United States v. Alfonso Lopez, Jr.--"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,28.0,32.368,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.093,142.923,"Well, if we were concerned that the original understandings and structural theories that underlay the Federal system have been so eroded that that whole system is in danger, I take it that it would be appropriate for us to consider some procedural guarantees."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,142.923,174.744,"Yes, and this Court has considered and imposed certain procedural guarantees where, for example, it felt that Congress was legislating in a way that encroached upon the operations of State governments, as in the case of New York v. United States, where this Court held that Congress could not legislate to the extent it did to require that the States take title to certain nuclear waste."
1994.93-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.554,227.112,"Well, let's do exactly that, and ask whether the simple possession of something at or near a school is commerce at all."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,228.195,232.933,"I think the answer to that is that it is, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.933,239.003,"I would have thought that it wasn't, and I would have thought that it, moreover, is not interstate."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,239.003,241.039,Justice O'Connor--
1994.93-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.039,246.609,"If this is covered, what's left of enumerated powers?"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,253.346,274.676,"--Justice O'Connor, that certainly is a question that one might ask, but this Court has asked that question in a number of other circumstances, and rather than starting from the assumption that something was inherently local, it's looked at the degree to which Congress had a reasonable basis for extending its authority under the commerce power to regulate that particular activity."
1994.93-1260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.676,281.68,"But in some of those very cases, General Days, the statement is found that the power is not limitless."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,281.68,285.068,"Well, that is certainly the case, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1994.93-1260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.555,302.695,"Well, what would be... if this case is... Congress can reach under the interstate commerce power, what would be an example of a case which you couldn't reach?"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,302.695,319.789,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not prepared to speculate generally, but this Court has found that Congress, for example, in New York v. United States could not regulate... could not require New York State to carry out certain responsibilities, because it was commandeering the instrumentalities of the State."
1994.93-1260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.789,327.161,"Well, the objection there was that it was objecting the State governmental machinery to operate in a certain way."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,336.416,336.95,Yes.
1994.93-1260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.95,347.974,"Can you tell me, Mr. Days, has there been anything in our recent history in the last 20 years where it appears that Congress made a considered judgment that it could not reach a particular subject?"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,348.791,371.44,"I don't know whether there's been a conscious effort to do that, but I think as this Court has said in its Tenth Amendment jurisprudence that Congress reflects the will of the people, and it has built into it, and into its operations, a concern about the extent to which its regulations and its legislation would encroach on matters that have been traditionally left to the State."
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.44,382.029,"Mr. Days, we have really not been too... what should I say, too strict about, you know, what the farthest reach of the Commerce Clause may be."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,423.724,425.224,"Your Honor, two--"
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.224,431.212,"Might we not apply a different rule in that case than we do... I mean, give up the whole realm of commerce to the Federal Government."
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,437.116,438.149,"--Well, I have two--"
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.149,439.101,But it has to relate to commerce.
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,440.734,441.77,--I have two responses.
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.595,488.131,Noncommercial activities that affect commerce.
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,490.833,491.566,"--Well, it's not--"
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.566,493.368,Noncommercial activities that affect commerce.
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,493.368,520.686,"--If one looks, Justice Scalia, for example, at the regulation of firearms, certainly Congress was concerned about the degree to which transfer or possession in some instances affected interstate commerce, but I think it also recognized that having a gun in and of itself is not interstate commerce, it's the impact of certain activity on interstate commerce."
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.558,530.891,I understand--
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,530.891,531.91,--has to do with interstate commerce.
1994.93-1260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.91,533.01,--but have we ever held... I'm talking about cases of ours.
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,545.851,568.416,"I don't believe that the issue has been clearly presented, Justice Scalia, but I think that what this Court has operated upon as an initial assumption is that Congress was given the power under the Constitution to legislate directly upon private individuals, and that there are no built-in limitations on the Constitution."
1994.93-1260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.416,575.403,"--General Days, just to understand what we're talking about, do I correctly understand your position to be, your rationale for this--"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,575.403,575.939,Yes.
1994.93-1260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.939,589.413,"--that all violent crime, if Congress so desired, could be placed under a Federal wing, could be placed in the Federal court for prosecution, all violent crime, or is there any stopping point?"
1994.93-1260,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,593.734,601.138,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the answer is that it may be possible for Congress to do that under the commerce power."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1630.019,1639.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.134,1664.423,"I am aware of at least two schools within 1,000 feet of an interstate highway."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1673.829,1674.714,"Yes, sir."
1994.93-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.714,1687.939,"Well, if a State tried to pass this identical statute, would that not be, then, an interference with interstate commerce beyond the authority of the States to enact?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1687.939,1694.609,"It might very well be, if that act were, in fact interfering with interstate commerce."
1994.93-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1694.609,1705.15,"But if that is so, under the vacuum theory, then the Federal Government necessarily would have the power to enact this same law, lest there be a vacuum."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1705.15,1713.589,"The... let me back pedal, then, a little bit on my statement regarding preemption."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.493,1725.028,"Is that so, the States cannot prohibit crimes on interstate highways?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1732.801,1736.168,If the Court found... I believe if the Court found--
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.168,1737.018,This is extraordinary.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1737.018,1749.428,"--that the State law was burdening interstate commerce, which I don't believe it would find, but assuming that... I was assuming in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical that there would be a finding that it burdened--"
1994.93-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.428,1750.745,"That there would be an interference, yes."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1750.745,1759.149,"--interstate commerce and in that case, the case law I believe would... that's one of the dangers of preemption of State law by Commerce Clause legislation."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.149,1768.707,"But we would make such a finding of burdening interstate commerce presumably because we believe we have the capacity to figure out what is interstate commerce and, indeed, much beyond that, what burdens it, right?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1768.707,1769.873,That's correct.
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.873,1776.693,"But of course, the argument made here is that we don't have that capacity, because it's a political question."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1778.728,1784.716,"Well, that's an argument that seems to me to have been raised at argument today."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.434,1789.536,"It's an argument that was disclaimed, as I understood the Solicitor General."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1791.303,1794.238,"Yes, I believe that's correct, and--"
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.238,1795.357,"You disclaim it, too."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1795.357,1817.453,"--I'll disclaim it to a... large extent, yes, although I believe that Justice Kennedy's rationale for clear statement principles in Commerce Clause cases is a very good one, and illustrates why you can't simply have laws like the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which on its face appears to be a general police power statute."
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1824.793,1833.732,"Suppose it had the findings that have been subsequently added, would that be sufficient--"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1833.732,1834.365,--That--
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.365,1835.582,"--and if not, why not?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1835.582,1841.219,--That would call for a different analysis by this Court under its prior case law.
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.675,1851.611,"Well, what's your position?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1859.364,1863.834,Those particular findings are awfully global.
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.786,1869.922,"Could you answer the question, though?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1869.922,1871.005,--I would--
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.005,1873.124,"Valid or invalid, under your theory?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1873.124,1879.178,"--Under my theory, shooting from the hip today, I would question their validity."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.765,1895.806,"They just have to say more, but so long as they say enough, whether it's true or not, it's okay, is that it, and we would not inquire as to whether it's true or not."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1895.806,1902.543,"--Under this Court's precedent, if they say enough, then it triggers the deferential standard of review."
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.543,1911.899,"Even if it isn't interstate and isn't commercial, that's fine, just so long as they add a string of rationales here?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1911.899,1916.053,"One can make that argument from this Court's prior case law, yes."
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.053,1918.303,I just wanted to know what argument you were making.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1918.303,1944.101,"I... I'm trying to make an argument that comports the Court's prior case law, which, as a practitioner of law, I'm in a position... not in a very good position to question, with what happened here, and how very different this law is even from prior legislation which doesn't appear to regulate the concerns that you've identified but the Court has upheld."
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.607,1954.559,I would have thought that was commercial activity.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,1954.559,1958.344,I would... I would agree with you 100 percent on that.
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.979,2017.467,"But basically you have a client you're trying to keep out of jail, and as far as you're concerned it's enough to say they didn't make the findings and let us worry about the rest some other time."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2017.467,2019.335,That is my duty as his attorney.
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.335,2019.919,It is your duty.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2030.976,2031.626,Yes.
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.188,2052.473,What about a general ban on certain types of assault weapons?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2056.775,2057.043,Simple--
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.043,2058.393,--of certain types of weapons.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2058.393,2059.393,--types of assault weapons.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.988,2115.73,"It would be helpful to me if you'd answer the question... whether the explosive device or machine gun, just possession of one or the other within 1,000 feet of a school, could be prohibited by Congress."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2115.73,2119.2,"If, in an individual instance, it affected interstate commerce--"
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.2,2129.223,"Well, just the same... you've got exactly the same statute you have here, except you substitute for firearm the word, machine gun, or explosive device."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2129.223,2134.477,--Absent some finding by Congress linking it to its commerce power--
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.477,2135.51,It would be the same case.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2135.51,2136.912,--I believe it would stand on the same footing.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.912,2137.379,"Now, we have the findings."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2150.653,2154.457,Because the findings are made by a subsequent Congress.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.325,2167.015,"But do you think if they had, for example, made a regulation of railroad transportation and didn't make the finding that this involves interstate commerce we couldn't take judicial notice of that?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2167.015,2172.502,--This Court could take judicial notice of Congress' prior findings regarding the effect--
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.502,2176.471,"But why can't we take judicial notice of what they found today, or just a couple of weeks ago?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2176.471,2184.892,"--Because we're talking... we're not talking about something that happened today, we're talking about something that happened in 1992, before those findings were made."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.892,2191.713,"Yes, but it's the same statute, and either that does affect commerce or it doesn't, and I don't know why the findings make any difference."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.248,2196.284,"--We're making up this procedural requirement, anyway."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2206.473,2220.566,"That would retroactively convict Mr. Lopez under a different theory than he was prosecuted under, in that this Court has also considered findings--"
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.566,2237.527,"I don't think that's right, because he was prosecuted under a statute that was on the books, and the statute is either valid or invalid because it does or does not have an adequate connection with commerce, and I don't know that Congress, when Congress makes the findings has anything to do with that... with whether in fact it has a justifiable connection with commerce."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2237.527,2245.967,"--Well, Congress in 1990 could have linked gun possession in a school zone with commerce in another way besides findings."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.294,2298.566,Why isn't your answer that what Congress finds to have been true in 1994 is not necessarily what Congress would have found to have been true in 1990?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2298.566,2299.602,I think--
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.602,2302.054,Why isn't that an adequate answer to keep your client out of jail?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2302.054,2305.005,--I think in my own awkward way that's what I was trying to say.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.521,2306.538,Mr. Carter--
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2309.807,2310.357,They very well could have.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.357,2310.773,Which ones?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2321.447,2325.316,I don't... I would think... I don't see how they can be retroactively acceptable.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.316,2330.787,"I understand that argument, but that's not saying that the facts underlying the findings have changed in the last 2 years."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.488,2344.479,"A finding requirement is a finding requirement, isn't it, and if you insist upon a finding by Congress, surely that finding has to be a finding related to 1990, or, you know, whenever the even occurred--"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2344.479,2345.046,I would... I would--
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.046,2346.446,--and there is no finding relating to that date.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2346.446,2348.098,--I would agree 100 percent.
1994.93-1260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2359.389,2367.293,"All right, so what would you say about the obvious argument, the simple argument against your position that this isn't a borderline case?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2402.449,2407.97,My first reply to that is this act reaches more than guns in schools.
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2434.537,2447.78,"Does it make sense for us to say that the only flaw in this legislation is the one you're pushing, because it's so obviously easy to get up a set of findings."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2462.004,2465.325,I don't believe it would diminish the Constitution.
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.514,2478.983,We have no authority under the Constitution to prescribe procedures for Congress.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2510.704,2520.56,"--It... I wouldn't view it as... in quite the same sense as you do, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.966,2557.768,We cannot presume that that has happened?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2565.941,2598.578,"--In an area of noncommercial activity, and in a statute that reaches as broadly as this one, I think the presumption that Congress undertook all these steps which would be formalized with findings evaporates, because otherwise we're in a situation where, as Justice Souter quoted Benjamin Franklin, you can rationalize regulation of any human activity as affecting commerce."
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2598.578,2611.736,"Is that difference in certainty the reason why you draw a line, as I understand that you do, between this statute and a statute in which Congress, presumably without any findings, simply criminalized the discharge of handguns in a school?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2623.627,2623.927,No.
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.041,2655.932,"You mean, if Congress simply, without findings, said discharges are criminalized, there would be a patent rational relationship there to interstate commerce, whereas there is not here?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2655.932,2657.2,--No.
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2665.806,2673.71,"Then your answer... if I push you to the wall, is your answer going to be that the discharge statute would also be unconstitutional?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2673.71,2681.649,"--Without a... having an effect on commerce, yes, that--"
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2681.649,2682.116,Well--
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2682.116,2682.566,--I think--
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2682.566,2683.684,--assume two cases.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2686.47,2691.172,"--A discharge statute, simply outlawing all discharges--"
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2691.172,2692.957,"In... within 1,000 feet of a school."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2692.957,2695.409,--I would think that to be unconstitutional.
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.409,2695.676,All right.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2715.553,2718.255,That would be more rational than what we're facing here.
1994.93-1260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2718.589,2719.441,Is it rational enough?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2719.441,2720.741,--Not for me.
1994.93-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.741,2723.243,How about for us?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2723.243,2723.576,That's--
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.515,2736.467,"That would depend upon how rational we are, I suppose, and you don't want to press that."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.467,2747.424,"What about a statute that prohibits the conduct of school classes in rooms where there's a lot of asbestos in the wall or the ceiling, just prohibition."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2759.899,2765.57,"I would think that that, as stated by you, would be of very doubtful constitutionality."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.855,2781.514,"Let me go one step further and require them to remove asbestos wherever it is on the school premises, also remove all explosive devices at the same time."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2781.514,2796.607,"--I think, as stated by you, that would be of doubtful constitutionality where it would also--"
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.607,2797.957,I think under your theory it would be.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2797.957,2806.047,"--Yes, and I think it would raise questions under New York v. U.S. about ordering the schools, what Congress can and cannot order States to do."
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2806.047,2813.653,"You emphasize in the beginning that you are an advocate for a particular client, and so you're concentrating on the absence of findings."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2825.008,2826.16,I don't believe it did.
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2839.118,2846.207,"So if you're wrong about the necessity for findings, then what happens to this case?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2846.207,2847.49,--If I'm--
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.49,2858.182,"That's all that the Fifth Circuit decided, that findings are needed, and if we decide... follow the ordinary presumption that Congress had a reason for what it did--"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2858.182,2865.668,"--Then this Court must address the question of, if Congress had the power to do what it did under the Commerce Clause."
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.668,2871.255,"--Even though that would be taking a first view of that question, because it was not decided below."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2871.255,2887.367,"Well, the Court could direct it... remand it to the Cong... I mean, to the Fifth Circuit in light of the Court's decision here, of course."
1994.93-1260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2887.367,2891.403,Because we are ordinarily not a court of first view.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2891.403,2896.557,"That is correct, and that is an option open to this Court."
1994.93-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2896.557,2903.643,Could the Congress make it a crime to throw a fire bomb into a schoolhouse?
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.643,2925.057,"You know, if you're going to take the position that the Federal Government is a Government of limited powers, it means a limitation on doing good things, as well as limitations on doing bad things."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,2925.992,2926.609,I--
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.496,3012.779,What about simple possession of marijuana?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3012.779,3024.237,That's been justified under the commerce and the foreign commerce power and the problems of indistinguishability from--
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.237,3027.672,But your position is that would be permissible.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3027.672,3030.458,"--The courts have so held, yes."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.458,3039.396,"On the theory that marijuana is more apt to be moved in commerce... I mean, you can have locally grown marijuana, I suppose... or on the ground that it's more harmful than the guns?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3039.396,3044.383,"Well, there's findings made by Congress regarding marijuana."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3051.154,3060.845,"I'm assuming a State doesn't prohibit the mere possessio, but might the Federal Government nevertheless prohibit mere possession?"
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3060.845,3066.583,--If that were necessary to exercise Congress' commerce powers--
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.583,3068.283,It makes precisely the same findings.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3073.236,3078.473,--I think the prohibition on that basis would have to be limited to students.
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.473,3079.406,To students.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3079.406,3086.81,"Under that rationale, there'd be no rational relation between nonstudents and smoking marijuana and their effect."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.649,3100.719,"To distinguish that, we wouldn't want to get all of these drug possession cases out of the Federal courts."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3101.969,3129.172,"The Government's arguing that the Commerce Clause gives the Federal Government a general police power that it wasn't given by the Constitution, and this act doesn't regulate commerce, it doesn't regulate interstate activity, and because Congress may possess some powers to regulate guns around schools doesn't mean that it exercised its power in this case, in this act."
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.452,3159.608,--I suppose you could make... there's no doubt under our prior cases that you could make it unlawful to sell or traffic in marijuana.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3162.31,3163.527,I believe so.
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.527,3169.281,"And the only issue would be whether it's interstate or intrastate commerce, and we've been very liberal on that, once commerce is involved."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3169.281,3171.649,And that is the basis of a lot of regulation of firearms.
1994.93-1260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.649,3176.053,"Or trafficking in guns, or trafficking in machine guns and so forth, all of that would be easily covered."
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3176.053,3178.503,"Yes, and most of it is today."
1994.93-1260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3178.503,3181.255,Or possess with intent to distribute.
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3181.255,3188.277,"Correct, or to possess with intent to affect interstate commerce I believe may be regulable."
1994.93-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.277,3193.931,Or just possess with intent to use either a gun or marijuana would be beyond the Federal power?
1994.93-1260,1,29777,john_r_carter,,3193.931,3199.585,"The gun, I believe, yes."
1994.93-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3213.776,3215.262,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
1994.93-1260,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3217.464,3222.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions, I'd like to waive my rebuttal."
1994.93-1260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.265,3223.617,Very well.
