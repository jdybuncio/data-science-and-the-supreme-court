1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.449,We’ll hear arguments first this morning in United States against Clark.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,21.189,24.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.139,149.687,Mrs. Shapiro?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,149.687,149.866,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.866,156.705,"You say that though, haven’t they proposed the elimination of the “lived with” requirement?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,156.705,162.814,"There is a proposal that was passed by the House last week, a Bill."
1979.78-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,162.814,164.988,But doesn’t that come from the Commission?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,164.988,165.399,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,189.741,199.439,"Mrs. Shapiro, when you say that the Act is consistently been construed to require that the “lived with” requirement be met at the time of the death of the wage earner."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,213.705,218.278,I don’t believe there are significant numbers.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.485,223.825,I just don’t have any feel for how often this problem arises?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,223.825,227.849,It’s a consistent administrative interpretation.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,227.849,231.59,"But does that mean twice or a hundred times, would we know?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,231.59,234.263,As far as --
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.263,236.166,"Or once maybe just this case, wasn’t it?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,236.166,236.367,No.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,240.447,250.72,"I know normally they do things as of the date to death, but I’m just wondering how often it really a significant that the target --"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,250.72,255.533,"I’m not sure that it has been litigated before, but the --"
1979.78-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,255.533,269.138,"I think what bothers me is your use of the word “consistent” because if the Commission in now behind this proposed legislation, they’re receding from what may have been a consistent position, aren’t they?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,269.138,276.222,The legislation is based on the Court decisions.
1979.78-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.556,291.124,The Commission interpret the Act as passed by Congress or just make recommendations for changing?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,291.124,300.742,"Well, the Commission, it interprets it in an administrative act in paying benefits."
1979.78-1513,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.113,454.143,"Do I understand Mrs. Shapiro that the Clark children are now for the reasons you gave us, receiving benefits?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,454.143,462.882,They are receiving benefits under the decision of the Court of Claims.
1979.78-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,508.965,518.966,"Somewhere along the line, have you discussed the appellee’s suggestion that “lived with” may be applied to some period other than at the time of death?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,518.966,522.571,"Well, our argument on that really is fairly simple."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,560.987,568.042,"What if they never lived with the father, but he arranged for them to be somewhere else and paid for all their living?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,568.042,576.845,"Well then, they are not qualified under the statute because they were not living within in a regular parent-child relationship when he died or --"
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.845,582.559,So that the support factor vanishes under that language?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,582.559,602.209,"Well, the theory behind the statute is that for illegitimate children, the easiest and simplest and most accurate way of determining whether there was support is by simply looking to see whether they were living with the wage earner."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,602.209,613.247,"Well, on the contrary, if the man can show canceled checks over the period of 10 years, tax deduction every year for support, then that would be pretty good evidence, wouldn’t it?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,613.247,616.747,It would be an alternative way of proving that the --
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,616.747,618.211,The support factor?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,618.211,618.334,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,618.334,621.301,As distinguished from the “lived with” factor?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,621.301,635.692,"That’s right, but the congressional judgment was that as this current Court has frequently recognized, the classifications may be minimally inaccurate in some situations."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,644.413,655.232,"Theoretically, they could live with the father without receiving any support from whom with a grandmother paying the father for all their care?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,655.232,657.209,It certainly is theoretically possible.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.248,680.824,What about legitimate children?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,680.824,688.324,Legitimate children are deemed to have been supported whether or not they’re living with the wage earner.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.324,690.671,Or whether or not they are in fact supported?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,690.671,692.056,Right.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.88,706.925,What do you suggest the Congress is attempting to do to avoid that the problems of the proof in individual cases?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,706.925,710.676,They provided for a “lived with” requirement that isn’t --
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.676,711.278,Why?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,711.278,716.675,"Act, because it’s an accurate indicator of support in generality of the cases."
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.675,722.903,"In the generality, but, so the only advantage was to avoid individualizing cases?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,722.903,723.968,That’s right.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.44,736.667,"Well, there’s the 4%."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,736.667,736.901,There’s the 4%.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.901,746.172,And you just don’t think that it is necessary in legitimacy cases to individualize?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,746.172,768.782,"That’s what we get from reading Lalli in combination with Lucas and Jimenez is that, although the statute may be somewhat unjust in individual cases, as long as it’s finally tuned and substantially related it’s constitutional."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,768.782,774.55,"But it isn’t finely-tuned with respect to this one category of children, is it?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,774.55,779.592,"At most, there are 4% of the total universe and that’s a finely-tuned statute."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.592,782.706,"That 4% figure, I think is somewhat misleading, isn’t it?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,787.28,788.418,"Yes, it includes --"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.418,790.788,"I mean, it isn’t limited to that is what I mean."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,793.184,794.2,That’s --
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.2,813.565,"And where the statute already excludes illegitimate children who have not been acknowledged by their father, and the only relevance statistic and the additional requirement of “lived with” would be those who have not only lived with their parent, but also had been acknowledged, and your figure doesn’t take that into account at all."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,820.077,821.476,Right.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.476,827.224,"But isn’t the universe cut down to those who’ve been acknowledged by their father, by the statute?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,827.224,840.165,"But even so, there’s no more than 4% of any illegitimate children who are receiving support -- payments from their father."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.178,844.957,I just don’t see how that’s relevant to the “lived with” requirement.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,851.12,855.649,That may mean that the “lived with” requirement is somewhat over inclusive.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.649,861.1,"And probably didn’t -- well, may I ask you this on the “lived with” requirement."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,891.29,892.633,"Well, --"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.633,901.717,Under that said affair and how could Congress have reasonably assumed that he would then just walk away from the child and no further obligation?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,901.717,910.623,"Well, whether or not there was a court order that it doesn’t necessarily follow that he complied with it --"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.623,912.934,But which is the more probable?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,936.482,939.526,"Well, that’s the congressional judging."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.526,942.429,Do you think that Congress actually made that judgment?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,954.286,959.63,"That’s correct, and this is the construction that the agency is following --"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.63,962.14,It does exist and it followed in at least one case.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,969.495,969.784,No.
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,975.464,976.709,"Ever, ever?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,976.709,978.386,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.386,981.781,"But by implication, I suppose they did it here, didn’t they?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,981.781,984.592,"Well here, they didn’t -- they followed Gentry --"
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.592,991.53,"I mean, they wouldn’t have held it unconstitutional if they construed the statute as in the ways suggested by my brother Stevens' question?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,991.53,992.049,"That’s, that’s true."
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.049,992.481,Correct?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,992.481,994.68,That’s true.
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.101,997.558,It’s a constitutional.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,997.558,998.847,It’s a constitutional.
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.847,1004.568,Right and they wouldn’t certainly logic wouldn’t have held it unconstitutional had they construed the statute?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1004.568,1005.665,That’s true.
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.665,1006.212,The other way?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1006.212,1008.789,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.789,1039.942,"What would be the situation of an illegitimate child whose father having acknowledged as here was a military officer or foreign service officer moving from one place to another all over the world, and so he arrange to have the children and when they were in there teens for example to be in private schools in the school year and summer camps in the summer?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1039.942,1045.661,That would be considered to be living with in a normal parent-child relationship.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1046.141,1047.131,It would be?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1047.131,1047.897,"Yes, it would be."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1050.366,1050.973,That’s not consistent.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1050.973,1052.617,Under same roof.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1052.617,1056.196,That’s not consistent with the answer you gave me earlier.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1063.789,1079.921,"Well, if the situation is that they are in school or in summer camp or in other situation that’s similar to what happens was in normal parent-child relationship."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.921,1090.064,Do you know whether there are any administrative decisions that would be consistent with your answer in these cases?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1090.064,1095.613,I’m not aware of any that go along this line.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1095.613,1105.566,"I got the impression from your earlier discussion that “lived with” meant precise to that lived with in the normal, I thought you said normal and ordinary parent-child relationship?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1105.566,1124.564,"Well, I don’t think that sending a child to school with the intent that on summer vacations or when it’s feasible, they will resume the normal relationship of living together in the same house is inconsistent with living within the normal parent-child relationship."
1979.78-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.738,1131.516,"And all we’re dealing with is children under 18 years of age here, are we not?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1131.516,1132.047,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.047,1134.054,It is not the question about 30-year-old child --
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1134.054,1135.135,"Oh, no."
1979.78-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1135.135,1140.476,-- who might have lived with for 18 years and then simply became emancipated?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1140.476,1141.206,"No, no, no."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.846,1190.136,"If the people in these hypothetical situations where treated that way, then they are making an individualized judgment and not a rigid categorical judgment?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1204.694,1205.173,"Well, I think --"
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.173,1206.392,A familial home.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1206.392,1208.944,You’ve got two different situations.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1222.015,1228.164,"Let’s say, living with his grandmother and that the father is paying abundantly for support."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1228.164,1233.5,With no intent that they ever going to resume living together --
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.5,1235.335,Just exactly what I have told you?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1235.335,1245.966,"Well, in that case, that does not sound to me, again, this is something for the agency but it does not sound to me like the normal parent-child relationship."
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.014,1281.796,"Well, would you say that -- say that there is an acknowledged illegitimate child living with the father at the time of his death, but he has been supporting the child, does that -- is that -- would that be construed to be a regular parent-child relationship?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1281.796,1284.224,"If he is living with him, yes."
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.224,1286.026,"Well, he is not supporting him."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1286.026,1286.331,Well --
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.331,1287.295,He is just living with him.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1289.92,1295.389,"Well, that is what the statute -- the statute does not specifically says support, but the statute says --"
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.389,1297.96,It says regular parent-child relationship.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1297.96,1298.987,"Yes, but --"
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.987,1300.033,What do you mean by that?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1300.033,1304.888,That refers to the living with.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.888,1314.841,It must assume -- so it is not open to the Government to deny benefits on the ground that the father isn’t actually supporting the child?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1314.841,1323.626,Not if he is living in the same household with him or this is other situation.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.362,1434.641,What would that mean Mrs. Shapiro?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1436.78,1438.864,"Well, that’s one alternative."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.864,1442.795,"Well, that’s the alternative that you recommend."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1445.615,1455.565,"No, that’s -- if a suit in the Court of Claims -- our submission is that the Court of Claims is the wrong court in which to be presenting this claim."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.565,1456.713,It had no jurisdiction?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1456.713,1460.295,It had no jurisdiction because there was no accrued claim --
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1460.295,1465.081,Because jurisdiction is for claims for money based upon the constitutionary statute?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1465.081,1466.451,Exactly.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.451,1475.093,"But your position is that the plaintiff should then go to another forum and get an injunction against paying any child benefits to anybody, that’s what would have to be done if the statute --"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1475.093,1477.887,"In fact, that the --"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.887,1480.279,You think that is what Congress would have wanted in this situation?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1480.279,1483.069,In this particular situation --
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.069,1484.393,That upholds child’s benefits.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1484.393,1494.755,"These, for the Clark children are presumably part of the Jenkins class and the Jenkins case is in the District Court. [Voice overlap]"
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.755,1500.799,"But you argued there, do you -- does the Government argue there that all child’s benefits should cease until Congress remedies the situation?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1500.799,1501.341,No.
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.238,1517.078,Without statutory authority occurring [Voice Overlap]
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1517.078,1518.351,"Well, that’s right."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.625,1522.989,"But your argument there, I take it then, is that no benefits should be paid?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1522.989,1527.906,"The argument there is that no benefits should be paid before December 1, 1977."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.906,1529.069,But why even currently?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1530.856,1534.23,"Well, it is not a statutory authority."
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.112,1590.076,"Well, take, assume these plaintiffs were not in the Court of Claims, but were in the Federal District Court and assume they win on the merits, what remedy would be appropriate in the Government’s view?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1590.076,1592.94,If these children were in the District Court?
1979.78-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.94,1593.81,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1593.81,1605.031,"Well, then the Court would have two alternatives and we would not argue that the “lived with” requirement should be applied to all children."
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.543,1622.011,"But the Court would have the alternative of say, of enjoining any payments to any children at all?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1622.011,1622.834,Any payments --
1979.78-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1622.834,1630.187,That alternative was illustrated on the case last term in which Justice Powell disagreed with the holding of the Court?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1630.187,1631.625,I believe that’s --
1979.78-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.625,1660.053,"Mrs. Shapiro, we have had a number of cases you can almost learn who has been Secretary of HEW from the case as Weinberger, Matthews, Califano, etcetera and many of them have involved challenges to congressional limitations on payments to illegitimate children."
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1668.271,1674.633,I don’t believe so.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.773,1680.199,"Assume a three-judge Courts perhaps all of them, I am not sure?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1680.199,1682.754,Yes.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.721,1697.988,"In answering Mr. Justice Stevens, in what remedy would be available in District Court, you said, the Court would have a choice and it could order the payment of benefits, how about back benefits?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1697.988,1705.994,"No, that is the same -- that is barred by sovereign immunity and that’s the same argument in the District Court."
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.26,1718.476,"I understand, but you say that even if the District Court decided that you’ve been incorrectly construing the Act --"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1718.476,1719.091,That’s right.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.091,1722.949,-- and that you should have been paying these benefits the entire time.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1727.387,1728.177,Precisely.
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.177,1731.979,"Because as you construed the Act, Congress has not waived sovereign immunity to that extent?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1731.979,1734.937,"That’s exactly right, yes."
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.414,1747.167,Is there some authority for that?
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1748.914,1750.686,This is what we --
1979.78-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.686,1752.454,In fact that the Court of Claims disagrees with you.
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1752.454,1763.014,"Well, we retest this Court’s decision in Testan; Edelman v. Jordan certainly suggests that result."
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.014,1777.536,"On your hypothesis responding to Mr. Justice White, the only remedy then to enforce the judgment of the Court of Claims would be to get a private bill in the Congress?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1777.536,1780.07,For retroactive benefits.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.705,1814.43,"At times, the Court of Claims in -- not in these situations, but in some where back payments were involved, having their opinions recommended that the Congress make up an active private bill, have they not?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1814.43,1815.464,I am not sure.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1818.479,1824.671,"It was established as an arm of Congress, of course, originally?"
1979.78-1513,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1824.671,1827.798,I see my time is up.
1979.78-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.798,1828.754,Mr. Merrigan.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,1828.754,1831.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.052,1966.052,"So, would you say that he was doing what was suggested in some of the hypothetical questions that is he was providing support for them without providing a familial home for them?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,1966.052,1976.2,He did everything for the children except to [Attempt to Laughter] marry the mother and continued to actually live with them physically until the date of his death from about 1972 to 1974.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.251,2015.635,But the difference in opinion between you is that the “lived with” has to be at the time of the death?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2015.635,2017.477,"Well, I think if you construe the statute itself --"
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.477,2018.894,"Did the Government said, or did it say not?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2018.894,2020.5,"Mr. Justice Stewart, you construe the --"
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2020.5,2021.722,"Well, isn’t that --"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2021.722,2022.311,That’s the difference.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2022.311,2024.091,Have I directly identified the difference of opinion?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2024.091,2040.608,"When we sued in the Court of Claims, we specifically asked the Court to award a judgment here based on an Act of Congress with the “lived with” requirement in the law because we say that it says “lived with”, it does not say “live with” or “living with” in the statute."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.916,2063.065,"Well, then by the Court of Claims?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2063.065,2064.242,"Well, not really by the Court of Claims."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.242,2068.114,"How could they have held it unconstitutional, had they not construed it the way the Government does?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2068.114,2071.962,"Well, I think that the statute was declared unconstitutional in Gentry."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2075.118,2078.813,"I know there is no long discussion on it, but as a matter of logic, how could they have it?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2078.813,2093.434,"They simply held that the “lived with” requirement, as I am trying to point, Your Honor, in a moment, is simply a total bar to any recovery for illegitimates in 90% of the cases by the very term illegitimate, [Attempt to Laughter] meaning that the father and mother are not married."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.012,2113.658,"So, but you’re not arguing that your clients can meet the “lived with” requirement?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2113.658,2147.42,"We say that in this case, truly, jurisdiction in this case I think, this case should be settled in our judgment if we can propose to the Court that if you looked at the statute and construed that they had lived with for the period of time that we just referred to, that there was the support, that they did meet the requirement of the statute, and therefore, the Court of Claims clearly had jurisdiction because we are suing on an Act of Congress where including the “lived with” requirement and therefore they are entitled to judgment on this 28 U.S.C. 1491."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.42,2152.48,You’re seeking the support of judgment on a different ground than the Court of Claims gave you judgment?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2152.48,2163.064,"I say that this Court could if it wanted to avoid the constitutional question in this case say that the statute properly construed, should have grant a judgment here without reaching the constitutional question."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.064,2179.362,"What if the father had lived with the child for the first three months of its life and then not lived with it for the subsequent 17 years, nine months of its life and the child was 18 at the time of the father’s death?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2179.362,2186.181,"When you start these types of requirements in the statute, obviously, as you change the facts, it gets even worse, it gets better."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.181,2189.334,"Yes, isn't that just why Congress has to draw a line?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2189.334,2192.972,"Well, Congress did not draw the line at “lived with” or “living with”."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.608,2206.816,"But what were the -- no one has any claim under an amendment that is proposed in Congress today, did it?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2206.816,2210.194,I do not say that we are relying on the amendment that is proposed today.
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.046,2225.44,But the agency construction is of the present language is “living with?”
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2225.44,2228.889,"“Living with,” I think they have changed the Act of Congress."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.95,2258.488,But wasn't your -- wasn't -- did the Court of Claims reject your construction of the statute in Gentry?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2258.488,2258.723,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.723,2261.277,I know you weren’t in Gentry but was that issue before you were on it?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2261.277,2265.372,"No, Your Honor, It was not because the children never lived with their parent in Gentry."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.87,2273.027,"But the Court of Claims, in affect then in this case, rejected your statutory claim?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2273.027,2275.118,"No, the Court of Claims did not pass on it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.374,2280.476,What makes you think it didn’t enter a judgment?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2280.476,2284.807,"Well, what I think happened in our case, Your Honor, is this."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.896,2304.068,Are you suggesting that any federal court has the authority to reach a constitutional issue without first passing on a necessarily included statutory question?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2304.068,2316.029,"I think in this case, if Your Honors will look at the judgment in this case, which is of course in the appendix, what happened is the Court of Claims had previously ruled a “lived with” provision to be unconstitutional."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.21,2328.136,Any way here?
1979.78-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.136,2330.796,But doesn’t that mean they were adopting the Gentry approach?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2330.796,2336.669,I think they – there’s no question but that the Court of Claims in our case ruled that the statute was unconstitutional.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.31,2629.119,She has to prove the father acknowledge the child?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2629.119,2630.141,No.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.42,2640.002,"Well, she does have to prove that the child or children were the father -- the issue of the father."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2640.002,2640.507,"Well, the children --"
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.507,2642.78,But you say that can be proved by her perjury?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2642.78,2644.593,It could be proved spuriously.
1979.78-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.599,2657.438,"What about the word “recognized stepchild” or “recognized natural child,” doesn’t that mean recognized by the natural father?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2657.438,2657.698,"Recognized, right."
1979.78-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.698,2659.228,"I could assume that it did, yes."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2662.481,2670.331,The woman could recover on other grants because adopted children or stepchildren could be included in the same “lived with” requirement.
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.437,2708.778,But she would have to perjure herself both as to the question whether the father was the actual father and as to whether he recognized the child.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2708.778,2710.355,"Well, Your Honor, I think that is true."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.355,2722.101,"I mean, presumably, there are an of a lot of lawsuits you can imagine that could go of on an unjust result as a result of perjury which wasn't detected by the finder of fact."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2722.101,2732.384,I raised the possibility only because one of the defenses for this statute is that it was enacted to protect the Government rather against spurious claims.
1979.78-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2732.384,2735.504,You don’t need a broad holding here to support your position.

1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2764.397,2769.214,How does the commission construe the word “recognized?”

1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.999,2783.45,"But in all of these hypotheticals you give, the recognition is rather important, isn’t it?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2783.45,2784.631,"Well, it’s rather important."
1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.692,2794.432,"You have an easy case, but you have been arguing with a rather broad brush, I suggest?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2794.432,2798.951,"The word recognition, of course, I think is clear cut in any case where you have an order affiliation."
1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2798.951,2800.293,"It’s clear cut here, yes."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2800.293,2802.208,Such as you have in Montana.
1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2802.208,2802.542,Yes.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2811.7,2815.518,"I want you to understand, Your Honor, that that idea did not only originated with me."
1979.78-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2820.458,2826.308,"But all you are saying today is that there must be a court order, so far as you are concerned?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2826.308,2827.593,"Certainly, there should be it."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.728,2979.835,But you need a track on it.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2983.397,2989.364,"Well, Your Honor, the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to render judgments on the Constitution as well as on the --"
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.364,2990.782,"Yes, because nothing in the Constitution that --"
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.782,2991.805,It was founded on the Constitution --
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.805,2997.377,"Nothing on the Constitution that entitles your plans to prepayment of any kind, for anything?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,2997.377,3006.003,"Well, the claim based on the Constitution here would be that they are entitled to judgment [Attempt to Laughter] under the statute as interpreted in the Court on the Fifth Amendment."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.003,3007.185,But not as enactment?
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.185,3023.537,Do you think the Constitution would require the Treasury to draw a check to your clients without any Act of Congress in establishing a Social Security System?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3023.537,3025.469,"No, I don't think that’s true at all, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.326,3029.883,"How can you say, this is a claim founded on the Constitution?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3029.883,3038.572,I say that this is a claim founded on the Act of Congress with the power of the Court of Claims to sever an unconstitutional provision from that statute.
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.626,3072.79,But you say they had declared that it was unconstitutional in order to get to it?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3072.79,3074.496,"Not the whole statute, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.496,3079.114,"If, well but apart -- this is a large statute."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3082.512,3084.918,They declared a tiny sentence in this statute.
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3084.918,3087.1,"Well, a section of the statute --"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3087.1,3087.764,A section of the statute.
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3087.764,3090.626,-- of which there was bore on your client’s rights.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3090.626,3101.262,"That’s correct, but what I am trying to say to you, Your Honor, then that they then pegged their decision very firmly on an Act of Congress with the voided provision out of it."
1979.78-1513,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3123.062,3136.566,"Mr. Merrigan, is it correct to say that your argument comes down to whether the statute is severable, whether that section is severable and if it is, then you say, jurisdictional question is resolved?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3136.566,3137.634,I think that’s correct.
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.634,3141.153,That was the Court of Claims’ argument in Gentry?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3141.153,3143.62,"That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.62,3149.779,Without being able to say in any prior authority to that effect?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3149.779,3154.522,"I think the Court of Claims did cite some authorities [Attempt to Laughter] to that effect, although it escapes my mind at the moment."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.522,3157.146,"Yes, I may have."
1979.78-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.146,3164.619,"The Court of Claims certainly has had a propensity throughout its life to try to expand its jurisdiction, hasn’t it?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3164.619,3168.322,"Well, I hope we won’t find this case as the limiting factor on that propensity but --"
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.322,3174.008,"May I ask you, do you recall Judge Skelton’s concurring position?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3174.008,3174.902,"I do recall it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.902,3178.708,Did you present that position in your case or not?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3178.708,3183.291,"We relied on Gentry totally, as well the concurring opinion of Judge Skelton."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.291,3208.461,"So you said, not only should the statute be construed to award benefits when the “living with” had occurred any time, but you have also argued that the statute should be construed to permit proof of support in any case?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3208.461,3210.017,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.017,3220.517,"And because the Court of Claims apparently rejected that position in Gentry, but you represented it -- you presented it in your case anyway?"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3220.517,3220.947,We did.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3236.128,3248.094,"Mr. Merrigan, you have not addressed orally, unless I missed it to the question of sovereign immunity with respect to the back payments."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3248.094,3254.444,"Your Honor, clearly, the statute itself provides for payments from the moment of death of the federal employee."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3296.754,3297.858,"Well, that’s what sovereign immunity means."
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3307.528,3319.544,"And that usually arises in the case where there is no statute passed by the Congress authorizing the payment of the debt of the United States and here, there is a clear cut debt of the United States running back to the very day that the employee died."
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.544,3331.929,"And otherwise, the Government will come in and say, “Of course, you are within the class that was intended to be benefited by the statute and we owe you the money, but you just cannot sue for it.”"
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3331.929,3333.83,I think that’s generally correct and by the way --
1979.78-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.83,3336.206,You mean that would be the position.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3336.206,3336.872,That would be it.
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.459,3392.465,This lawsuit wasn't brought as a class action?
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3392.465,3392.98,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3393.688,3394.683,Always an individual action.
1979.78-1513,1,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3394.683,3396.178,Always an individual action.
1979.78-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.083,3397.853,Thank you counsel.
