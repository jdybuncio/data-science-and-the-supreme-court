1995.94-1837,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.229,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1837, the Barnett Bank of Marion County v. Bill Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,11.91,14.892,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.402,168.534,"Mr. Lewin, I assume that the Florida courts and the... or the Eleventh Circuit's view of the matter is that the Florida statute is a statute that governs insurance."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,192.479,200.346,"--The statutes, Justice Scalia, of course use the word regulate in the first portion of--"
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.346,201.077,Right.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,201.077,213.435,"--the section, and it says that the State law, in order to even satisfy the first of these two hurdles, has to have as its purpose regulating the business of insurance."
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.842,253.794,"I agree with you that any legislation that regulates insurance relates to insurance, but does any legislation that regulates insurance specifically relate to insurance?"
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,253.794,255.944,"--It does, Justice--"
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.944,258.696,You could regulate it... can't you regulate insurance in passing?
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,272.606,296.152,"--But the word specifically, we submit, means to distinguish between the statutes that would include insurance within some broader statutory term, commercial services, various kind... but certainly a statute specifically relates to insurance when the word insurance appears in that statute five times."
1995.94-1837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.728,325.704,"Mr. Lewin, even so, why can't one read these two provisions, the State and Federal, as compatible, as not in conflict?"
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,351.87,355.493,"--Justice Ginsburg, there are several answers, I think, to that question."
1995.94-1837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.709,489.38,Mr. Lewin--
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,500.918,501.538,No.
1995.94-1837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.538,503.26,--couldn't be regulated by Florida?
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,503.26,505.06,"Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-1837,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.144,601.06,"Well, Mr. Lewin, the other side argues that there is a public motive, that you don't want the banks too closely tied up with the insurance in connection with a loan."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,601.06,605.472,--We understand that that is what they are saying.
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.385,630.961,"That motive wouldn't explain allowing banks that are not part of bank holding companies to do it, would it?"
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,634.134,643.62,"--It does not prohibit banks that are in communities of less than 5,000 that are not subsidiary to bank holding companies."
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.62,663.375,"And the rationale of stopping banks, the procompetitive rationale of preventing banks from getting all of the business when they make the real estate loan, that makes no... no reason to limit it to nonbank holding companies."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,663.375,663.596,That's true.
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.324,673.625,The statute doesn't refer to--
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,680.589,681.47,"No, it does not."
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.47,691.456,"So that would be, I suppose, the field in which you would assume the banks would be most overbearing in trying to exercise their authority, and yet that's exempted."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,691.456,700.753,It's true there are really a number of very good rational arguments that demonstrate that this is not the purpose.
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.143,749.255,"What do you say to the argument, the kind of subsidiary argument, to be sure, but what do you say to the argument that because the effect is to regulate what your opponents describe as the point of sale of the insurance, that therefore you simply must impute a purpose to regulate insurance to that effect, and therefore the purpose prong of the statute is satisfied?"
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,749.255,752.056,"Well, we think that goes too far."
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.125,766.217,So it would read the intent requirement out of the--
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,766.217,766.408,--this Court's opinions--
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,766.408,770.462,"--As a distinction it would read the intent requirement out, you're saying."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,770.462,803.413,"--We think it would not... it would not be an effective and useful distinction, and indeed, this Court's opinions in Pireno and in... in the prior cases, where the Court was considering these, the Court rejected the argument that simply looking to either the solvency of the insurance company, whether it would ultimately be solvent, whether it would... and its impact on policyholders was a sufficient basis for saying that its purpose was the regulation--"
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.413,804.715,That would have to have gone the other way.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,804.715,804.835,--of the business of insurance.
1995.94-1837,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.835,805.175,Yes.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,805.175,816.374,And the Pireno case does lay down three standards that make it clear that what we're dealing with is really the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder.
1995.94-1837,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.416,893.559,Are there cases in the courts of appeals where a State has what on its face appears to be a neutral law that in effect prohibits the national bank from acting as an agent?
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,900.905,945.026,"I don't know, off-hand, of any... the cases in the courts of appeals have involved more specific... I mean, the Owensboro case and the Louisiana case that has come up through the Louisiana courts have involved more specific statutes that are directed, really, at financial institutions or banks rather than in this more indirect manner to my knowledge, but I think the same question would come up if, in fact, the State were trying to reach national banks' power under section 92 by camouflaging what they were really doing by making it appear to be a different--"
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.026,945.745,I don't know.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,971.545,973.506,"--Well, there are--"
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.506,979.519,But not a regulation that says you cannot be an insurance agent if you're also the lender.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,979.519,980.808,--That would apply.
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.866,1031.805,"Well, maybe it wouldn't, but I am much less inclined to come out the way you would like me to with regard to the question of whether section 92 specifically relates to insurance."
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1045.797,1053.784,"No, I think a more narrow statute that would reach certain kinds of practices would certainly be good."
1995.94-1837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.753,1066.542,--And that would be okay.
1995.94-1837,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1073.629,1076.681,--Any lender to this consumer--
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1222.715,1236.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1837,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1283.179,1296.248,"Mr. Bress, is the term, relates to insurance broader than the term, regulates insurance in the other portion of McCarran-Ferguson?"
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1296.248,1297.54,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1995.94-1837,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.159,1313.412,Where do you get that definition of relates to from?
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1313.412,1319.005,"--Well, this Court used that definition... in fact, you used other broader terms in Morales and in Shaw."
1995.94-1837,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.005,1322.168,Were those cases construing this particular act?
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1322.168,1326.001,"No, I was... Your Honor, I was just getting to the words relates to."
1995.94-1837,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.683,1330.055,And get perhaps closer to this act.
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1330.055,1330.496,--Certainly.
1995.94-1837,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1372.844,1384.473,"Mr. Bress, in Fabe, this Court came pretty close to requiring a sort of clear statement rule for a law that relates to insurance by the Federal Government."
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1384.473,1397.302,"Your Honor, in its... I agree, in its description of that prong of the McCarran-Ferguson test, this Court stated that it was a plain statement rule and used language to that effect."
1995.94-1837,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1401.726,1409.773,"Well, if it is a... if there is some clear statement requirement, do you think this section 92 meets it here?"
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1409.773,1412.896,"--Well, I guess that would depend what clear statement meant."
1995.94-1837,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.839,1463.162,"But the sentence Justice O'Connor refers to says the first clause of 2(b) reverses this by imposing what is in effect a clear statement rule, a rule that State law is enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, do not yield to conflicting Federal statutes unless a Federal statute specifically requires otherwise."
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1467.726,1468.607,"You may well, Your Honor."
1995.94-1837,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.273,1488.892,"If we follow the position that Senator Ferguson has been quoted as taking, we would require at least that there be... I'm sorry, we would require that there be an express reference to insurance, is that correct?"
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1488.892,1490.303,We would find in most cases--
1995.94-1837,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1490.303,1492.904,"Not an express reference to preemption, but an express reference to insurance."
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1492.904,1501.249,"--In almost all cases you would want to find the word insurance, or at least other words that meant insurance, in the statute itself, yes."
1995.94-1837,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.249,1506.374,"What kind of other words do you... you mean reference to specific policies, things like that?"
1995.94-1837,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1506.374,1506.523,Exactly.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,1855.97,1863.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1837,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.776,1913.046,Suppose--
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,1977.58,1983.564,"I think first of all you go to the core of the business of insurance, and you start there, and the core--"
1995.94-1837,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.564,1993.78,"Right at the core, making money out of the policy, keeping the money there available for the policyholders so that the company won't go bankrupt, and so forth."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,1993.78,2019.037,"--Well, the core of the business of insurance goes to the issues of enforceability, the reliability, and I think also the suitability of an insurance contract, so if you're regulating the business of insurance, you are regulating the policyholder's protection over a current promise, a current contract for a future promise."
1995.94-1837,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.768,2028.904,"So that's like from... that's rates, regulating selling and advertising, licensing companies and their agents, and relationship between the insured and the insurer."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2033.759,2034.46,"--Yes, sir."
1995.94-1837,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.46,2034.73,All right.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2079.842,2087.956,"Okay, let's basically start with the fundamentals of the regulation of the business of insurance and the insurer-policyholder relationship."
1995.94-1837,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.548,2271.289,It doesn't apply to banks.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2272.501,2287.932,"--Okay, if you want to talk about... I think one of the issues is, why is there a prohibition against bank holding companies and not all banks in allowing the small town bank to sell insurance in Florida?"
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2326.156,2330.408,If that is the object why did they accept credit life?
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2330.408,2348.39,"Well, first of all, I think that in the legislature's judgment I believe there was a sense that with regard to credit life three was more of a nexus between the bank's interest in protecting loans and protecting credit than there was in the sale of other insurance."
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2348.39,2351.013,That... maybe I don't understand.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2377.303,2381.123,"I think that was a legislative judgment, but again--"
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.123,2390.359,"No, but if... but it's a legislative judgment that seems to me to be at odds with the rationale that you were saying was the legislative purpose within the meaning of the statute."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2390.359,2391.631,"--Oh, I think it is at odds."
1995.94-1837,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.567,2450.622,"Well, I suppose you could say that no statute pursues its objectives at all costs, and the legislature just said there's such a overwhelming reason why a bank would want to sell its own insurance in these situations that although the same risks might exist, we won't extend our prohibition that far."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2452.864,2468.474,"Yes, sir, and I believe that... one other thing I would want to point out is one of the dangers which is identified which is somewhat overlooked, and which has been found in Florida, is the issue of unfair trade practices."
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.887,2511.362,"Suppose I don't look at the legislative history of any of this and think, well, gee, to a person looking at this statute, the only purpose I can imagine it would have is that it wants to help the little banks make more money by preventing the competition from the big banks, and it wants to raise the prices to the insurers who are buying the policies, and as a result, everybody is more secure."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2520.666,2520.726,Yes.
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2520.726,2527.191,"They want, by stopping competition, to make everybody make more money and the insured then has a better chance of getting a payoff on his policy."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2536.418,2540.731,"I don't think so, because--"
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2540.731,2543.364,"In other words, it's outside the McCarran Act's exception."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2554.101,2555.023,--That's correct.
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2555.023,2557.093,"All right, then why would that be?"
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2579.931,2593.467,"Well, I think that as long as McCarran-Ferguson requires that the law be enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, that there needs to be an inquiry into the purpose, and the purpose has to flow to regulation of the business of insurance."
1995.94-1837,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2608.55,2611.054,But the purpose here is to keep the big banks out.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2627.457,2658.879,"Well, it depends on whether or not your keeping the big banks out through the regulation of the insurance agent and their association with the bank is regulation, whether or not that, in looking at that law, that there is a relationship there where that... that law regulates, that is, controls, adjusts, or manages the business of insurance, that is that whether it adjusts controls or manages a peril to the insurer-policyholder relationship."
1995.94-1837,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.879,2668.647,"Mr. Sumner, with respect to the purpose of the Florida law, are you claiming any mileage as a result of the Florida supreme court decision?"
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2670.119,2672.55,That's a district court of appeal case.
1995.94-1837,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.201,2677.692,Is there a Florida supreme court decision interpreting this statute?
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2677.692,2679.024,"No, ma'am, there's not."
1995.94-1837,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.024,2681.137,"There's only the district, Federal district court."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2681.137,2681.487,"Yes, ma'am."
1995.94-1837,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.44,2684.819,District court of appeal.
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2684.819,2686.741,"--District court of appeal, yes, ma'am."
1995.94-1837,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.842,2692.275,"But this is a State intermediate appellate court, then."
1995.94-1837,2,21531,daniel_y_sumner,,2692.275,2692.775,"--Yes, ma'am."
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2782.088,2789.573,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1837,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.793,2835.224,"Well, it's not quite that easy."
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2874.43,2876.313,--Perhaps I overstated it.
1995.94-1837,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2880.857,2912.119,"No, but he wasn't conceding that there was... there was kind of, as I put it, an equal protection clause here for State and Federal banks, and in fact the argument is, for which there has been I think some evidence adduced here in the courtroom, that in fact the point of the statute was to allow them to get into the insurance business so that they could earn money and, generally speaking, be more competitive against their State rivals, and it seems to me that's what you've got to refute here."
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2912.119,2928.858,"Your Honor, the legislative history, and although it is very scant here, there is one letter from the Comptroller who drafted this legislation and proposed it to the Congress, who accepted that proposal as written and in fact used this letter as explanation, the sole explanation for the statute."
1995.94-1837,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2929.329,2941.307,"And the drafting of the statute is consistent with that in the sense that the statute says nothing about, may sell insurance if State banks sell insurance, may sell it if State regulation allows."
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2948.38,2963.9,"--Your Honor, in fact the letter makes absolutely clear that what the Comptroller was worried about was allowing them to get additional revenue, but additional revenue in order to enable them to compete with State-chartered banks who had these very powers, Your Honor."
1995.94-1837,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2963.9,2979.071,"Well, sure, if they go out of business they can't compete, but I mean, the argument was, they need the additional revenue because, given the sort of piddling deposits that they tend to get in these little towns, they just can't earn enough money to stay in business if they haven't got some other revenue source."
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2980.683,2984.284,And they were having problems competing with State banks who had this authority.
1995.94-1837,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.656,2987.346,We don't limit the terms of a statute by its purpose.
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3024.684,3028.067,"--Your Honor, the Fellows case is very instructive."
1995.94-1837,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.307,3044.779,"Fellows, you're talking about?"
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3044.779,3047.311,"--Yes, correct, Your Honor, First National Bank v. Fellows."
1995.94-1837,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.483,3109.045,They don't contend that here.
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3117.843,3119.976,"It says they're fully regulable by the State, Your Honor."
1995.94-1837,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.976,3122.347,They acknowledge that they're regulable here.
1995.94-1837,3,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3130.184,3131.276,"Your Honor, that's what the Fellows case was talking about."
