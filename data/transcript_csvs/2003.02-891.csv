2003.02-891,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,9.454,12.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-891,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,90.158,97.793,"In the... in the guidance that is given, does the... has the IRS actually passed on particular amendments?"
2003.02-891,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,97.793,100.56,"It has, not in formal guidance."
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1085.215,1101.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.261,1123.831,Could you address one... one question I have?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1133.612,1145.872,"--That is... I think that... well, actually I think that because the... the qualification provisions are coextensive with the ERISA provisions, that I think that they rise or fall together."
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.872,1148.101,Have we ever said that?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1148.101,1154.75,I think that the... the... thing is the language of the... the provisions is substantially identical.
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.705,1172.622,"The Treasury Department, of course, is interpreting... is interpreting the statute for the purpose of deciding whether... the income tax consequences of contributions basically."
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1172.622,1181.416,"That is correct, but they have been vested under reorganization plan number four with the authority to construe the exact same provisions, the corresponding provisions of title I of ERISA that we're talking about here."
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.961,1198.218,"The thing that runs through my mind is I'm not sure they have the same expertise, for example, as if the Department of Labor had to give them the same... same answer to this question."
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1198.218,1206.884,"They have been charged with interpreting these provisions, the same provisions of title I of ERISA, the 204, 203 here as in the corresponding provisions of the code."
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.086,1220.054,"But the concern at issue in this case is the ability of people to move in and out of the... out of the trade, which is specifically a Labor Department interest."
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1226.453,1237.72,"--In any event, the... the Department of the Treasury has been charged with the responsibility and because it's identical language, we would argue that they're entitled to just as much reference under that as under title I of ERISA--"
2003.02-891,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1237.72,1242.633,And the... the Labor Department has not adopted a position on this question--
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1242.633,1244.574,--The Labor Department agrees with this position.
2003.02-891,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1252.004,1255.059,"--Now, may I ask you about section 203?"
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1264.514,1269.382,--It governs normal benefits and their actuarial equivalents.
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.437,1294.44,May I ask you to... to comment on an argument that Mr. Goldstein just made?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1341.086,1349.342,--I think there is reason to believe that Congress was concerned with the cyclical nature of industries for which market... which are covered typically by multiemployer plans.
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1349.342,1350.168,How do we... how do we know that?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1353.883,1354.915,I think two things.
2003.02-891,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.89,1377.123,"Well, but you don't... we don't have to adopt your provision to... to accord that flexibility."
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1408.292,1412.872,"Actually, Justice Scalia, it I think explicitly indicates that it contemplates that."
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1431.819,1433.017,"Yes, but that--"
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1436.445,1436.938,"--Oh, sure."
2003.02-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.938,1439.333,--if you're interested in our comprehending what you're saying.
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1443.42,1447.961,The... page 50 is just the explanation that the plan is amendable.
2003.02-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.763,1456.606,Whereabouts are you reading?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1456.606,1458.363,"--It's under (d)(1), page 46."
2003.02-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.363,1458.735,Okay.
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1458.735,1459.561,(d)(1).
2003.02-891,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.852,1482.967,It doesn't say anything about amendments.
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1492.543,1493.203,--No.
2003.02-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.538,1561.746,--What... what would happen if there were a... a suspension if you were working in any other industry?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1564.801,1585.978,"I think that a plan could adopt a suspension rule with respect to future plan accruals for any reemployment, but it is the Government's position that because what Congress is trying to control here was... was basically to give plans the flexibility so that their... their participants would not have to compete or, rather, have to subsidize their competitors--"
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.978,1592.088,But what is... what is the provision of the statute which is... which... on which you rest to make that distinction--
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1592.088,1592.748,--That--
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.748,1594.401,--as to whether it's very important for the construction industry?
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1596.259,1606.927,"--It's for section 203(a)(3)(B), or 1053(a)(3)(B), which is set forth at the yellow brief on page... I think it's 1a to 2a."
2003.02-891,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.75,1637.308,"If this is so central to your case, how come it only shows up in your... in the reply brief?"
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1637.763,1638.134,No.
2003.02-891,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.248,1650.727,--You... you've been dying to respond to something I raised.
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1652.335,1652.585,Okay.
2003.02-891,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.958,1703.444,"Mr. Elwood, you--"
2003.02-891,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1705.507,1706.583,Thank you.
2003.02-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.583,1709.594,"Mr. Gossett, it's your turn."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1709.594,1721.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1753.061,1754.798,Let's assume I... I agree with you on that.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1786.498,1787.491,"--Yes, Justice Souter."
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.491,1788.81,What part are we... how does that--
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1788.81,1800.41,"Under Internal Revenue Code section 7805(b), the IRS has the right to say that any amendment before the date of this... of this Court's decision in this case wouldn't lead to a disqualification of... of the plan."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.41,1829.594,"--Oh, I don't think they could because you have an answer there to question 6 which says that if you put in your original plan a provision that would say the employer can change the definition of who's working in his same company over time, as labor circumstances call for it, that that gives the employer discretion, and you can't do it because giving them that discretion would itself count as a reduction."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1843.34,1845.735,"No, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.649,1869.762,"The whole point of 203, as I understand it, is that it was something put in there by the Teamsters or possibly the crafts unions so that when you get your... your early retirement benefit and you're out there, don't come back to my plant."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1906.748,1909.615,"--That's not why it's there, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.615,1910.714,Why is it there?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1910.714,1918.516,"Section... section 203(a)(3)(B), for starters, only applies to normal retirement benefits."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.213,1940.928,"Put a little footnote here that I may not agree with your statement, but go ahead."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,1940.928,1941.3,--Okay.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.91,1983.531,That... that would be an odd purpose.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2024.149,2025.263,"Well, in... there... there are--"
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.263,2028.485,"They're... they're talking about going back to my plant, isn't it?"
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2028.485,2031.457,"--In the context of a single employer plan, which is--"
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.457,2032.2,That's... am I right about that?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2035.71,2035.877,--Sorry.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.401,2047.682,I thought that--
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2047.682,2048.713,--That's all you can--
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.713,2059.449,"--if I've retired early and I'm an expert trouser maker, I could go back to work for Justice Ginsburg's plant and nobody would care as far as this provision is concerned."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2060.025,2062.914,--If your pension fund was a single--
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.914,2063.164,Yes.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2063.702,2064.157,--employer pension fund.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.9,2065.393,--All right.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2065.393,2068.447,"But in the multiemployer context, it's... it's only about cross-subsidization."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.819,2097.344,"The reason is supposedly... what they say is the reason we want to change the rules is because labor conditions change and whereas in this year where the plant... where the economy is booming, I don't really have a problem, at least my workers don't, with retirees coming back and depressing their wages."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2112.083,2113.485,--Not exactly.
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.485,2117.406,"Then... then you're not changing the rules when you change the rules, so to speak."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2136.519,2137.734,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.838,2156.31,And the only--
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2156.31,2157.984,Both of those would... sorry.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.984,2161.124,--I want to get the answer to Justice Scalia's before you lose that.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2161.124,2161.528,This is--
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2161.528,2169.585,"Now, I thought that what he was suggesting was not possible because of the reason of the answer to question 6."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2172.391,2180.087,--The answer to question 6 in the... in the regulations is a subsidiary answer.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.416,2184.545,"No, but I want to know first if I'm right or wrong."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2184.545,2184.795,Yes.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.774,2187.229,I am right.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2187.229,2192.801,--discretionary on the... to the plan to cut back... to do something because of plan funding.
2003.02-891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.38,2246.96,"Yes, but if... if your hypothesis is that even when it says they're promised nothing, in other words, that they... it can be changed retroactively... you're... you're saying that that is a promise that's not kept?"
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2246.96,2251.751,"That is a promise that is kept on the most technical level, of course."
2003.02-891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.019,2254.845,You can't complain.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2254.845,2255.877,--one simply can't complain.
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.991,2269.889,I thought it was 203 that... that provided that guarantee.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2277.425,2281.14,"It is both 203 and 204, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.14,2282.792,I don't see how 204 does it.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2282.792,2291.337,"The... the... Mr. Goldstein tries to differentiate 203 and 204 and argue that they're completely distinct beasts, the one not affecting the other."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.77,2324.735,My... my true question... it isn't... it isn't... I think there's no easy answer to this case.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2355.116,2356.147,--Thank you.
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.147,2357.179,--either-way possibility.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2372.783,2373.32,Okay.
2003.02-891,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2489.362,2502.198,"But it's not... if your... if your position prevails, then I take it the only way an employer can protect himself against hard times is to say for this class of early retirees, no employment."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2525.892,2527.462,"--I... I disagree, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2601.477,2603.873,You're... you're back to the word reduction where I agree with you.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2640.692,2649.32,"--What's going on is that... Justice Breyer, is that plans... that... that unions and the employers want to prevent cross-subsidization."
2003.02-891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.689,2715.717,"It's certainly designed to protect plans in some respects, the preemption, that sort of thing."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2715.717,2733.655,"--Yes, that's true, but that's largely an indirect way of protecting the plan... the plans and more indirectly the... the participants and more indirectly the participants and more indirectly the Federal fisc because, of course, plans are... are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Board."
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2733.655,2739.682,"Am I right about this, that... that the... that there is a specific provision in there for the... for the protection of the plans?"
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2759.95,2760.693,"With the... yes, Justice Souter."
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2764.408,2764.674,Okay.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2764.674,2768.389,"--to the Secretary of Labor and consent, you can pass an amendment in a plan that--"
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2768.389,2769.504,And that would... that would--
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2769.504,2770.208,--reduces benefits.
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2770.208,2776.274,--be... that would be a redundancy on... on the argument that your... your colleagues on the other side make then I take it.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2778.299,2779.125,Yes.
2003.02-891,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2779.125,2779.885,Yes.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2800.134,2807.482,"I don't think this Court needs to reach the question because the plan in this case doesn't, in fact, include that provision."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2807.482,2807.936,"No, I understand that."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2807.936,2811.568,But I think that that plan provision would not be permissible.
2003.02-891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.568,2812.644,"Yes, I think that's right."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2816.277,2816.936,"Yes, yes, I agree with that."
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.846,2818.627,Because of what?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2821.106,2834.685,--I think that it is on the narrow... on the narrow end... it's a technical level... it's precluded under the IRS's own regulations which point out that you can't have... you can't change conditions in a way that violates missions.
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.098,2838.196,I want the statutory provision.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2843.496,2843.952,--204(g).
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.952,2844.528,Yes.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2844.528,2846.081,204(g)(1) which says you can't decrease benefits.
2003.02-891,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.743,2868.122,"And this is what we were discussing before and you spell this out in your brief, and you were very candid in saying Justice Scalia's solution wouldn't work."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2868.122,2869.486,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.483,2980.57,"I think that they... that the... (c) being there shows no more than, that the words, shall provide, which is the beginning of 203, do not mean shall provide in the original plan."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,2993.202,3000.139,"The term provide is not in 203(a)(1)(A) and (B), which are the--"
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.139,3004.719,"It says at the very beginning, (A), each pension plan shall provide that."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3015.743,3023.106,"--Justice Breyer, the amendment of a plan is authorized under ERISA section 402(b)(3)."
2003.02-891,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.898,3058.589,We're back to the circle.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3101.564,3105.279,I think that the text of the statute is pretty clearly on my side.
2003.02-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3126.827,3138.799,But you do acknowledge that plans have been making these changes and the IRS has been accepting them for purposes of the employer's tax deductions.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3138.799,3140.74,"--I know, Justice--"
2003.02-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3140.74,3141.278,Is that right?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3141.278,3143.629,"--I know, Justice O'Connor, that they did so in this case."
2003.02-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3152.052,3155.683,"Now, section 203 refers to normal retirement plans."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3160.802,3167.778,--Section 203(a)(3)(B) doesn't apply to the subsidized portion of early retirement benefits.
2003.02-891,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3271.93,3277.957,Was that distinction made in the Seventh Circuit between the early retirement benefits with regard to the application of 203(a)?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3277.957,3279.526,--Sorry.
2003.02-891,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.526,3289.392,Was that... was that an argument that you presented to the Seventh Circuit distinguishing the early retirements benefits from normal retirement benefits for 203(a) purposes?
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3300.909,3315.398,"203(a) applies to early retirement benefits to the extent that they are the actuarial equivalent, the net present... the financial equivalent of normal retirement benefits, but not to the subsidized portion of... of them."
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.525,3393.311,"You... you say that 204(g) prevents the plan at the outset from rendering itself amendable, but if you agreed with them that 204(g) does not prevent the later amendment, it would also be true that 204(g) does not prevent the employer from the outset at saying that the retirement benefits are amendable."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3394.038,3400.847,"--Justice Scalia, it allows an... you can make an amendment--"
2003.02-891,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.847,3413.357,"I was making the point earlier that even if we find for you, the employer would... would have a way of... of solving the problem, which is simply at the outset to set forth."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3433.048,3437.772,"--Well, it clearly prevents the later change, which is what is at issue here."
2003.02-891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3448.28,3455.96,"But another way of putting Justice Scalia's point is if they're right, it's surprising that they didn't make the point clearer in their plans because it would have been legal to do so."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3455.96,3461.283,"I don't think... they didn't make this argument below, to the best of my knowledge."
2003.02-891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.769,3473.915,"But I mean if their basic theory of the 204(g) is correct, then all the plans could have solved this problem by saying so expressly so nobody would have been fooled as your clients were."
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3486.175,3487.268,--Yes.
2003.02-891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.268,3488.775,They couldn't have done it if you're right and they're wrong.
2003.02-891,2,20907,david__m_gossett,,3488.775,3491.255,"That's exactly right, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.753,3528.322,"Thank you, Mr.... thank you, Mr. Gossett."

2003.02-891,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3592.778,3597.136,"No, but your plan could have made clear what you say the law otherwise authorizes."
2003.02-891,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3597.136,3609.729,"--It could have, although I would say that the provisions cited by the Assistant to the Solicitor General talks about telling a person who is in retirement about a material change in the suspension rules, and that's... that's pretty clear to my mind."
