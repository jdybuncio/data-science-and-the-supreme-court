2000.00-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"We'll hear argument this morning in number 00-836, George W. Bush vs. The Palm Beach County Canvassing Board."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,11.172,39.391,"And may it please the Court: Two weeks after the November 7 presidential election, the Florida Supreme Court overturned and materially rewrote portions of the carefully formulated set of laws enacted by Florida's legislature to govern the conduct of that election and the determination of controversies with respect to who prevailed on November 7th."
2000.00-836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.977,86.689,"Well, Mr. Olson, isn't Section 5 sort of a safe harbor provision for states, and do you think that it gives some independent right of a candidate to overturn a Florida decision based on that section?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,86.689,88.006,"We do, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.847,100.164,Yes.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,121.112,126.747,--That's why I've mentioned the context in which that section was adopted.
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.612,160.634,"Yeah, but what they did was, and it's typical of grant-in-aid programs, they said if you run a clean shop down there, we'll give you a bonus, and if you don't, well, you take your chances with everybody else."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,160.634,168.174,"--Justice Kennedy, I submit that it is much like a compact that Congress is offering in the form of Section 5, yes."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.051,199.878,But what is there in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida that indicates that it relied on this Federal statute in the reasoning for its decision and in its judgment?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,199.878,201.961,"Well, I think the fact is that it did not."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.362,243.388,"Well, we are looking for a Federal issue, and I thought that you might have argued that the Secretary of State was instructed by the Supreme Court not to jeopardize the state's chances and then cited 3 U.S.C. Sections 1 through 10."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,251.894,255.362,"--Well, I certainly agree that it mentioned those provisions."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.519,305.528,"Mr. Olson, suppose a less, a less controversial Federal benefit scheme, let's say the scheme that says states can get highway funds if, if they hold their highway speeds to a certain level, all right?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,330.113,330.83,"No, I don't think so."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.83,332.163,Why is this any different?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,332.163,343.67,"This is a great deal different because this is... first of all, Article II of the Constitution which vests authority to establish the rules exclusively in the legislatures of the state, tie in with Section 5."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.705,347.807,"Well, let's just talk about Section 5."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,354.545,371.84,"--I think it... I think it can't be divorced from Article II of the Constitution because it's a part of a plan for the vesting in the legislatures of a state, and Section 5 implements Article II in the sense that it provides a benefit not just to the state but to the voters."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.84,373.958,But just talk about the statutory issue.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,389.718,397.574,"Well, I think that the state did not pay, the state supreme court did not pay much attention to the Federal statute."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,400.776,403.176,"Well, then there is no Federal constitutional issue here."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,403.176,403.894,"--Well, there is a Federal--"
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.894,404.961,"Pardon me, statutory issue."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,404.961,411.565,"--Well, we believe that there is, Justice Kennedy, because although the state recognized it, it blew right past it."
2000.00-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.071,454.76,"Mr. Olson, do you think that Congress when it passed 3 U.S. Code, intended that there would be any judicial involvement?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,464.949,501.891,"I think that it was intend... directed to Congress, but it seems to me that in the context in which it was adopted and the promise that it afforded, that the conclusive effect would be given to the state selection of electors, that is a somewhat empty remedy and it doesn't accomplish Congress' objectives if it cannot be enforced when an agency of the state government steps in as the Florida Supreme Court did here and overturn the plan by which the Florida legislature carefully set forth a program so that disputes could be resolved, and we wouldn't have the controversy, conflict and chaos that we submit exists today in Florida."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.891,508.045,"Mr. Olson, your... your submission is based on the premise that the Florida court overturned something that the statute did not."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,513.799,517.751,"Justice Stevens, I don't think that in this case that's even remotely arguable."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.571,524.005,Yes.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,530.577,531.044,--No.
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.866,542.384,Correct.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,542.384,549.055,"Both of those statutes, both of those provisions say that the returns must be, or shall be filed by a certain deadline."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.331,575.103,Does that mean if there were an act of God that prevented the returns from being filed that she would have discretion either to accept or reject the returns?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,575.103,576.288,"Yes, I believe--"
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.288,577.705,She would have the discretion?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,577.705,578.355,--Yes.
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.355,581.174,Would she be compelled in that event to accept the returns?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,581.174,582.709,I don't think so.
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.876,586.994,She has the total discretion either to accept or reject?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,586.994,588.03,--That's--
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,588.03,592.732,Is there any circumstance in which she would be compelled to accept a late return?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,592.732,594.6,--I don't know of any.
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.386,598.819,"Well, you are arguing in effect that it's a mandatory deadline."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,600.588,608.843,"Well, the problem is that it's... what we are saying is that either it's mandatory, in which case she could not accept them."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.843,610.76,But you don't know whether it's mandatory or not?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,610.76,620.834,"Well, the Florida Supreme Court and what the circuit court did in that case, it said that it wasn't... and we'll accept this for purposes of this argument that it wasn't--"
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.834,626.302,"Yes, but one of the things that's of interest to me is the extent to which you say there was a change in the law."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,633.725,640.396,"--I think that we can answer that this way, is that whether it was shall ignore or may ignore."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.498,644.7,Under any circumstance it was not must?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,644.7,647.902,"No, under no circumstances was it must accept."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.568,650.436,Even in an act of God or fraud?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,650.436,652.136,"--I don't believe so, Justice Stevens."
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.136,652.619,Okay.
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.619,653.305,Mr.--
2000.00-836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,653.305,665.863,"--Isn't the law in Florida like as in most states, and in the Federal government, that when an official has discretion, may accept or may not accept, that has to be exercised within the limits of reason?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,665.863,666.479,Yes.
2000.00-836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.479,682.306,"Well, then, isn't it possible that when the court says she must accept under certain circumstances, what they mean is outside those circumstances, given the circumstances here it would be unreasonable to refuse?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,682.306,687.877,"Well, what the court did was so constrain those circumstances, virtually to make them nonexistent."
2000.00-836,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.877,688.193,All right.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,701.119,722.05,"I think that... yes, but I think that it has to be looked at in the context in which that was done when the state supreme court so constrained and says in its opinion shall accept these late returns until 5 p.m. on November 26th, and in the context there was no discretion left for the Secretary of State at all."
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.05,731.639,"Mr. Olson, may I ask you, because you've been skipping over what I thought was a key piece of the Florida legislation."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,759.991,761.858,Up to.
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.858,763.21,"Yeah, up to."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,805.704,813.542,"The first part of the recount provision to which you're referring, Justice Ginsburg, says may conduct a recount."
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.306,887.774,But that's something that one can certainly argue.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,919.229,928.168,"--This is a very unusual situation, Justice Ginsburg, because it is in the context of a presidential election, and it is in the context of Federal rights."
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.325,955.068,"But I said, and even in the very cases that you cite, because I checked them, that we owe the highest respect to the state court when it says what the state law is."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,955.068,969.162,"--Yes, but then the Court has also said, then we go on to see the extent to which what the state court did, as we cited in the Lindsey case, for example, in the ex post facto context, we go on to see what the import of that is in connection with the Federal right."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,978.017,985.687,Does the Secretary have any flexibility to accommodate the statute to the exigencies of the presidential election?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,987.973,989.523,The Secretary of State did.
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.436,1045.609,"Mr. Olson, on the equitable powers, they were doing that in setting a new deadline, and I don't think you would argue the case would have been more acceptable if there had been no deadline?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1045.609,1047.126,"No, it wouldn't have been, but--"
2000.00-836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.126,1055.815,"And on the fight between may and shall, they relied on four traditional canons of statutory construction and not equity at all."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1055.815,1072.943,"--They recited four canons of statutory construction, Justice Stevens, but when they said they use those construction... canons of statutory construction to say that the words may and shall mean shall not, that is not a reasonable exercise of statutory construction."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.785,1090.572,"I don't read their opinion that way, Mr. Olson."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1113.218,1122.424,"Well, yes, I agree with that up to a point, but then it says that she must accept these returns that are after the deadline."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.424,1126.061,That was not on the basis of any canons of statutory construction.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1128.461,1143.421,"That's right, but... so there was both going on, and what the court was bound and determined to do was to get to a consequence that the court determined was consistent with the will of the people, irrespective of what the statute--"
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1143.421,1190.318,"Mr. Olson, would you agree that when we read a state court decision, we should read it in the light most favorable to the integrity of the state supreme court, that if there are two possible readings, one that would impute to that court in judicial behavior, lack of integrity, indeed dishonesty, and the other one that would read the opinion to say we think this court is attempting to construe the state law... it may have been wrong, we might have interpreted it differently, but we are not the arbiters, they are."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1190.318,1191.754,--I would like to answer that in two ways.
2000.00-836,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.083,1217.571,"But if it tells us... if it tells us, we see these two provisions in conflict, they need to be reconciled."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1217.571,1237.699,"--But... under almost any other circumstances, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but in this context, in this context, we are talking about a Federal right, a Federal constitutional right, and the rights of individual citizens under the Constitution and so therefore, this Court has a grave responsibility to look--"
2000.00-836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1237.699,1243.853,"Mr. Olson, I'd like to get focused a little more on this same area."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1260.981,1261.548,--Yes.
2000.00-836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.548,1265.218,And are you relying in that regard on Title 2?
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1274.491,1278.026,"Well, we are very definitely relying on Article II of the Constitution."
2000.00-836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.994,1338.414,"And the state legislature could vest it in the judiciary if it wanted, as I read the McPherson case, and here they have done something less."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1349.056,1351.674,"Well, it is... yes, it said that, Justice Kennedy."
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1362.716,1363.132,All right.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1487.797,1496.735,"Because I submit that that writes Section 5 essentially out of existence if an agency of state government, if a state legislature--"
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1496.735,1497.235,No.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1506.574,1530.207,"--If the state agency, if the state legislature empowered by Article II of the Constitution, does what it is invited to do by Section 5, and then another agency of state government, in this case the state supreme court, comes along and upsets that scheme, yes, you have ultimate resort to the resolution of the dispute under Sections 15 of Title 3, but that's precisely--"
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1530.207,1532.225,"Well, you say you have ultimate resort."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1538.962,1556.174,"--Well, I'm not making myself clear, I think, is that the importance of Section 5 was to invite the state to do things that would avoid the chaos and the conflict and the controversy and the unsettled situation that this country faced in 1876, and--"
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.174,1560.245,"Mr. Olson, did Section 15 exist when McPherson was decided?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1560.245,1564.197,"--I don't know, Justice Scalia."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.52,1578.539,"That would make a difference, wouldn't it?"
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1578.539,1581.241,"--Well, it seems to me it wouldn't make a difference, because of this."
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1602.238,1607.476,"Well, but Section 15 assumes that there is controversy and chaos."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1607.476,1607.809,--Yes.
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.809,1614.212,Section 15 isn't providing for challenges except in situations perhaps exactly like this one.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1614.212,1628.472,"But that's what the country... what essentially Section 15, although it modifies it and structures it somewhat, it was still a situation that Congress was facing in 1876 when it was dealing with the Hayes-Tilden election."
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1628.472,1628.872,Right.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1628.872,1639.328,"And by the time it got there, there were dueling slates of electors that were buying... there were exchanges and a lot of things that everyone felt was very destructive to the country."
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.328,1650.153,"But Congress had to face the constitutional fact that under Article II, it could not, or its understanding was certainly, that it could not mandate certain state procedures."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1654.087,1654.872,Correct.
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.872,1677.386,"So the most that Congress could do in providing for a more orderly resolution of what happened in Hayes-Tilden was to do what it did in Section 5, and that is to say if you do certain things, you can depend upon the results, recognizing that the state might not do those things."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1711.023,1718.713,"I think that's a very important point, and let me make it: That Congress did say if you do these things, certain consequences will flow from it."
2000.00-836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.037,1737.591,We have to separate your statutory argument from your Constitutional argument.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1750.748,1752.367,"--No, I don't think so."

2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1786.858,1793.262,"That's not a fair reading of Section 5, and let me answer this question, and I would like with the Court's permission to reserve the time--"
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1793.262,1795.796,"Well, I don't think Section 5 goes to the issue."
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1798.831,1800.748,--I don't think that they can be read in isolation.
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.675,1816.96,"And in 1876, Congress did not have--"
2000.00-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.96,1818.26,--1877.
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1818.26,1820.579,--the rules with--
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1820.579,1821.262,--1877.
2000.00-836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1821.262,1827.666,Congress did not have the rules with respect to conclusiveness that it now has under Section 5.
2000.00-836,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1827.666,1828.185,That's right.
2000.00-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.502,1855.268,"Very well, Mr. Olson."
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1857.537,1872.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.179,1909.303,"Does the Secretary maintain that in some instances she has a discretion that a court does not or can a court do whatever she might do, under Florida law?"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1909.303,1928.466,"Under Florida law, she has certain discretion that I think a court probably does not have in the protest period, Justice Kennedy, and that would be that she had the discretion to decide whether or not returns could be permitted after that seventh day, and indeed that's based on two things that we have in the record."
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.545,1999.396,She said she would exercise her discretion.
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2002.948,2005.216,--I think she would have to exercise her discretion.
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.216,2006.5,The court could compel her to?
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2006.5,2006.983,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.983,2010.602,Do you think that was clear before the opinion of the supreme court in this case?
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2010.602,2011.12,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.12,2015.739,Let me just ask one general question for your comment on whether it's a change in the law.
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2026.38,2029.416,In terms of handing down its decision?
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.416,2031.701,In terms of the particular result it reached in this case.
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2031.701,2042.139,I believe the Supreme Court of Florida was looking at its law in terms of articulating the law that it wanted to have then and on a going-forward basis.
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.697,2061.637,Do you think they thought their decision was dictated either by prior precedent or by the constitution of the state?
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2061.637,2066.438,"--Your Honor, I don't know whether they thought that or not, but that's not what the opinion says."
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.179,2131.131,I understand your position is that was entirely new?
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2131.131,2131.697,"--Yes, sir."
2000.00-836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.697,2138.47,"I'm just wondering, therefore your submission is that it was not dictated by the constitution or by prior precedent?"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2138.47,2139.12,"No, Your Honor."
2000.00-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.12,2145.307,"I thought you said a moment ago that the court, the Florida court did rely on the Florida Constitution."
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2147.659,2163.252,"Your Honor, in devising the remedy, they refer to the Florida Constitution, but the issue that we're here on, as I understand it, sir, is whether or not the law changed."
2000.00-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.82,2179.547,"I think perhaps another statement of the issue is to what extent did the Florida Supreme Court, in construing this statute, rely on more general provisions of the Florida Constitution which they cited in their opinion?"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2179.547,2205.329,"--I think they did rely, in creating the remedy on the Florida Constitution, I believe they created a right that had not previously been seen there, which they have a right to do, but, Mr. Chief Justice, the issue again is whether or not the law that they articulated on November 21 is different than the law that existed on November 7, and how the Secretary of State, in exercising her discretion, was to divine the standard that would be established on November 21."
2000.00-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.329,2216.137,"Your position is so long as it's different, it violates Section 5 and therefore we have a right to step in?"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2216.137,2221.457,"Well, Justice Scalia, we have not addressed the Federal issues because, I mean, we're in a situation where you have--"
2000.00-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.457,2223.807,"Well, this is a Federal court what are you here for, if you're not addressing--"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2223.807,2224.223,"--I understand that, sir."
2000.00-836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.448,2267.067,"--Can you tell me when this petition was filed here, the Secretary had not certified anybody the winner, and now the Secretary has certified a winner, and therefore, I guess, whether we win, whether your side, the side you're supporting wins or loses, it doesn't change that, and I guess that's moot, but my question is, is there any respect in which this really makes a difference, this case?"
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2280.577,2297.419,"Your Honor, it makes an enormous difference because the relief that has been requested would be for the Court to determine that the law in effect at the time of the election was that manual recounting of ballots would not be permitted to address voter error, which I think has been extensively--"
2000.00-836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.419,2309.846,"We don't have... all... suppose they won and the relief was, suppose your side won, and the relief was, fine, it should have been certified on November 14th or 18th instead of November 26th."
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2326.173,2339.015,"--The only immediate result would be that you would have a margin that instead of being 536 votes would be 900-some-odd votes, and it would only be added to as a result of whatever was added by the overseas ballots."
2000.00-836,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.015,2339.682,Fine.
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2359.679,2385.894,"It will make a difference to the outcome of the election because there is an ongoing contest which is interrelated and is involved with the Supreme Court's opinion, and of course because the Supreme Court of Florida, in coming up with the remedy that they came up with, completely changed the period of time from a relatively short period of time, seven days for a protest and much longer period for a contest, we now have a situation where there is 19 days for the protest and 16 days for a contest."
2000.00-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.894,2388.763,"Well, it's too late... it's too late to lengthen the time for the contest."
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2393.917,2396.352,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but the issue here... I'm sorry."
2000.00-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.352,2416.598,"Is it not the case that if the votes are, are as, as they have been shown to be under the Florida Supreme Court's opinion, the race is much closer, and therefore some counties under Florida law would conduct recounts that otherwise would not conduct recounts."
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2422.669,2443.916,"Your Honor, if the law is returned to the point it was on November 7, there is no right to a manual recount to correct voter error, and that will end the litigation that currently exists in the State of Florida, which were the opinions of the Secretary of State's Division of Elections that were issued and also the state of the law as it existed at that point in time."
2000.00-836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.317,2473.685,The secretary took the... never mind.
2000.00-836,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2473.685,2474.385,Thank you.
2000.00-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.385,2476.404,"Thank you, Mr. Klock."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2478.089,2497.484,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In accordance with Article II of the United States Constitution, the Florida legislature has directed the manner of selecting presidential electors in Florida."
2000.00-836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2505.823,2513.846,I guess Article II permits the legislature in general to make a choice that it could itself select the electors?
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2513.846,2514.996,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.721,2574.9,"In your brief you say, you conclude that the Florida Supreme Court like, I think it's page 12, like any state court, exercised its inherent equitable powers to remedy a threat to fundamental constitutional rights, and it rewrote the certification deadlines according to that power, did it not?"
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2574.9,2577.002,"The only... yes, Justice Kennedy."
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2581.74,2594.814,Isn't that such an amorphous general abstract standing that it can't possibly be said to be a law that was enacted and in place at the time of the election?
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2594.814,2595.464,No.
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2601.085,2614.477,"Of course, the Constitution was there before the election, the Due Process Clause is before the election, but what we are talking about is having laws of sufficient specificity and stability that people can rely on them in advance and not have them changed after the fact."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2637.41,2640.362,"--The court had to do something, Justice Kennedy."
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.035,2656.304,"Maybe it had to do something, but did it comply with 3 U.S.C. Section 5?"
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2656.304,2663.644,"--I submit, Justice Kennedy, that 3 U.S.C. Section 5 doesn't require the state to do anything, it merely says--"
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.644,2672.666,But did it comply with that part of 3 U.S.C. Section 5 that requires that laws be enacted and in place prior to the election in order to get the safe harbor?
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2672.666,2673.8,"--Yes, it did."
2000.00-836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2679.67,2682.372,"Well, but certainly the date changed."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2687.26,2687.626,--Yes.
2000.00-836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2687.626,2688.676,And it was done by the court.
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2688.676,2689.843,"Yes, it was done pursuant--"
2000.00-836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2689.843,2718.879,"And the legislature had very clearly said, you know, seven days after, that's the date, and it just does look like a very dramatic change made by the Florida court, and I'm wondering if that is consistent in fact with the notion, expressed at least in Section 5, so that the result would be if it did go to Congress, it would be a change."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2718.879,2725.718,--The... I agree that the date was implemented pursuant to the court's equitable powers.
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.596,2746.298,Yes.
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2805.92,2806.987,"No, Justice--"
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.987,2807.52,Did that ever happen--
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2807.52,2809.122,"--No, I'm not aware of it ever happening before."
2000.00-836,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.302,2838.891,--Is it your position that any interpretation the Supreme Court of Florida makes to implement the will of the people is never a new law?
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2838.891,2842.676,--The supreme... yes.
2000.00-836,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.904,2882.92,"Mr. Hancock, are you relying on the Florida Supreme Court statement at least twice in its opinion... now I looked at the page to which Mr. Klock referred, page 37-A, it says for the second time that Section, the section governing manual recounts appears to conflict with the sections that set a deadline, and it's reconciling that conflict."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2882.92,2883.32,Yes.
2000.00-836,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.32,2888.741,"Whether it was wrong or right, that's what it said its mission was and that's what it did."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2888.741,2889.174,Yes.
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.929,2900.429,What is the section that requires manual recounts?
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2900.429,2901.881,--It's 102.
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.499,2908.535,That's different from requires.
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2908.535,2916.991,"Yes, but once it starts, Justice Scalia, once it's authorized, if the initial sample recount shows an error that might effect the outcome of the election--"
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.991,2917.524,Then--
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2917.524,2922.242,"--The board is then required to, among other things, conduct a full manual recount."
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.242,2922.692,"--No, no."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2931.598,2932.284,Yes.
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.75,2942.739,"So there is really... there is... I mean, the Court says that there is a requirement for a manual recount but I don't see anything in the text of the statute that requires a manual recount."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2942.739,2948.376,--The statute requires that the election officials attempt to discern the cause of the error.
2000.00-836,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2978.246,2984.466,"It says that the board may authorize the manual recount, it doesn't require it."
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,2996.79,3016.788,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, but, again these... under the law these requests can be made up to the time of canvassing... that means up to six or seven days... and also the number of ballots at issue here are between 650,000 in Palm Beach County and also 900,000, up to 900,000 in Broward County."
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.788,3023.691,"If that is a statutory problem, the court's resolution didn't really solve it, did it?"
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,3036.684,3038.719,"Well, let me--"
2000.00-836,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.719,3051.361,I mean to resolve a supposed conflict in the statute in a manner that leaves in place the same problem that existed before seems to me not a real resolution of the statutory problem.
2000.00-836,2,37998,paul_hancock,,3051.361,3058.365,"--The supreme court tried to blend it all together to make it work, Justice Scalia, and again it came up with a solution."

2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.519,3329.791,"Let me just ask you a moment, you say you don't think the statute permits this Court to get into the matter at this time."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3336.928,3343.515,"No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, it's just that I don't trust my own imagination to have exhausted all possibilities."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.768,3372.584,"No, it certainly was quite different from--"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3372.584,3373.168,Very.
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.168,3374.22,--this hypothetical.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3374.22,3375.053,That's certainly right.
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3375.053,3393.615,"You suggest in your reply brief that it is not... I think you said it's not self-evident that the Florida legislature at this time has the right to appoint any slate of delegates because the Congress has set the date, and the date is the general election day."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3424.986,3438.294,"Well, Justice Kennedy, first of all I do want to be clear that in our view the question of whether and when and how the Florida legislature can enter the picture is in no way presented here."
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3475.836,3483.608,"And my point is that puts hydraulic pressure on your nonjusticiability argument and makes it a very, very important argument and a critical argument in this case."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3483.608,3489.929,"Well, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but I frankly can't see how it would affect the decision in this case."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3514.461,3537.826,"Well, I guess in the area, though, of presidential electors it could be that that court, as all courts would be, have to be informed, at least, by the provisions of Section 5 in reviewing the laws enacted by the legislature of the state."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3551.086,3566.512,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly agree that if the Florida Supreme Court adverted to 3 U.S.C. Section 5, and as Justice Kennedy asked earlier, got it wrong, then there would be a Federal issue for this Court."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3567.979,3571.314,"Well, is there a Federal issue if the Court doesn't--"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3571.314,3571.849,--No.
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3572.716,3573.365,--advert to that?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3573.365,3574.1,It would be nice.
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3575.034,3596.448,"Because of Article II, which, after all, does give the legislature plenary power and must have wanted... it must have wanted to have the laws in place so that it wasn't... so that Florida wouldn't risk losing its electoral votes."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3609.958,3624.734,"--But, Justice O'Connor, under Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, the authority to regulate the manner of the choice of electors is vested in the state legislature."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3644.029,3645.548,"Well, it certainly did by enacting that date."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3649.416,3669.829,"--Well, I suppose it could be a violation of Florida law if the enactment of that date is construed as a direction to a particular authority like the secretary of state or the state's highest court to take certain actions in order to get the benefit of this bonus, but only a violation of Federal law."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3670.679,3671.865,What Florida law would that be?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3671.865,3672.298,--Of state law.
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3672.831,3675.233,Are you talking about the Florida Constitution?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3675.233,3676.8,"Well, it might have been a violation--"
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3676.8,3678.952,But then you run into the Blacker case.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3678.952,3696.23,"--But it seems to me that the Federal question, which is really what brings us here, can only arise if 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is something other than what Mr. Olson called the indemnification of the state."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3696.23,3700.348,It can also arise under the section of the Constitution that was construed in Blacker.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3703.634,3714.108,"That's right, if one concluded that Florida had violated its duty to empower the legislature to take these regulatory steps."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3714.108,3724.148,If one concluded that the Florida legislature had relied on the state constitution in a way that the Blacker case says it may not in construing the statute.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3724.148,3735.021,"I think that's possible, Mr. Chief Justice, but the judgment before you doesn't provide even an inkling, I think of proof about those matters."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3735.872,3738.472,That's what we have been arguing--
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3740.073,3743.025,"--Well, I think we have been arguing several interrelated things."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3779.131,3779.415,No.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3798.945,3802.914,"Well, that they can never advert to their own constitution?"
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3802.914,3809.67,"Well, certainly it stands for the proposition you couldn't do it then, in those circumstances."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3809.67,3833.166,"Well, what would it be, I wonder, about the circumstances here that would say that in reconciling these provisions which at first we were told were mandatory, then we were told they are not mandatory, they give discretion, and now we are told that the real issue is simply did the court in putting a boundary on that discretion, do something federally impermissible."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3836.237,3848.561,"Well, you know, if the Supreme Court of Florida simply said in its opinion, look, these sections of the statute conflict, we've got to under our judicial principles resolve it one way or the other, but... but it doesn't say that."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3856.365,3869.874,"--It seems to me that as a tiebreaker, as a way of shedding light on the provisions that are in conflict, so long as it's not done in a way that conflicts with a Federal mandate, they are not violating any--"
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3869.874,3873.076,"Mr. Tribe, I don't... I don't agree with that."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4002.228,4010.567,--It seems to me that it's already been conceded that the legislature can delegate that function to the judiciary.
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4040.086,4041.67,Isn't there another... go on.
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4041.67,4042.086,No.
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4042.57,4072.289,"Isn't there another way of looking at what the Florida court did, and that was in effect to apply the statute, the interpretative criterion, that where there is any discretion for interpretation, an unconstitutional result should be avoided, and because you have here a statute as I understand it that regulates both Federal and state recounts, that much is, I think is clear."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4072.289,4072.641,Right.
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4072.641,4100.125,"The only way to avoid an unconstitutional meaning of the statute so far as Florida law was concerned was to get into this constitutional concern about preserving the franchise, and that because the legislature intended one standard to cover both Federal and state recounts, it therefore is valid to consider the state constitution in order to derive a general meaning that will apply to a Federal, as well as a state election."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4102.26,4104.694,"I fully accept that view, Justice Souter."
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4135.295,4138.83,Can you... can you just go back to your characterization of the opinion.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4149.604,4150.071,That's right.
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4150.071,4158.661,"--All right, but thinking of this opinion, suppose the court had said, look, we reach our result based on the canons we found in Blackstone."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4163.715,4165.081,I think that makes sense.
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4165.081,4165.43,All right.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4183.109,4184.044,It might be different.
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4184.044,4185.678,"Now, what is it that they have done here?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4185.678,4188.095,I certainly don't think they have done the third.
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4204.875,4209.427,"It's in a separate section of the opinion, Professor Tribe, that is entitled the right to vote."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4240.648,4241.615,--Justice Scalia--
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4241.615,4243.417,--that was explicitly set forth in the constitution.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4243.417,4262.144,"--Justice Scalia, both you and I think at one point Justice O'Connor, in pointing to the particular dates that came out differently under the approach that this Court used from what would have emerged if they had looked only at 102.111 are making a mistake, with all respect."
2000.00-836,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4297.567,4298.217,Professor Tribe--
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4298.217,4299.169,--in such a way that--
2000.00-836,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4299.169,4312.744,"--Isn't it also true, Professor Tribe, that part 8 of the opinion relies on four things... the Florida Constitution, earlier Florida decisions construing statutes, an Illinois case, and a Federal case."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4312.744,4313.477,--Absolutely.
2000.00-836,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4313.477,4314.863,Not just their constitution.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4314.863,4316.096,"That's right, and surely--"
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4316.096,4343.948,"Is it also true that the inability to use Section 7 depended in the Florida Supreme Court's reasoning not on the existence of the constitution as the sole reason, but on the inability to make the December 7 date final and provide for the recounts within the times in which recounts can be called for."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4357.19,4357.875,--Exactly.
2000.00-836,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4359.725,4377.353,"They said that twice, and I think that's critical if you add to that that we read a decision of a state court in the light most favorable to that court and not in the light least favorable."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4392.013,4404.904,"--Especially, I think, Justice Ginsburg, when the odds that these conceivable Federal problems are indispensable to this result, are overwhelmingly negative."
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4414.294,4437.994,"--Professor Tribe, I would feel much better about the resolution if you could give me one sentence in the opinion that supports the second of these supposed alternative readings, that supports the proposition that the Florida Supreme Court was using the constitutional right to vote provisions as an interpretive tool to determine what the statute meant."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4439.71,4442.879,"--Justice Scalia, I can do a little better than find a sentence."
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4458.157,4472.481,"You would bother with it because having decided very clearly what the statute requires and finding no way to get around the firm dates set, you say the reason it's bad is because of the state constitution."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4473.333,4474.3,"But, Justice Scalia--"
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4474.3,4477.369,"They might have tried it another way, but it seems to me they didn't--"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4477.369,4507.138,"--They also say that the provision that reaches the result that conflicts with the authorized recounts was written in 1951, that in 1989 they wrote a provision that unmistakably created discretion, and we haven't yet discussed this provision, also created the provision that when the returns are filed late, it doesn't say throw them away, it doesn't say give them back, it says fine every member of the canvassing board $200 a day."
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4533.789,4536.072,--What is the November 26th date?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4558.921,4566.51,"Well, it looks to me like an exercise of the chancellor's foot, as it were, in this particular case."
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4598.831,4599.664,If the legislature--
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4599.664,4600.331,--in the pauper's will.
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4602.516,4610.539,"--And if the legislature had jumped into the breach and said this same thing, would that be a new statute or new enactment under 5 U.S.C.?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4610.539,4647.395,"I... honestly, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure because the language that I quoted from 3 U.S.C. Section 5 focuses on the institutional dispute resolution arrangement that is in place, and if you look at the legislative history in the decade of hearings in the period after the Hayes-Tilden debacle, that history focused on the importance of having a fixed tribunal which you could look to rather than one cooked up at the last moment, and indeed what they seem to be most afraid of was the political entry of legislators and executives at the 11th hour."
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4649.164,4656.001,"But are you saying you can't tell us whether they, in the hypothetical, supposed that it would be a new enactment?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4656.001,4657.77,"Well, there are certainly no cases on the subject."
2000.00-836,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4667.975,4673.212,You don't think you could tell us what you might advise the Congress if you were the counsel for the Judiciary Committee.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4673.212,4689.907,"--I think I would advise the Congress that it is not a new enactment, that it is an entirely reasonable construction of an existing enactment as to which the only alternative construction is to make it self-destruct, and to make it internally contradictory, and I honestly don't think if I were advising Congress that I would say it's a new construction."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4731.484,4744.625,"There should perhaps be some deference, though, to the concept expressed in Article II, that it is the authority of the legislature and some special concern about what the legislature may have said."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4744.625,4764.288,"Yes, but if the legislature is entirely happy not to completely delegate this power to the courts, which Article II would permit, but rather to allow the courts to exercise a somewhat more flexible role than the one that the critic of this opinion would be embracing."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4766.907,4774.394,"Yeah, but who would have thought that the legislature was leaving open the date for change by the court?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4775.344,4775.679,Anyone.
2000.00-836,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4783.267,4785.119,That doesn't change... that's not the date.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4785.119,4787.737,"No, the date is the one from which the may is measured."
2000.00-836,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4811.519,4825.51,"Yes, well, then the Secretary came in and argued and said, yes, her discretion was if it were an act of God or a machine breakdown she would exercise her discretion."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4825.51,4833.183,--And it's an entirely normal exercise of judicial interpretation to say that this statute is not limited to God and machines.
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4833.183,4845.757,"Professor Tribe, can I ask you why you think the Florida legislature delegated to the Florida Supreme Court the authority to interpose the Florida Constitution?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4865.487,4868.706,"Well, I have to say my experience parallels that--"
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4868.706,4873.443,What makes you think the Florida legislature affirmatively invited the Florida Supreme Court?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4873.443,4895.84,"--The odd thing is that the system in Florida involves their own repromulgation of the constitution, and their scheme with respect to the resolution of disputes over elections draws a sharp distinction between elections to their own House and Senate, which they won't trust the courts with as far as they can throw them."
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4905.648,4917.206,"They are resigned, that they are resigned to, but they need not be resigned to the Florida Supreme Court interposing itself with respect to Federal elections, they need not be because the Florida Constitution cannot affect it."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4931.446,4959.033,"Well, I suppose if they were at all far-sighted, if they looked at their own work and saw how self-contradictory it was, they might say we would want someone with the authority to reconcile these provisions to do so in the light not only of the literal language but of the fact that they are dealing with something very important, the franchise, that disenfranchising people, which is what this is all about, disenfranchising people isn't very nice."
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4959.033,4959.899,Wouldn't justice--
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4959.899,4962.335,And it violates the Federal as well as the state Constitution.
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4962.335,4976.142,--But wouldn't Justice Scalia's suggestion be a stronger suggestion if they had dealt by the statute only with Federal elections or only with a presidential election as opposed to dealing with both state and Federal in the same statute?
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,4976.142,4987.516,"Well, it's not uncommon, given the convenience of having similar regulations apply on election day not to bifurcate."
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4992.42,4992.837,Right.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5024.575,5043.437,"--And they would recognize that when the Federal election involved the presidency of the United States with the special problems of the Electoral College deadline, they might emerge with rather different deadlines and to some extent a different approach for the... two elections."
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5043.437,5050.091,"But there are already different deadlines for Federal elections, aren't there, because of the Federal statute concerning overseas ballots?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5050.091,5050.507,Yes.
2000.00-836,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5052.157,5052.959,"So that's, that's going to be different anyway."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5052.959,5054.576,And there is an administrative order--
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5054.576,5056.695,"But it's as a result of Federal law, isn't it?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5056.695,5060.047,"--Well, there is a consent decree arising out of Federal law."
2000.00-836,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5062.499,5064.7,"But it wasn't the legislature's choice, it was Congress' choice that required that."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5064.7,5065.133,--That's right.
2000.00-836,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5069.402,5076.889,"Mr. Tribe, before you finish, I would like to know whether you are conceding some of the things you said."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5102.623,5102.989,No.
2000.00-836,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5126.403,5126.737,No.
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5144.596,5146.965,"I'm not actually clear about that, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.00-836,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5191.326,5203.134,"Well, could the state legislature at least now say in light of all this confusion, we enact a law today saying this is the way electors will be selected?"
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5205.753,5207.103,I'm not sure.
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5222.715,5224.182,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
2000.00-836,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,5224.182,5226.267,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.00-836,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5226.267,5228.434,"Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining."
2000.00-836,4,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5228.434,5233.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.00-836,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5265.309,5274.064,"But suppose they refer to the declaration of the rights of man, to 1789, the French revolution, I mean, the right to vote is a value in the constitution."
2000.00-836,4,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5276.432,5277.116,--They are saying--
2000.00-836,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5277.116,5283.253,"Or are they are saying the statute means one thing, but the statute is unconstitutional because the Constitution of Florida says the opposite."
2000.00-836,4,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5284.136,5303.167,"--I think that the only reasonable fair reading of the decision is that the Florida Supreme Court felt that, and it says it over and over again, that we are going to be... attempt to discern the will of the people, the will of the electorate and discern, and enhance in whatever way we possibly can the right to vote."
2000.00-836,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5463.987,5474.462,"As I look in the conclusion, the paragraph on page 37-A, where they summarize what they said, there is nothing there about the Florida Constitution."
2000.00-836,4,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5493.94,5498.41,The very second paragraph refers to the Florida Constitution and the rights to vote.
2000.00-836,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5502.546,5503.662,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
