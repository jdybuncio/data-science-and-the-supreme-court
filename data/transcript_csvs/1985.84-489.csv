1985.84-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.638,We will hear arguments first this morning in Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction against the United States Marshals Service.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,17.635,20.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.566,217.313,"General Zimmerman, as I understand it, the state does not contest that part of the magistrate's order which required transportation from a correctional facility to Philadelphia."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,217.313,218.734,"--That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.734,226.794,"And, the government doesn't challenge that part of the Court of Appeals' decision which required the furnishing of security within the Federal Courthouse?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,226.794,228.809,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.809,234.853,"So, what we are talking about is transportation from the State Correctional Center in Philadelphia to the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,234.853,235.103,Yes.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,239.055,241.898,Do you have a Federal House of Detention in Philadelphia?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,241.898,242.945,--I beg your pardon?
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,242.945,249.114,Do you have a Federal House of... Do you have any place where federal prisoners are kept in Philadelphia?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,249.114,250.192,No.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,260.689,273.48,"So, what this ruling says is that they can pick up their own prisoners and transfer them, but they don't have to pick up these from the exact same place?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,273.48,290.787,"This ruling... The magistrate, in fashioning this ruling, Justice Marshall, said that because they regularly... in considering this, because the Marshals regularly went back and forth, that it was not a burden on them to transport state prisoners to Federal Court in civil rights actions."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.787,298.535,"General, I don't suppose your submission would be limited to that fortuitous circumstance."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,298.535,300.08,"No, Justice White."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.08,314.886,"You would think any time in the 1983 action the Federal Marshals should be required to bring the plaintiff, if he is a prisoner, and witnesses from the prison, furnish any of that transportation."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,314.886,319.495,"Justice White, so long as it is not an inordinate burden on the Federal Marshals."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.132,343.766,"If it is a question of authority, why, if they have authority or if they are obligated to do this under the law, it wouldn't make any difference what the burden is, would it?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,343.766,345.016,--No.
1985.84-489,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,349.109,351.702,"Mr. Attorney General, refresh my recollection."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,354.997,359.543,--Five miles from the House of Detention in Philadelphia to the Federal Courthouse.
1985.84-489,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,359.543,360.637,"And, you mentioned burden."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,368.322,373.679,"Well, Justice Powell, I don't think that the question of burden is in this particular case."
1985.84-489,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,392.656,394.421,"And, that would apply to the 50 miles?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,394.421,394.952,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.716,422.628,"General Zimmerman, suppose that you are somehow correct that the All Writs Act could encompass such a power on the part of the Federal Court to order this transportation, what requirements would you then think a judge or magistrate would have to find in order to justify such an order?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,439.857,444.075,"--Justice O'Connor, I don't think that this is a question solely of money."
1985.84-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.614,476.406,What requirements do you think would have to be met under the All Writs Act if your position about it is valid--
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,476.406,477.312,"Well, I believe--"
1985.84-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.312,479.155,--to justify such an order?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,491.947,498.539,"--In this particular case... It is not our argument that it is necessary, but I do believe that the Act... Of course, the Act says,"
1985.84-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.965,530.713,It is a burden on both the federal and state agencies to have to do this.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,539.366,557.359,"--As we argue, if the All Writs Act is the source of the Court's power, and I believe that it is here, then, of course, there will be a question in each of the cases, a matter of discretion of the magistrate to exercise discretion, whether or not he has acted correctly in looking at the burden of producing a witness."
1985.84-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.196,590.739,"In this case, does the state take the position that it would not have obeyed an ad testificandum order to have the prisoner transported?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,590.739,594.003,"No, it does not take that position, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,658.307,663.821,"General, if this action were in state court, and it could have been there, could it not?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,663.821,664.665,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,664.665,666.007,Then we would have no problem at all.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,666.007,668.569,"Well, the state court--"
1985.84-489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,668.569,670.896,I take it the U.S. Marshals would not be involved.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,670.896,672.004,--That is correct.
1985.84-489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,672.004,674.8,"So, the expense would be that of the Commonwealth."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,674.8,675.769,It would be.
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.606,721.034,"General, pursuing Justice Blackmun's question another step, if this had been in the state court and the plaintiff was not an indigent... He was in prison, but he wanted witnesses from the state prison, wouldn't you make him pay the witness fees and wouldn't you make him pay the transportation?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,721.034,729.72,"No, Justice White, he would not be required... If the witnesses were in prison, he would not be required to pay those."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,729.72,733.435,Even though the plaintiff is not an indigent?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,733.435,737.762,"Well, if he is an indigent--"
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.762,738.902,"Well, I said--"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,738.902,740.136,--he would not be required to pay.
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,745.633,755.348,"--And, in this case then, if this person were not an indigent, wouldn't he have to pay?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,755.348,759.394,In the case of a state prisoner here in this case?
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.095,765.813,Okay.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,774.621,780.806,The arrangement is entered into between the Marshals Service and the Philadelphia County House of Detention.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.806,786.024,"I am talking about in a case like this, this prisoner here."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,789.975,798.877,The arrangement there is between Philadelphia and the U.S. Marshals in this case.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,810.716,814.371,"Well, suppose the case lasted more than one day."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,817.823,824.196,A state prisoner would be returned to the place in Philadelphia called Greaterford which is the State Penitentiary there.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,828.474,830.754,Then the state would pay his expenses?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,830.754,831.176,That is correct.
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.176,836.971,"Now, in this case, who would pay his expenses?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,836.971,846.874,"In this particular case, the expenses would be worked out in accordance with a voluntary agreement between the Marshals Service and the County of Philadelphia."
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,846.874,851.934,I am trying to find out what is that voluntary agreement.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,851.934,858.618,"Well, I don't know the correct terms... I don't know the exact terms of that agreement in this particular case, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.618,863.46,"Well, you talk about the additional... There are no additional expenses in this case."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,867.709,879.375,"There is no record in this case, but the magistrate found in making his order that the bus... The Marshals traveled regularly to and from the House of Detention to the Federal Courthouse."
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.375,884.232,"And, is there any showing that this precedent would cause additional expense?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,884.232,887.793,There is no showing of any kind because there is no record.
1985.84-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.071,902.538,"May I ask, during the day at the Federal Courthouse he is in federal custody, as I understand it, and nobody disputes that."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,902.538,903.663,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.663,906.192,Who buys his lunch if he has to spend the day there?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,906.192,922.046,"Well, I am not certain about who buys his lunch in the Federal Courthouse, but from my experience as Attorney General as a prosecutor I believe that his lunch would be provided by the United States Marshals because he is in their custody inside the courthouse in this case."
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.046,945.24,"General Zimmerman, when you say you are not arguing burden, and yet I take it that the magistrate would not have been free to say that the state has paid enough of these costs so I am going to pick someone out of the courtroom here and have him required to pay the expenses from the Detention Center in Philadelphia to the Federal Courthouse."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,949.658,956.5,I believe that in this particular case anything that will lessen that burden of proceeding--
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.5,963.044,"But, you conceded, I take it, that you can't call upon bystanders to lessen the burden."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,963.044,968.339,"--I don't take the position in this case that Section 1651, the All Writs Act, is unlimited."
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.319,983.177,All the All Writs Act gives you is a remedy if there is something you are entitled to under some other standard.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,983.457,994.017,I believe the Court was entitled to do what it did here in order to get these witnesses from where they are incarcerated to a federal court to vindicate their rights.
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.015,1009.884,"But, it is conceded, isn't it, that the magistrate also had power to bring... to order the state to bring the people from the Correction Center in Western Pennsylvania to the Federal Courthouse."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1009.884,1011.961,That is correct and that is what he did in this case.
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.459,1020.926,My question wasn't from the Correctional Center to the Philadelphia.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1029.547,1030.407,--The magistrate.
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.407,1032.452,"I am sorry, the magistrate, yes."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1032.452,1044.526,"The magistrate had the authority and, in fact, did in this case say bring the prisoners from wherever they are incarcerated throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the various institutions to Philadelphia."
1985.84-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.667,1055.881,"But now my question is do you or do you not admit that he would have had the authority to go further and say not just bring them to Philadelphia, but bring them to the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1055.881,1063.816,"--Yes, he would have, but I argue in this case he considered the burden and an attempt to lessen the burden on the state custodian somewhat."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.527,1204.182,Was a writ issued in this case?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1204.182,1209.914,"An order was issued in this case, Justice White, by the magistrate, by Magistrate Hall."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.914,1213.209,Mr. Attorney General--
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1215.788,1219.989,The magistrate did not label the writ.
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.159,1266.485,What if a writ of habeas corpus had just been served on the custodian?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1269.921,1270.561,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.561,1272.108,Bring him to the courthouse.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1272.108,1272.639,"Yes, it would have."
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.639,1275.637,"Well, suppose that is all that would have been served on the custodian?"
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1276.293,1280.433,Then the custodian would have been required to bring him to the courthouse.
1985.84-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.432,1289.805,"So, there is this provision for getting witnesses to the courthouse, but the magistrate didn't use that, he used an order."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1289.805,1305.391,"--In the calculus of the magistrate, and without a record I suggest it is impossible to be precise, but in the calculus of the magistrate's order, in examining that order, you will see that he took into account the principles and the concerns that I say are in the All Writs Act to be used by the Court."
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.355,1328.507,Mr. Attorney General assuming that the week before this occurred the prisoner had been transferred to California.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1332.162,1341.393,"Assuming that the All Writs Act provides the authorities, I urge that it does, then it would have been up to the magistrate to determine."
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1344.548,1353.902,Who would you suggest in conformity with your theory would be responsible for transporting him back to Philadelphia?
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1353.902,1372.926,"--I believe that if the magistrate directed and knew that the Marshal was going to Chicago once a week regularly, it would not have been improper for the magistrate to have fashioned an order to say, Marshal, bring the prisoner from California to Chicago and the state will be required to--"
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1372.926,1376.081,"Let's make one little minor change, Hawaii."
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1376.081,1378.408,"--Well, I think--"
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.408,1383.361,I don't know of any Marshal that goes from Philadelphia to Hawaii regularly.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1383.361,1384.765,--I don't think that the question--
1985.84-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.765,1387.156,You don't really mean just because he goes there.
1985.84-489,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1400.525,1405.866,--I think that either one could be ordered to pay completely.
1985.84-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1451.145,1455.299,Mr. Levy?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1455.299,1459.704,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.336,1640.6,"Mr. Levy, can I interrupt with a question that goes to the question of power rather than whether it is a good idea or not?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1640.6,1640.818,Sure.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.818,1658.405,"Supposing you had an emergency situation, a fire at the County Detention Center or an escape or a riot or something like that, and the state was short of personnel and couldn't get a witness to the courthouse and they let the district judge know and the district judge said, well, we want to go ahead with the trial and it is the only way we can get the witness here."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1664.699,1669.495,"Well, first, in those circumstances it is exceedingly likely that the Marshal would agree to go out and do that."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.495,1672.133,Let's assume the question is one of power.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1675.819,1678.615,"The answer is he might, but that is a much different situation from what we have here."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.217,1702.824,--What would be the source of the federal judge's authority to enter such an order?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1702.824,1707.105,"Well, for example, if the state custodian simply refused to comply with an order that was within his capability--"
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.105,1708.212,"Well, take my hypothetical."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1714.647,1721.879,"--Well, the question would be whether... as part of enforcing an order that directive to the Marshal would be appropriate."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.501,1736.733,"Well, assume you get a state of facts which you would agree for purposes of my question that it is either necessary or appropriate to go get him."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1739.264,1741.668,--I am doubtful that there would be.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.511,1748.37,"Isn't that, in jurisdictional terms, the same issue that we have here?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1748.37,1750.383,"Well, not necessarily."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1765.799,1770.578,He just delivers him from the intermediate point to the courthouse.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1770.578,1776.357,"--But, the Marshal would not be acting in lieu of or as the surrogate custodian in that case."
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.727,1807.095,"Mr. Levy, getting it closer to this case, a judge tells the Marshal, I have a witness who is in the House of Detention in Philadelphia that I need for trial this afternoon."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1829.226,1835.068,"Nothing may be wrong with it and the Marshal in most instances, I assume, would be agreeable to complying in his discretion."
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.645,1838.706,"And, that is the difference between this case?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1838.706,1839.347,--Yes.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.424,1847.047,"So, the whole question is he was ordered and not asked?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1847.047,1848.828,"Well, the question here is one of judicial--"
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.828,1849.766,Is that the difference?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1849.766,1851.655,--The question here is one of judicial power.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.655,1852.359,Is that the difference?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1852.359,1853.56,"Yes, but that has nothing--"
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.56,1854.873,That is what you are complaining about?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1854.873,1855.779,--We are complaining about--
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.779,1857.309,If he had asked it would have been all right.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1857.309,1863.073,--If you are asking if the Marshal chose to do it because it was not inconsistent or a burden on his other responsibilities.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.039,1907.696,In the city the size of Philadelphia.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1907.696,1907.961,I'm sorry?
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.961,1910.038,In the city the size of Philadelphia.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1910.038,1910.398,That is correct.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.982,1936.654,Let me get one other thing straight in my mind.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1951.975,1954.35,"Incidents with courthouse security responsibility, that is correct."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.35,1960.613,Supposing you had a situation as you do in Chicago where there is a Federal Detention Center about a block from the Federal Courthouse.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1966.595,1968.923,"Again, it is a matter of judicial power to require the Marshal to do that."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.562,1976.918,"But, you would say the extent of judicial power is the exterior walls of the building which houses the Federal Courthouse?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1976.918,1983.057,The Court of Appeals looked over a somewhat broader exception where the security needed required the custody be transferred outside the courthouse.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.702,2020.776,"But, if the Marshal has the responsibility for the courthouse, where does the judge get the power to tell the Marshal what do it in the courthouse?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2020.776,2025.789,"Well, the Marshal would have the discretion how to implement the courthouse security."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.789,2030.944,The judge can order the Marshal though to be responsible for security in the elevator.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2033.817,2038.049,"Whether he is to be responsible for security, we would agree, could be imposed by the judge."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.784,2040.58,What is the source of the judge's power to do that?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2040.58,2044.345,--That would be under 569(a) of 28 U.S. Code.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.345,2045.782,Which says what about judge's power?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2045.782,2052.123,"It says that the Marshal may, in the discretion of the court, be required to attend any session of court."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.123,2053.138,Any session of court.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2053.138,2056.277,"And, if the Marshal has agreed and not raised any--"
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.277,2058.619,Any session of court includes riding up and down an elevator.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2058.619,2061.931,--The Marshal hasn't challenged that construction of the statute.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.931,2062.681,"But, do you think it is correct?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2062.681,2065.382,I think it is certainly within the Marshal's--
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.382,2066.132,"No, no."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2069.475,2076.487,"--We think it is certainly a permissible reading for the Marshal to make of its own statute, that this confers power on the court to do that."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.065,2082.876,"In other words, the judge should defer to the expertise of the Marshal in construing that statute."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2082.876,2088.92,"Well, as on any statutory construction, the reading of the agency whose statute it is is entitled to substantial deference."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.255,2161.453,"Of course, that isn't necessarily a compelling argument, because what may be permissible as the distribution of burden within the federal system may not be permissible when you go outside the federal system and ask the state to produce some--"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2161.453,2170.262,"--Our point here though is that the custodian has the obligation and we agree that obligation would apply to us if these were federal prisoners, just as it applies to the state where they are state prisoners."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.999,2265.086,"--Mr. Levy, what if someone commenced a lawsuit in the Federal Court in the Eastern District of Philadelphia and said we are proceeding IFP and made the necessary affidavits and then decides that he wants to subpoena some witnesses."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2273.708,2276.925,That is something of an unanswered question.
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.925,2283.906,Why should they have to come if they don't get the statutory witness and mileage fees if there is no exception for IFP plaintiff?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2283.906,2285.936,"Well, I think that in the end is probably the right argument."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.936,2294.886,"So, the in forma pauperis plaintiff can't compel witnesses outside of prisons to come without paying mileage and witness fees."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2294.886,2299.447,"As I said, it is unresolved, but I don't disagree with that proposition."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.887,2338.291,Even though it is a custodial situation and not just the payment of witness fees and mileage?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2338.291,2340.086,That would be correct.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.816,2366.154,"Mr. Levy, was there any effort or is there any effort now to work this out amicably between the state, the federal government, the judges, and the Marshals?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2366.154,2369.745,"I think there was an effort, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful."
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.745,2376.728,I don't see why we have this tension between the magistrate and a Marshal.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2379.883,2385.146,"Yes, they are, and almost in all instances they work in a cooperative way."
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.146,2388.02,Were any efforts made to work this out?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2388.02,2390.738,I believe efforts were made and they were simply unsuccessful.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.763,2405.168,Did they sit down?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2405.168,2407.84,--I believe that they did try to work it out.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.84,2408.948,"You believe, but you don't know?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2408.948,2410.323,I was not party to the discussions.
1985.84-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.682,2417.508,It seems to be it would have been much easier than bothering us with it.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2417.508,2419.68,"But, the issue in this case is not whether the parties can work it out."
1985.84-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2500.351,2514.19,"However, Mr. Levy, in the circumstances proposed, for example, by Justice Stevens, conceivably it is arguable under some extreme circumstances that might be necessary and appropriate."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2514.19,2519.375,"Under some extreme circumstances, it might be necessary and appropriate in the literal sense."
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.339,2575.961,"Mr. Levy, is it consistent... Would it be consistent with your argument to say that the Marshal could agree to have done what he was ordered to do?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2575.961,2579.553,"--The Marshal, as a matter of executive discretion, could agree and the regulations--"
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.553,2580.99,Where would he have the authority to do that?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2580.99,2583.02,"--Well, there would be two sources."
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.252,2594.094,My question is where would they get the authority to do it?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2594.094,2598.733,It would be an inherent exercise of executive authority to--
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.733,2605.012,Do you mean the Marshals can just issue a writ on the Treasury of the United States without authority to do so?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2605.012,2615.35,"--No, but our position would be that the Attorney General, who supervises the Marshals, has the inherent authority to direct the Marshals in the exercise of their normal duties and that where there is--"
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.35,2619.099,Whether or not there is any express authority for it.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2619.099,2629.642,"--There are many instances where there is inherent authority or authority that is implied from the statute, if you will, that is not express authority."
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.75,2639.013,"So, you really are just relying on the separation argument to a great extent."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2652.227,2656.224,There is a considerable difference between authorizing the executive to do something--
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.224,2659.989,"Well, there may be, but that is just about where you stand, isn't it?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2659.989,2662.566,--That is an important part of our argument.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.731,2694.99,"May I ask as a follow-up on Justice White's question that if instead of volunteering to do the transportation initially you had a situation in which the state had done the transportation, as was true in the Seventh Circuit case, and then came in and asked for reimbursement from the Marshal."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2706.423,2710.5,Where it did not itself carry out the transportation?
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.5,2714.593,The state just sent a bill and said we produced all these prisoners and it cost us this much money.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2714.593,2724.51,"Well, in the circumstances of the Seventh Circuit case where there was an outstanding order to the Marshal to transport them, the Marshal simply ignored that order."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.51,2736.411,"Assume it just went to the state and they said, well, we will decide who bears the expense later and after the case is over the state just calls up the Marshals and said it cost us $400 to transport these prisoners, would you mind paying it."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2740.254,2743.94,I am not certain of the answer.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.97,2747.376,Why is it different as a matter of power whether you pay it in advance or later?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2747.376,2748.563,But--
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.563,2749.704,It is the same power.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2749.704,2751.608,"--But, the Marshals' power--"
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.608,2752.233,It is the same burden on the--
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2752.233,2758.653,--The Marshals' power would be to engage in activities that are within the control of the Attorney General.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.726,2769.147,"--Well, it relates."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2771.943,2776.988,"But, the issue in this case is the power of the court, not the power of the Attorney General or the Executive Branch to do something on its own."
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.988,2780.19,Your view is the Marshal has greater discretion than the judge?
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2780.19,2783.08,It is a common situation.
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.729,2804.197,"But, there must be more limits than I get the impression you say there are."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2818.471,2829.624,"I doubt that that would be, but here, the duties are those of a kind the Marshal normally exercises and I think it is within the Attorney General's control to indicate how the Marshals should be deployed."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.437,2881.634,"Why is the Marshal willing to do this latter thing, transport prisoners between states for state proceedings, but not to do what the magistrate in this case said he should do?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2881.634,2894.582,"Once again, the Marshal would be free in this case, but in those other instances, he decides that the transportation of a particular prisoner in a particular set of circumstances does not detract from the exercise of his other duties."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.615,2933.909,"But, a district judge or a magistrate could under 28 U.S.C. 569."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2937.08,2938.22,That is correct.
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.22,2945.779,"And, it could order the Marshal to execute any lawful writs, process of papers, issued out of the court."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2945.779,2948.59,Anything that is properly addressed.
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2948.59,2949.262,Yes.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2949.262,2965.069,"Let me discuss the statute there which is what the magistrate specifically relied on, 28 U.S.C. 569(b), which provides that the Marshal shall execute all lawful writs, process and orders of federal courts."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.179,3048.473,"But now here the Marshal could have issued the subpoena ad testificandum and directed the Marshal to deliver to the custodian of the state prison, could he not?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3048.473,3050.534,"I am afraid I didn't understand the question, Justice."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.534,3065.559,The magistrate could have issued a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum to produce these witnesses from the Western State Penitentiary and directed the Marshal to serve that writ on the custodian.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3065.559,3066.871,"To serve the writ, yes."
1985.84-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3066.871,3067.121,Yes.
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3067.121,3067.73,That is right.
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.003,3089.861,"The writs were issued in this case, weren't they?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3089.861,3091.159,They were orders.
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.438,3098.077,"Well, who served them on the state?"
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3098.077,3101.279,I am not certain of the answer to that.
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.527,3111.884,"So, the Marshal to serve them would have to go to these penitentiaries."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3111.884,3116.164,It may be that there is an official for service in Philadelphia.
1985.84-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.537,3130.236,"Mr. Levy, as I understand it, since about 1976 or 1977 the circuits that have addressed this problem have all gone the other way from the Third Circuit."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3138.107,3138.888,It has not.
1985.84-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.819,3200.114,"But, there would be authority, inherent authority, you say, for the Marshals Service to undertake that obligation within its discretion."
1985.84-489,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3201.817,3203.941,"We think if the Marshal wanted to, it could do so, that is correct."
1985.84-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3225.837,3228.758,"Do you have anything further, General?"
1985.84-489,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3228.758,3232.351,"A very, very brief rebuttal, one point."
1985.84-489,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3273.475,3274.506,"Thank you, gentlemen."
