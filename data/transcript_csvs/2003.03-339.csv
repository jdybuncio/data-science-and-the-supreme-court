2003.03-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,39.537,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-339, Jose Francisco Sosa v. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, and the United States v. the same."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,70.455,73.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.633,157.526,"Mr. Clement, you... you have a number of strings to your bow."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,161.829,163.69,"Well, regrettably--"
2003.03-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.69,172.706,"I mean, it... it's unlikely that we're going to go through the whole list of your... your reasons for reversing here and say you're right on every one."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,178.241,191.119,"--Well, regrettably, Justice Scalia, this is the rare case where I think they really are of quite significance because what the Ninth Circuit has held is, on the one hand, Federal agents, including the FBI, would lack the authority to make arrests abroad."
2003.03-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.069,209.281,That's not your... you're just arguing the Federal Tort Claims Act first.
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,216.106,220.099,--I actually intend to cover them both in... in my initial period.
2003.03-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.797,256.716,"Well, getting back to Justice Scalia's question, I... I suppose the President or the Attorney General could make an order with respect to extraterritorial arrests, and that would eliminate one rationale of the court of appeals."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,257.577,271.526,"Well, I think you are wrong about that, Justice Kennedy, because as I read the ruling of the Ninth Circuit, they say that the President, the executive, the Attorney General lack the authority to make an extraterritorial arrest, and they specifically--"
2003.03-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.526,273.649,I guess you would have to get to that issue first.
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,273.649,275.341,--That's right.
2003.03-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.802,280.126,"And they said even if it had the authority, it... it has to be from a high official."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,280.126,283.509,--That actually wasn't the... the reasoning of the majority opinion.
2003.03-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.241,300.812,Were... were the majority--
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,307.537,309.688,"--I... I think that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.339,334.525,"Yes, but you certainly don't have to address that if you think they're wrong as a statutory matter, that there... there, in fact, was no arbitrary arrest here."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,334.525,336.746,"That's exactly right, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.69,340.069,"No, no."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,340.069,343.892,"I think, though, there's nothing that would stop the Court from addressing those issues, and those--"
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.892,356.071,"Well, we'd have to be pretty ambitious because some of them weren't addressed below and they're contrary... the position being taken today is contrary to the position taken by previous Solicitors General."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,363.765,371.49,"--Well, we think it was raised and argued below, Justice O'Connor, and I think the 1350 issue is of tremendous continuing importance."
2003.03-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,439.4,451.588,"As to your first, the tremendous problems, how many lawsuits are there of this 1350 nature and how many have even gone to judgment?"
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,451.588,455.142,"Justice Ginsburg, regrettably, I don't have the numbers on those."
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.137,536.921,"Has Congress been asked to take a look at the statute and to amend it or... or restrict it in some fashion, 1350?"
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,536.921,539.105,--I'm sure there have certainly been--
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.105,541.816,Are there bills introduced to do that?
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,541.816,548.191,"--I don't know that any bills are pending, but I do think that Congress is certainly fully able to deal with this situation."
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,548.191,549.012,"Well, I think so."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,549.743,559.581,"Definitely, and... and... but I think when Congress does deal with this situation and actually provides for a cause of action, that provides a much better solution to this problem."
2003.03-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.556,568.088,That's all... that's a good example of where Congress took action.
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,588.394,603.123,"--Again, Justice O'Connor, I mean, I can only repeat that there's nothing that would stop this Court from resting its decision only on the extraterritorial authority question and that would certainly be a significant correction of the law because the Ninth Circuit has left us--"
2003.03-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.123,615.06,"But, Mr. Clement, on that... on that point, your point that there must be another Federal statute enacted creating a cause of action, because this is purely jurisdictional, I have yet to find any judge who's taken that position."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,617.892,628.601,"--Well, I think that... that... I don't know that Judge Randolph in his separate opinion in the Al Odah case expressly... if you can tell exactly where he would come down on that."
2003.03-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.276,663.014,"Well, I understand all the cases since Cort against Ash support you, but we're construing a statute enacted a long, long time ago, and there was all sorts of... of opinion to the effect that there were at least two or three causes of action that did not need to be severally created: privacy, protecting ambassadors, and so forth."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,671.962,675.804,"--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, let me take that in a couple of steps."
2003.03-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.336,773.939,"Well, what about the cues that you get from the Torture Victim Protection Act?"
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,801.469,817.351,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I could just make sure that there's one fact that's on the table, which is you said that they... that Congress effectively had the provisions side by side, and I think it is worth noting that although the Torture Victim Protection Act is now codified as a note to 1350, that was not a decision Congress made."
2003.03-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,823.557,829.601,But there was discussion of 1350 by the proponents of the Torture Victim Protection Act.
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,829.601,839.539,--There certainly was and I think that... that basically the enactment of Congress is... sort of says nothing about 1350 one way or another.
2003.03-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.694,922.67,"But, Mr. Clement, if I... if I remember, some of the briefs have taken the position that that's already an aspect of international law, a requirement that you should first exhaust in the country where the conduct took place, which would... would narrow the scope of the statute if we... if we adopted that view."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,922.67,930.516,"--Well, Justice Stevens, there certainly are international jurists that will argue that exhaustion principles are a principle of international law."
2003.03-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,978.86,979.541,But in the... in the--
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,996.814,998.375,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, and thank you."
2003.03-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.821,1100.444,Doesn't the Mansfield Amendment tug the other way?
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1108.331,1120.808,"With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I actually think the Mansfield Amendment supports the view of the United States here, and indeed, under the view of the Ninth Circuit, it's entirely unclear what the Mansfield Amendment was supposed to accomplish."
2003.03-339,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.783,1179.994,"But isn't... isn't it possible to read... and I'm not sure it should be read this way, but isn't it possible to read the Mansfield Amendment as simply saying DEA agents should not go out in foreign police raids when the police of the foreign countries make the raids."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1184.848,1187.671,"That's certainly... that is one way you could read it, Justice Souter."
2003.03-339,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1194.669,1196.97,It doesn't... but it doesn't imply anything one way or the other.
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1196.97,1197.23,Right.
2003.03-339,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.911,1255.692,"Of course, you get there by assuming that anything that the DEA does is law enforcement."
2003.03-339,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1255.692,1269.032,"That's a fair point, but I think even if that's a bit of a broad conception, I certainly think assisting in the context of a foreign police action should qualify as law enforcement."
2003.03-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.388,1329.818,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1331.881,1347.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1358.81,1360.312,Or whether we have to.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1360.312,1375.873,"--Well, you clearly don't have to, and... and certainly Jose Francisco Sosa would be perfectly content to have the judgment of the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the arrest here was neither arbitrary nor the detention prolonged in a way that would no... under no circumstances violate the law of nations."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1440.814,1454.791,"Well, there are indications early in the country's history that it was viewed differently at the time of its adoption, and the... an Attorney General early on took that view."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1471.123,1472.706,"But... but, Justice O'Connor--"
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1472.706,1475.047,And it's hard to ignore all that.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1480.029,1491.378,"--Well, I think the presumption ought to go the other way is that to the extent that the lower courts have created a problem, it would be incumbent upon the Court to try to fix that problem if that's an available option--"
2003.03-339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.378,1493.418,You agree it's easily changed by Congress?
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1493.418,1493.889,--I'm sorry?
2003.03-339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.889,1495.802,You agree it's easily changed by--
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1495.802,1498.493,"Well, I don't think anything is easily changed by Congress these days."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1533.175,1536.387,--It probably had in mind problems of piracy.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1536.387,1543.674,"Well, it clearly had in mind problems of piracy, but as even Blackstone made clear, problems of piracy are matters of public concern."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.293,1560.406,And then we have the case of the attack on the early diplomat and so on.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1562.308,1571.244,"--Well, first of all, there's an interesting gap in that history because you go up till about 1807 and then nothing happens until 1982."
2003.03-339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.773,1584.945,Maybe we didn't assault any ambassadors during that later period.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1586.037,1589.22,I certainly hope we didn't.
2003.03-339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.22,1595.444,"But, of course, I... most references to international law were in admiralty cases where there's jurisdiction anyway."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1595.444,1596.866,"To be sure, absolutely."
2003.03-339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.657,1599.68,"Yes, but not in the ambassador cases."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1599.68,1600.238,--No.
2003.03-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.238,1605.403,"It was pretty clearly, it seems to me, one of the things that the statute would have covered for the assault of the French ambassador."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1605.403,1619.091,"It's not... well, it's not 100 percent clear to me because the... the problem you have there is that it would clearly have been a public right and it was... and, you know, the Congress in 1790 immediately passes a statute that... that imposes criminal sanction for this."
2003.03-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.824,1633.996,"But, Mr. Phillips--"
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1633.996,1635.458,This is a very unknown enterprise.
2003.03-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.458,1644.287,"--One of the... one of the things that I keep bumping up against... and I want to be sure you get an opportunity to comment on it... that... 1980, I guess it was, the Second Circuit got into the act and decided that case."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1650.534,1653.766,"Well, I don't... I don't... I don't disagree with it."
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.403,1683.207,"I thought... I thought you'd probably have a... a right to recover damages for piracy, wouldn't you have?"
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1686.239,1689.562,"--Well, it's not clear, but if you would have, it would have been under admiralty jurisdiction."
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1689.562,1695.676,"Well, admiralty and maritime law then I thought were viewed as a brooding omnipresence."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1695.676,1696.287,They were.
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.287,1696.588,They weren't the law of Athens.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1700.785,1701.612,Well--
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.612,1705.345,And that... that... you can find lots of quotations along those lines.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1715.673,1728.532,"--Well, let... let me answer the first question because the difference between incorporating the law of nations from the... into admiralty jurisdiction, it had a tradition of 1,000 years."
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1742.794,1753.953,"It would not be improbable in a world where law was a brooding omnipresence in the sky to think that we preserve it in the case of admiralty, maritime, and certain instances of international law."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1776.651,1786.829,"But I... I... the difficulty I have with that, Justice Breyer, is I think this Court has rebelled from the idea that it's going to incorporate a massive brooding omnipresence--"
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.829,1787.478,Not massive.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1788.419,1789.401,"--But, see, I don't think--"
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.401,1791.911,That's why I keep bringing up the European Commission.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1791.911,1797.527,"--But, see, that's my problem with that... with that argument because it doesn't... I don't see what the limitation is, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1826.201,1826.361,All right.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1827.553,1828.094,--that the federalism principle was--
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.094,1844.116,"So what... what is... what I got out of that brief... and I refer to one, and I want to get your views on that... is it wouldn't be difficult to have a limited cause of action, try to find the counterpart, and say, of course, if Congress preempts the field, as maybe it did with torture, that's out."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1875.489,1880.814,--But that brief assumes that 1350 does more than provide jurisdiction.
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.814,1881.525,"Yes, that's correct."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1881.525,1882.405,It assumes that there is a cause of action.
2003.03-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.405,1882.565,That's correct.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1889.71,1890.3,"Well, to be sure."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.788,1916.9,It may also--
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1916.9,1917.531,We don't have any quarrel with that on--
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.531,1919.211,--It may also be correct.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1919.211,1921.682,"--Well, to be sure, it's correct."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.682,1926.097,"I mean, you're not... you're not saying that's a wrong interpretation, are you?"
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1926.097,1926.337,"No, no."
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.533,1959.5,"And presumably if there is some cause of action alleged in any of these actions that have been or might be filed, that deal with something that is covered basically by a treaty that Congress has said is non-self-executing, I assume that would displace any common law background."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1959.5,1982.947,"--Well, I think that you raise an important point there which is the parallelism between the treaty prong and the law of nations prong of the statute because if, as... as Judge Bork explained in his separate opinion, the thing that disturbed him the most about this was the suggestion that somehow on behalf of aliens, you would create a right under the treaty that you would... that... that citizens would never have had the right to because it wouldn't be self-executing."
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2018.275,2018.455,Okay.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2071.03,2079.976,"Well, I think the easiest way to ensure consistency there would be to insist that there be a... a real clarity, both that the United States is--"
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2079.976,2082.52,"No, but that... that then just takes you to Justice Breyer."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2082.901,2083.008,"--Well, no."
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2083.659,2083.91,--Okay.
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2083.91,2085.312,Because I think in that world--
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2085.312,2090.334,You're saying the only way to get where I have suggested we might go is Justice Breyer's way?
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2090.334,2090.474,--No.
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2105.704,2106.956,"Let me... well, I'm not... no."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2122.748,2123.359,Can... can I challenge that assumption--
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.359,2123.76,"Yes, yes."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2123.76,2124.301,--Justice Souter?
2003.03-339,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.114,2142.487,Is it clear that there was nothing in the absence of... of action by the States?
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2154.865,2167.565,"--But... but... the... the... I... I think there are no causes of action because the... if you take seriously... why... why would the Continental Congress say to the States, enact a statute to protect ambassadors if ambassadors are otherwise being protected?"
2003.03-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2322.703,2323.544,"Well, we can deal with that issue."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2323.544,2343.63,"--And you should deal with that issue, but... but, Justice O'Connor, I think you should try to deal with the broader issue because there are just too many of these cases out there creating too much havoc for no good reason, if I'm right, that the Congress in 1789 did not have in mind something anywhere... anything like what we've seen since 1982."
2003.03-339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.528,2361.203,"They did use the word tort, which is... was... was surprising to me that they used it at that early date."
2003.03-339,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2364.085,2365.657,--They did use the word tort.
2003.03-339,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.312,2410.602,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2416.058,2419.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.127,2458.556,May I ask--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2460.286,2460.477,I'm sorry.
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.258,2464.412,May I ask... may I ask this question as a matter of history because your right on the point now?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2475.229,2490.877,"--Well, I think that the... the kinds of law of... law of nations violations at the time would have included piracy, which clearly... in terms of another country, I mean, it's certainly possible that a... an assault on an ambassador could have taken place in another country."
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.877,2494.209,"Yes, but the only ones they knew about had taken place in the United States."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2494.209,2503.836,"Well, the ones that they were most concerned about was the 1784 Marbois incident and the one in 1788, the Dutch ambassador in New York City, were the ones most on their mind."
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.836,2510.191,"They certainly would not have been concerned about an assault on the... say, the English ambassador in Paris by a Frenchman."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2510.191,2518.546,"Well, that's not entirely clear, I mean, because if there was a... one of the things that was before them was the transitory tort doctrine."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.353,2548.326,"Well, you wouldn't need the... the law of nations for a transitory tort."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2549.167,2549.357,--Excuse me?
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.357,2553.581,--You... you don't need the law of nations to sue on a transitory tort.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2553.581,2554.322,"No, of course, not."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.322,2558.736,"If it was a tort in the country where it was committed, you... you could sue on it elsewhere."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2558.736,2558.917,No.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.484,2587.447,"If... if there was this background of... of understood common law that you say, how do you explain the 1781 action of the Continental Congress which is concerned about the fact that... that there's no redress for... for assault on ambassadors, among other things?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2587.447,2587.667,Well--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.667,2589.971,"And they asked the States, do something about it."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2589.971,2590.8,"--Well, certainly the--"
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.8,2593.774,"If that... that was part of the understood common law, what is the problem?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2593.774,2600.059,"--Well, one of the... one of the... first of all, Longchamps is one response to that in the sense that in Pennsylvania they didn't need a statute."
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2608.106,2613.211,"Yes, but that goes against the notion that there was an understood common understanding that was the background."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2618.526,2618.686,No.
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.066,2647.298,"Then why did they pass a resolution saying to the States, enforce the common law?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2647.298,2652.581,"--Well, what they did is they asked the... the States to enforce the law of nations."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.872,2757.588,Part... part of the problem I have with... with your... your proposal is that it leaves it up... it leaves it up to the courts to decide what the law of nations is.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2779.393,2784.508,"Well, there are two... I have two responses, Justice Scalia, to that question."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.952,2840.347,"Those... those are pretty polar instances, piracy and... and sabotage in... in time of war."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2845.972,2847.012,"--Well, in the... in the--"
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.012,2856.569,"And I... sure, I can tell you some things that everybody would agree is against the law of nations, but there are a lot of things in between that the European Union may think is bad and we may not think is bad."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2856.569,2862.803,"--Well, but actually I think that that is... would not be a correct view of... either of what the courts did or what the courts ought to do."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.809,2886.539,But that's not your case.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2886.539,2890.502,"Well, you're right, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.592,2906.314,"Well, there was legal authority here."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2909.286,2914.832,"Well, he was indicted by a grand jury and there was an arrest warrant that was limited to the territorial boundaries of the United States."
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.832,2915.022,Well--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2915.022,2917.035,There was no authority to arrest him in Mexico.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2917.035,2933.247,"--yes, but I... I think there's a good argument that section 878 has extraterritorial application, that DEA agents are not prevented from carrying out their duties across our borders."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2933.247,2954.341,"Well, I think that the... the distinction... and... and... that needs to be made on that is that it is clear that the Congress was aware, as we all are aware, that the Drug Enforcement Administration has involved in activities in other countries of a variety of activities."
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2954.341,2955.44,"Well, like in that case of--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2955.44,2955.61,They're supportive.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2955.61,2976.614,--United States v. Bowman dealing with a ship and... and exercise of criminal law enforcement outside our borders and we thought there was in that case no presumption against extraterritoriality.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2976.614,2977.135,"Well, that's--"
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2977.135,2982.909,And I think there may well not be in this DEA context as well.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2982.909,2987.543,--The... the... I hope to persuade you otherwise on that point.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3004.976,3010.101,"No, but we certainly... in Bowman we said that the Coast Guard could enforce revenue laws--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3010.101,3010.281,Sure.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3010.281,3018.388,"--outside our borders, and very likely a DEA agent can enforce our laws beyond our borders."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3018.388,3020.97,Bowman... Bowman was about jurisdiction to proscribe.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.917,3075.879,How can you read the statute to include the one and not include the other?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3090.41,3091.159,I don't think that it... I don't think that--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.159,3094.261,--How can you read the statute to permit the one but not permit the other?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3094.261,3104.159,"--Well, I don't think that it follows that... that you have to assume that Congress intended that... that entire statute had to have complete extraterritorial effect."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.936,3133.778,Tell me what language could possibly allow you to draw that... that distinction in the text of the statute.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3136.011,3137.971,"--Well, the--"
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.971,3139.664,--between arrest and investigation.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3139.664,3151.901,"--I think that the difference would be that the Congress... one of the arguments that the Government is making, because they don't... there's nothing in the... in the statute that tells you that arrest authority is extraterritorial either."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.576,3156.017,Right.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3156.017,3173.02,"And... and under the Government's theory, in fact in their reply brief, they say that the citizens arrest statute in California is the same to section 878, which means that 36 million people in... in the State of California can engage in extraterritorial arrests too."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.02,3173.589,I didn't like that--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3173.589,3179.542,And so there has... there have to be some other limitations and some other inquiries--
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3179.542,3179.692,--Okay.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3182.245,3182.735,--Yes.
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.735,3183.206,What's the second principle?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3183.206,3186.789,"Let me... the... the other limitation... the other... well, there are two really."
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3196.137,3202.052,"Well, look, there... that amendment refers to foreign police action."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3203.434,3205.524,--But in the... on the Government's theory--
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3205.524,3206.035,None.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3208.627,3234.055,"--But in the Government's theory, what that would mean is that if... if the Government wanted to arrest a drug trafficker in Mexico and they... they would be barred by the Mansfield Amendment from actually being involved in that arrest, even participating in it unless the ambassador to Mexico approved it under the... the rules, but under their theory, they could actually hire the people that they hired in this case to arrest the trafficker."
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3238.449,3239.951,What does the term direct mean?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3239.951,3245.635,"--Well, I... direct... what... what happened in this case was certainly directly effecting the arrest."
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3250.249,3253.221,"Well, in that sense every arrest is a direct arrest."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3256.594,3258.196,"Well, I... I think what the... what the difference--"
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.196,3260.147,Doesn't direct refer to the... to the actions of the agents?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3260.147,3264.321,--But I think what the difference was is the Mansfield Amendment was broader than just arresting.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.017,3290.052,"If that was so, why didn't he just eliminate from this as part of any foreign police action?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3291.775,3298.938,"--Well, but the thing is from our standpoint, I mean, this is a foreign... this... this is a police action in a foreign country."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.938,3299.449,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3304.193,3304.924,I--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.924,3308.157,You... you think it's foreign police action.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3308.157,3317.963,--I really think that... that the... the intent of the Mansfield Amendment was not to allow DEA agents to get involved in arrests that caused problems for our foreign relations.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3320.405,3320.595,Okay.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3327.26,3344.381,"Well, the other... the other principle, though, which I think is the one that... that I think clearly applies to this case is... is the principle that statutes need to be interpreted to be consistent with our international law obligations, the Charming Betsy principle."
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3356.118,3359.531,You... you had... you told me you were going to give me two more principles.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3359.531,3359.562,That was the--
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3359.562,3360.693,One was Mansfield.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3361.785,3361.975,--This was it.
2003.03-339,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3364.088,3364.238,Okay.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3364.238,3364.389,Sorry.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.592,3384.093,They did it.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3474.564,3490.695,"--Well, I think that the... the first... in terms of the Alien Tort Claims Act, which I think is where the South Africa example is coming from mostly, I think that the... there... there are several limitations that are inherent in the jurisprudence."
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3521.66,3522.131,How can--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3522.131,3523.103,--is that the President didn't do that.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.103,3535.271,--How is that consistent with an acknowledgement that there is an automatically self-executing brooding omnipresence of customary international law?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3535.271,3535.441,Well--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.441,3536.884,That's just inconsistent with such a notion.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3536.884,3537.074,"--Well, no."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3569.506,3571.329,What about the commander-in-chief of the armed forces?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3573.861,3575.821,"--I don't know the answer to that, although--"
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3575.821,3576.522,Or the Secretary of State.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3577.473,3581.817,--I... I think that that it probably is the case that it goes down to the President and his cabinet.
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3643.148,3650.364,"Mr. Hoffman, a moment ago you cited the Charming Betsy for a principle that we defer to international law."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3653.817,3654.438,"Oh, no."
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3657.482,3660.803,Well... yours is the red brief?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3660.803,3671.041,"--Yes, and it's actually in the brief in... in 485, and it is the entire section--"
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3671.041,3675.194,"Oh, the other red brief."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3675.194,3683.679,--It's... it's section I(C) from pages 17 through I believe 28.
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.679,3683.979,Thank you.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3683.979,3707.448,"And... and the importance of that principle in this case is that... the... the Government wants you to read authorizing statutes as saying that any law enforcement agent, employee, or official by just having a general arrest authority, automatically has arrest authority over the world."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3721.821,3725.531,What if the other... what if the foreign state has no objection to it?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3731.137,3731.578,We... we accept--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3731.578,3734.032,"Under your theory, you'd say--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3734.032,3734.302,--No.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3734.302,3737.572,--this... this statute simply does not authorize foreign arrests.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3737.572,3741.996,That... that may be the... on the presumption of extraterritoriality and the way that--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3741.996,3742.337,Right.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3742.337,3743.419,--that the Ninth Circuit read it.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3807.595,3842.868,"Okay, but there... there... I think that the conduct that was the basis for the indictment here, the kidnap and torture and murder of a U.S. DEA agent in Mexico, can be punished in the United States in accordance with international law under the effects doctrine because we can criminalize conduct occurring in another country that has an effect on our country's security or core national interests, which clearly this did."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3842.868,3845.359,I completely agree with that.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3862.481,3862.662,Right.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3862.662,3871.578,But there is a difference between the jurisdiction to proscribe within international law and... and the jurisdiction to enforce those laws.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3885.49,3888.471,"Suppose he'd been guilty, convicted, 30 years."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3893.766,3898.769,"Well, for one thing, the... the court... the court below cut off damages."
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3898.769,3899.791,I'm not talking about this case.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3908.747,3912.419,"Certainly not under the rule below, and I think--"
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3912.419,3913.981,What's the right rule in your--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3913.981,3914.652,--What's the right rule?
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3924.439,3924.609,--Okay.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3967.272,3967.551,--Right.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3967.551,3974.465,"--that allows these suits in the court... how does it become limited in this circumstance, an analogous circumstance?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3974.465,3976.058,I apologize for not completing my answer.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3984.462,3997.732,"That's why I chose in my example aiding and abetting by a private citizen of the very bad thing of apartheid leaving... leading to deaths and... and violence, et cetera, as happened."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4007.477,4008.368,"--Well, I think it--"
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4008.368,4011.121,"You want to propose some other method, but to propose no method--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4011.121,4011.691,--Well--
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4011.691,4013.612,"--it seems to me, is to concede--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4013.612,4013.782,--What--
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4013.782,4017.895,--the validity of the Government's point about lawsuits here.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4017.895,4028.443,"--Well, I think that the... first of all, particularly in the corporate realm, there has not been a judgment yet against a corporation in an alien tort statute case."
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4137.1,4138.944,But wouldn't that doctrine require you to lose this lawsuit?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4138.944,4140.053,--Excuse me?
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4140.053,4143.966,Wouldn't the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies require you to lose this lawsuit?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4143.966,4148.758,"Well, no, actually because I don't... we... we can't get a remedy in Mexico against--"
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4148.758,4148.908,Why not?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4148.908,4151.372,--We certainly can't get a remedy in Mexico against Mr. Sosa.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4166.545,4167.145,What tort issue... what--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4170.799,4172.658,--We could sue him here in the State court.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4176.621,4178.074,Why... why can't you sue in Mexico?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4181.539,4184.891,--Where do we get... where do we get jurisdiction over him?
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4184.891,4185.913,He committed the tort in Mexico.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4185.913,4192.457,We don't have personal jurisdiction over--
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4192.457,4194.718,You... you don't need it.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4203.964,4220.807,"--Well, the only thing I can say is that for... we have now been litigating the case, as you know, since... for 12 years, and the exhaustion of... of local remedies has not come up as a defense."
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4223.71,4226.37,That's because a lot of people don't think it's part of international law probably.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4226.37,4226.721,--But--
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4231.103,4250.364,"What about restricting these lawsuits to instances of violation of basic norms of international law where the international law itself foresees universal jurisdiction in, of course, the absence of some indication from Congress that they don't want such lawsuits?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4250.364,4250.995,I think--
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4250.995,4256.57,"What about that... that will not help your case I don't think in this instance, but I'm looking in your opinion as an--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4256.57,4265.136,--I guess the question... the question is from our standpoint the... the Founders wanted to enforce the law of nations.
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4283.427,4287.681,"--It's the human rights enforcement push, is it not?"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4287.681,4288.823,"Well, I think it... I think it is."
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4328.765,4344.076,What about... what about the principle that you have some such violations which will work well if judges in every nation try to enforce them and others where the judges will fall over themselves with contradictory decisions creating a mess?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4360.22,4362.26,--I would have two... two responses really.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4372.528,4374.698,"But in many countries, criminal jurisdiction is--"
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4374.698,4375.219,--That's true.
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4375.219,4376.511,--accompanied by civil jurisdiction--
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4376.511,4377.019,"No, that's true."
2003.03-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4377.019,4378.491,--because they're right in the criminal courtroom.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4378.491,4385.657,"That's true, and there are differences in domestic statutes around the world in terms of... of enforcement of these kinds of human rights."
2003.03-339,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4463.791,4493.933,"Well, they did... they did in the Tort Victim Protection Act provide a definite claim, something with a... with a statute of limitations, which is not here, something with a definition of what torture is, not tort, the world of tort, so that... that that looks like a model of specificity where 1350 is just the opposite."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4493.933,4498.423,"Well, I think... well, that's because of when 1350 was drafted."
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4520.429,4529.205,"But you... you do... in 1983, you do have reference to very specific things, to provisions of Federal statutory law or to provisions of the Constitution."
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4529.205,4539.614,"--Well, and you have... you have in section 1988 a... a reference to State law, and this Court has often had reference to State law and sometimes it's had reference to rules that are based on... on different reasons."
2003.03-339,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4624.94,4635.097,What about a suit based on some norm covered by a treaty where Congress... where the Senate has said it's non-self-executing?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4635.097,4635.465,--Right.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4696.87,4697.441,Who... who decides this?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4700.052,4700.282,--The courts.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4701.033,4701.224,--I see.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4701.385,4703.157,The courts have always decided this kind of thing.
2003.03-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4703.157,4706.279,--51 percent of the countries of the world accept them?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4707.211,4707.371,No.
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4750.302,4751.461,May I just recall Sabbattino?
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4763.081,4768.044,--I don't... that would not be what I would view it as.
2003.03-339,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4776.492,4778.612,That's not what prompted Justice White's dissent.
2003.03-339,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,4789.64,4799.305,"My point I guess would be, though, that where there is diversity among nations or about the norm, then I don't think they can be forced... enforced within the alien tort statute."
2003.03-339,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4939.633,4941.155,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
2003.03-339,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4944.147,4945.727,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
