2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.872,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-1195, Boumediene v. Bush, and case 06-1196, Al Odah v. United States."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,12.574,19.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioners in these cases have three things in common."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.324,97.312,I thought that we ruled in the Hamdi case that procedures quite similar to those under the DTA were adequate for American citizens?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,97.312,132.318,"Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, what you ruled... as I understand what the plurality held in Hamdi was that so long as there was a process accompanying detention, that provided for meaningful notice of the factual grounds for detention, a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in response to that before a neutral tribunal with the assistance of counsel, that determination would certainly be entitled to substantial deference by a habeas court; and we don't dispute that."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,132.318,132.751,So that--
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,132.751,133.82,That's not what they got.
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,133.82,143.693,--So our judgment in this case depends upon whether we agree with you or the government that the procedures available under the DTA are meaningful under Hamdi?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,143.693,161.004,"It... I think your decision in this case, the question... the principal question we think is presented by the case is whether or not the DTA review of the CSRT procedures that occurred in this case adequately substitute for the writ of habeas corpus."
2007.06-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.004,167.241,"Mr. Waxman, how could that be, because the D.C. Circuit never got to that question?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,180.818,181.501,No.
2007.06-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.031,217.674,"So shouldn't we, if we agree with you, that there is authority in the D.C. Circuit, send it back to them to make that determination whether habeas being required, this is an adequate substitute."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,217.674,220.959,"--Well, I'm not saying that this Court couldn't do that."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,260.019,266.506,"Your argument wouldn't be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day, would it?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,271.391,291.889,"Well, I want to give a qualified disagreement with your hypothetical, because it's entirely clear that, as I think members of this Court have indicated and that habeas traditionally indicates, there may be military exigencies, there may be a limited time period in which it is inappropriate for a habeas court to rule."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,293.657,295.526,"Well, let me just stop you there."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,305.132,319.807,"--No, what I was referring to were sort of the hypothetical of battlefield... somebody is captured... you know... and the next day or the next week from the battlefield, does he or she have the right to... does a habeas court have constitutional jurisdiction."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,320.724,325.045,"Putting aside the battlefield hypothetical, we're talking about Guantanamo."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,332.549,334.401,"--I don't think so, with respect."
2007.06-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.203,376.144,"But your basic position has to rest on Guantanamo Bay being just like if we had the detainees in, say, the Everglades."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,396.224,398.624,I wouldn't agree with that for two reasons.
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.27,448.774,Who says that... let's consider first the basis on which the court of appeals decided this case.
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,509.398,511.6,--The answer to that is a resounding yes.
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.6,512.433,What is... what are they?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,512.433,522.304,"They are the cases that were discussed and cited by the majority opinion in Rasul, and we have... we have added other ones to them, but it's showing--"
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.304,527.276,What cases... what case in particular do you think in Rasul?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,527.276,535.648,"--I think the opinion of two of the three law lords in the Earl of Crewe, which the majority cited as In re Sekgome."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.571,549.558,"Mwenya involved an English... an English subject, not an alien."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,549.558,550.808,"--Indeed, it did."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.808,552.427,The question there is an alien.
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,552.427,554.227,"Indeed, it did, and the government--"
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.227,555.16,So it's totally irrelevant.
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,555.16,561.014,"--Well, no... let me take a shot at convincing you that it's not totally irrelevant."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.096,588.267,"In both of those cases, it was a citizen, nonetheless."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,605.309,612.646,"--Well, the Court majority in Rasul cites a case involving the Isle of Jersey, the Channel Islands."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.498,623.104,"They were not regarded as part of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the crown's sovereign territory."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,623.104,625.104,"--I'll take one more chance, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.104,625.973,"Okay, try them."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,628.356,629.525,Okay.
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.146,669.483,"And the cases were decided under a statute that applied in India, not under... under the common law."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,696.133,718.316,"--Justice Scalia, as Lord Mansfield explained in the King v. Cowle, and both sides are citing to it... even if the writ... even with respect to the persons detained outside the English realm, the relevant question was, is this person under the subjection of the crown?"
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.553,736.711,"What is the relevance to your... this line of reasoning to the recent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which says that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the United States?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.87,756.607,"--Mr. Chief Justice, let me answer that question directly and then if I may finish my answer to Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,797.082,805.355,"So the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, it wouldn't matter where these detainees were held so long as they are under U.S. control."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,815.729,820.967,"No, I think, Justice Alito, I want to be as clear about this as I can be."
2007.06-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,892.779,899.417,"What if, in a future war, many of the soldiers and the opposing Army don't wear uniforms?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,914.826,919.713,"--Well, if they were in the United States, I think it's clear that they could file a habeas petition."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.439,1004.817,"So to determine whether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to go through a multi factor analysis to determine if the United States exercises not sovereignty, which you've rejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over a particular military base?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1014.09,1014.64,"Well, I don't--"
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1014.64,1022.679,"And that is a judgment we the Court would make, not the political branches who have to deal with the competing sovereignties in those situations?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1022.679,1034.336,"--You know, I think... both sides try to derive force from the fact that such claims, such habeas petitions, haven't come forward in floods in the past."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.954,1095.727,"Counsel, we had 400,000 German prisoners in this country during World War II."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1107.618,1109.502,"--Well, first of all, there is Colepaugh--"
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.502,1113.455,"And many of them were civilians, by the way, and not in uniform."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1115.455,1120.175,"--There's... there are Colepaugh, the Tenth Circuit case and In re: Territo, both of which we discussed."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.708,1147.843,"He claims he wasn't assisting the German army, just as these people here claim that they were not attacking U.S. bases."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1147.843,1174.427,--They were provided Article V tribunals that gave them actual notice of the government's facts and actual opportunity to controvert it and a determination by military officers who had not been told that both the commanding general of the southern command and the Secretary of Defense had personally reviewed the evidence and determined that these were enemy combatants; and a habeas court would simply dismiss.
2007.06-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1212.285,1217.523,"Your primary position is that we should order that they be released, is that correct?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1217.523,1220.891,"Well, we've asked that they be granted habeas relief."
2007.06-1195,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.186,1263.052,"Suppose there had not been a six-year wait, would it be appropriate then for us to... if you prevail... remand the case to the habeas court and instruct the habeas court to defer until the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has finished the DTA review proceedings?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1263.052,1267.106,--I would argue that the answer is no for two reasons.
2007.06-1195,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1277.477,1286.0,Why should I assume that the district court in Washington would be any faster than the court of appeals?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1286.0,1291.371,--Here's... the... the... let's take the cases in front of Judge Green.
2007.06-1195,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1396.99,1401.625,Why can't that take place in the CSRT review proceedings that are pending?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1401.625,1408.964,"Well, I don't... it could if the military had different procedures to govern the CSRTs."
2007.06-1195,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.741,1488.25,"Is that possible for your... let's say your six clients at this point or for any of the Guantanamo detainees, I guess, because wouldn't they all run into the problem of... the neutrality problem that you raised?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1499.641,1500.708,I certainly think so.
2007.06-1195,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.664,1509.18,I understand that.
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1509.18,1517.02,Where you don't have the convening authority exercising command control over the tribunal officer.
2007.06-1195,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.02,1522.604,"I'm just wondering whether assuming you win this case, that would be an appropriate form of relief."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1523.423,1524.139,I don't think it is.
2007.06-1195,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.126,1557.911,--I have a quick question.
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.029,1562.964,We'll give you your rebuttal time.
2007.06-1195,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1562.964,1573.336,"Going back to Justice Scalia's question on the precedent, suppose... and I'm going to be... I'd like my mind to be clear on this."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1658.276,1659.192,Yes.
2007.06-1195,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1659.192,1660.092,They are--
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1660.092,1661.775,I will cite two examples.
2007.06-1195,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.083,1756.903,"--The Spanish doctor, the Swedish doctor, the Spanish sailors, the British spy, they're all in this case."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1756.903,1775.131,"--Well, in this... in this country, In Re Felateau, which was decided only a few years after the founding, not only was he an enemy alien; he was granted release under the writ of habeas corpus because, not being a citizen, he could not be charged with treason, which was the basis for holding him."
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.131,1776.35,Where... where was he held?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1776.35,1778.352,I think in Pennsylvania.
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.568,1780.885,Are you sure he was being held in Pennsylvania?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1780.885,1781.537,--It was the mid-Atlantic.
2007.06-1195,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.504,1785.256,"I mean, you're being held within the jurisdiction of the United States."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1810.371,1822.531,"Well, Justice Scalia, you're asking me to discard the Indian cases, and I've... I've mentioned to you the cases that the majority of Indians in Rasul relied on, the Earl of Crewe and Mwenya."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.918,1842.008,"Mr. Waxman, this determination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation or control of non-sovereign territory, would, I expect, have diplomatic consequences."
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1870.512,1875.832,"My... I don't think it's in the record here, but what is in the record are the terms of the lease."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.666,1909.57,We... there are... am I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to the base and work?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1909.57,1912.005,"--I'm not sure whether there are, or not, any longer."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.014,1933.168,"So if you have two of those workers and they get into a fight over something, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1933.168,1937.756,"Absolutely not, and this is the key difference, I think, going to Justice Alito's question."
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1939.172,1944.91,What authority... what authority do you have for that: That such a suit would not lie in the Cuban court?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1944.91,1959.586,"--Well, first of all, the terms of the lease, and, second of all, I... I don't know that we cited... I mean, somebody has cited decisions of the Cuban Government, the judiciary and its executive, that they don't exercise any jurisdiction over--"
2007.06-1195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.586,1965.823,The converse question is: Could we prosecute a crime committed in Guantanamo by Cubans?
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1966.773,1993.74,"--The answer is certainly yes, and if I can just make the point about bases elsewhere, in Germany and Japan, for example, the status of... this is the only base, I believe, that... you know, in something other than an active war zone, that isn't the subject of a status-of-forces agreement that very specifically explicates both the judicial and executive authority over acts that occur on the base."
2007.06-1195,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.202,2019.039,"You're not heartened by the prospect that the detainees could apply to the Cuban courts, which would then hand process to the Commanding General at Guantanamo?"
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2019.806,2020.491,Not particularly.
2007.06-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.023,2049.058,I thought this was decided in Rasul.
2007.06-1195,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2070.491,2072.107,Yes.
2007.06-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2151.693,2152.293,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2159.048,2175.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since this Court's decision in Rasul, Petitioners' status has been reviewed by a tribunal modeled on Army Regulation 190-8, and Congress has passed two statutes addressing Petitioners' rights."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.751,2193.12,"General Clement, you said it was modeled after 190-8."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2195.487,2197.173,"Justice Stevens, it is virtually identical."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.222,2224.741,How is that personal representative chosen?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2224.741,2229.543,The personal representative is assigned to the individual by the military.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2229.543,2240.35,I mean is that personal representative also under an obligation to report back to the military anything that might be unfavorable to the person he is supposedly representing?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2240.35,2247.356,"Well, I don't know about ""unfavorable"", but I think if there's... certainly, if there is material intelligence information, he is to provide that information."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2247.356,2251.891,"So he's not... he is not in the position of counsel, as we understand the term."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2251.891,2252.208,No.
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.174,2278.975,"Under 190-8, does the defendant have a right to counsel?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2278.975,2281.677,"No, they do not, not under the basic regulations of that."
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2295.103,2298.889,"The DTA, see, is unclear to me, anyway, on this question."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2309.847,2318.202,"--Well, I... the way I would answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is this: In terms, the DTA does not provide for an order of release."
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2341.818,2351.774,"2243 doesn't specify the availability of release, either, but it has certainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas courts in this country."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2351.774,2352.157,No.
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2365.081,2365.866,"Yes, but that--"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2365.866,2368.549,The D.C. Circuit hasn't been shy about asserting that authority.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.52,2375.822,But doesn't the resort to the All Writs Act beg the question?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2397.685,2399.103,"""Uigars""."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.103,2413.847,"Who was one of what, 12 or 13, who was found not to be an enemy combatant, and the Government's position there was: Go back and do it again in front of another tribunal, another panel, which, in fact, conveniently found that he was."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2420.934,2422.536,"Well, I would disagree, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.722,2452.105,Okay.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2474.568,2487.228,"--Well, again, Justice Souter, what I would say is simply this: that if what the Constitution requires to make the DTA to be an adequate substitute is the power to order release, there is no obstacle in the text of the DTA to that."
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.747,2520.882,They get additional process.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2593.247,2595.73,I'm not sure that he could make that argument.
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.73,2596.282,Exactly.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2596.282,2597.482,I'm not sure he can make--
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.482,2607.924,"If he cannot make that argument, how does this become an equivalent to habeas, since that happens to be the argument that a large number of these 305 people would like to make?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2607.924,2620.398,"--Well, Justice Breyer, let me take it this way, which is, of course, you're getting to the gravamen of their claim, which is that the DTA and the review provided in the D.C. Circuit is not an adequate substitute for habeas review."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2685.924,2688.459,But aren't you simply rearguing Rasul?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2688.459,2689.026,Not at all--
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2689.026,2691.011,We have passed that point; haven't we?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2691.011,2692.161,"--Not at all, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2709.706,2713.091,"It... it... it wasn't, and I didn't want to get into the prisoner of war point."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2729.036,2729.986,"With respect, Justice Souter--"
2007.06-1195,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2729.986,2747.665,"General Clement, I remember in a prior hearing about Guantanamo that the Government was taking the position firmly that these detainees were not prisoners of war and, therefore, were not entitled to the protection of the Geneva conventions."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2757.536,2766.392,"--Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter... because I think it gets to the same point... we are using ""prisoner of war"" the way that the common law courts use the term ""prisoner of war""."
2007.06-1195,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.392,2771.53,Is the Geneva Convention modeled after the Constitution of the United States?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2771.53,2772.446,"No, it--"
2007.06-1195,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.446,2776.267,"What it means by ""prisoner of war"" is the same thing that the Constitution means?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2776.267,2782.854,"--Well, and... and... with respect, the Framers in 1789 had the benefit of the three Spanish soldiers and the Schiever case."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.921,2791.944,"And the three Spanish soldiers were... were ultimately found to be prisoners of war, And, yet, they had process to get into court."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2795.995,2798.18,"The writ was denied, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.18,2799.68,The relief was denied.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2799.68,2800.615,"No, the writ was denied."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2800.615,2802.751,That had a hearing under the writ.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2802.751,2804.151,They did not have a hearing.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2804.667,2808.738,"Then how did the court ever come to the conclusion that, in fact, they were prisoners of war?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2808.738,2811.69,--Because it said that... it looked at the pleading in the petition.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.661,2826.783,"On their... on their own showing, but, in fact, the proceeding did not end until the court had come to that conclusion."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2833.02,2835.472,"It didn't even ask for a return, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.955,2841.959,On the basis of a Government claim formally or informally proffered to the Court.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2868.61,2870.896,"--There is authority for that proposition, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.006,2946.527,"Well, was that because they were reflecting 1789 practice, or because they were reflecting the Defense of the Realm Act?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2948.146,2952.598,--I think it is a pretty good snapshot of where things were as of 1941.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2952.598,2958.851,"Unless you can answer my question, we don't know what the snapshot proves."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2958.851,2961.803,They were exercising habeas jurisdiction.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2961.803,2973.111,"They were exercising habeas jurisdiction in a court... in a polity in which Parliament is supreme and Parliament had already passed the Defense of the Realm Act, and I don't... I mean it."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2984.502,2986.604,"I think we do have an answer, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.473,3050.963,I thought we were here talking about... I see that you have a strong argument and they'll have a strong argument in reply.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3137.235,3145.425,"--As Justice Souter pointed out... I mean, if you assume that the statute also said any review for that claim should be in the court of appeals, not in the traditional--"
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.425,3145.891,Correct.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3171.742,3184.883,"--Well, Justice Breyer, as I say, I think that if you accept that there would be some deference to the ability to bring statutory claims, I don't know why that deference would be limited to the substance and not to the forum."
2007.06-1195,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3196.691,3203.361,"If the Court holds that the DTA is not an adequate substitute for habeas, what will happen?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3221.156,3225.46,--The government will certainly take the position that they are not entitled to those things.
2007.06-1195,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.14,3253.194,"General Clement, if we had to either charge or release these people, what would they be charged with?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3262.566,3264.502,"--Not as such, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.572,3275.643,"As I understand the government's position, these people are not in uniform, so they're not an under the law of war."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3286.448,3289.467,"--Right, and the ones that actually killed somebody would have committed murder."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.467,3291.002,That's right.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3296.139,3301.877,"They don't qualify for prisoner of war status, but just to be clear I think certainly when the British cases are talking about--"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3301.877,3302.627,I'm talking about common law.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3306.929,3308.864,--They would not qualify for prisoner of war status.
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3309.781,3316.118,Their engaging in war-like acts would be the crime of murder or the crime of assault and so forth and so on.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3320.089,3321.689,--That would be our theory in those cases--
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.689,3322.706,--I mean it is your theory?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3322.706,3328.008,--That would be our theory in those cases... and it is our theory in those cases we've chosen to prosecute--
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.008,3328.41,Right.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3328.41,3355.845,"--in the military commissions, but there are other individuals with respect to whom we don't have the right kind of evidence in order to go with the full-blown military commission trial, but we still have the option that this Court recognized in Kirin and Hamdi and most particularly in Kirin, not just to try people who are unlawful combatants for their unlawful combatancy, but also to hold them as we would hold anybody else who was captured as preventative detention."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3355.845,3359.13,"For the duration of hostilities, if you can show that they are enemies."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3359.13,3364.033,"Well, I think if we can show that they were enemy combatants, that's exactly right."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3364.033,3369.604,"And you are operating today under a broader concept, as I understand it, of ""enemy combatant""?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3369.604,3370.921,Than?
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3372.473,3379.143,"Than was indeed the case for example in our early litigation, let alone at the time of Kirin."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3379.143,3380.16,"Well two things, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3421.62,3426.106,"But how can... and this again, maybe I should know the answer to this, but I don't."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3434.112,3435.314,"--No, it does not."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.88,3446.935,"You mean... you're saying if it gets to the court of appeals, they can raise the constitutional claim that the definition is broader than constitutionally could be enforced."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3447.871,3449.004,"--That was in my points, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3449.754,3455.977,"I didn't understand that point when you were having your colloquy with Justice Breyer, either."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3472.653,3473.52,"--Yes, Justice--"
2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3473.52,3476.455,--that's provided in the MCA.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3476.455,3477.391,--It absolutely is.
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.859,3483.378,It wasn't cleverly redrafted.
2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3526.572,3527.289,But the statute--
2007.06-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3527.289,3527.973,They are arguing it.
2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3527.973,3529.941,--But the statute talks about standards.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3541.833,3553.557,"Well, I think, again, that Justice Breyer's hypothetical, as I understood it, sort of assumed away the adequacy of all of the standards and just said: Putting all of that to one side, I have some other constitutional claim."
2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3588.378,3605.074,Just one more question on that point: Would the Court of Appeals in... under the MCA have the authority to question the constitutionality of the definition of noncombatant... of unlawful combatant?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3605.074,3606.39,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3608.825,3626.337,"General Clement, I thought your answer to Justice Breyer... and maybe I'm missing something... would be that there is a third alternative which he didn't consider, namely: That these are combatants picked up on the battlefield, and they may be detained indefinitely without proving they committed a crime."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3628.105,3629.622,That is our position.
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3641.513,3649.452,You have a hypothetical claim that a particular prisoner says: I was kidnapped by people who were not in the United States Army and sold for a bounty.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3667.08,3668.866,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3694.731,3697.099,"Let me interrupt again, and I know your argument."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3706.239,3709.157,"--It's a preponderance standard, and that's what is set forth in the statute."
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3720.865,3728.287,"--I suppose any challenges to the adequacy of the standards, or whatever, are the sort of things that would be raised in the D.C. Circuit."

2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3755.305,3760.359,"Isn't the main issue the fact that it has taken six years to have the issue resolved... ""relevant""--"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3760.359,3762.359,"--Well, I mean--"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3762.359,3767.263,--They say they have been unlawfully detained for six years from the beginning.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3773.433,3780.003,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think the delay is going to be relevant to whether or not courts should expedite hearings, and the like."

2007.06-1195,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4072.161,4074.78,"Our opinion says have a nice day, everybody."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4076.882,4082.202,You can't win without reversing the Court of Appeals.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4082.202,4087.087,--You can certainly affirm on alternative grounds.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4087.087,4096.01,"If we affirmed on alternative grounds, leaving the court of appeals' reasoning as it stands, these interesting questions that you referred to will never arise."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4096.01,4097.962,"I don't think that's right, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4120.475,4132.099,Is that because the withdrawal of jurisdiction does not apply to review of the proceedings in the D.C. Circuit that's provided under the statute?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4143.224,4144.192,That's exactly right.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4144.192,4152.362,Why would they litigate that adequacy if they have determined in advance that substantively the individuals who are petitioning have absolutely no rights?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4152.362,4153.981,"They hadn't decided that, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4178.264,4188.72,"At the end of the day, the only thing, as I understand it, that could possibly be adjudicated would be the question of formal adherence to procedure or not."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4205.414,4224.06,"--Well, Justice Souter, I'm not sure that this Court... I understand your question, I believe, which is that the D.C. Circuit, I think, almost unavoidably reading this Court's Rasul decision and reading it as a statutory rather than a constitutional holding, has stuck with its circuit precedent and said that there aren't constitutional rights here."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4246.324,4258.132,"You were arguing that the question of the adequacy of the substitution should, in fact, be litigated in a plenary fashion in the Court of Appeals or the district court for that matter?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4258.132,4258.599,No.
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4262.184,4268.939,I thought you said a moment ago that there were all of these interesting questions that could be explored if there was a remand?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4268.939,4270.856,"--I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I may have misspoke."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4270.856,4271.825,Maybe I misunderstood you.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4271.825,4289.17,"The interesting questions that I think are left on the remand, no matter what, are issues about whether or not based on the Abraham declaration that the military followed their own procedures for assembling the record below, or whether the military followed its own procedures for providing exculpatory evidence."
2007.06-1195,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4295.424,4299.026,You are talking about in effect about evidentiary procedural questions?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4299.026,4299.476,--I mean--
2007.06-1195,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4299.476,4310.666,"You're talking about taking the statute, Congress's statute that set up this system with limited review in the D.C. Circuit and saying that's it."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4346.174,4347.875,"--I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1195,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4370.922,4376.459,That would be... we would be deciding that as a court of first view because they didn't decide that?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4380.597,4384.065,"I think that's a fair observation, but obviously this Court--"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4384.065,4384.832,General Clement--
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4384.832,4393.837,"--In the context... I mean this has been fully briefed in, and in the context of where the Court uses an alternative ground for affirmance, it would not be a novel situation, I don't think."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4393.837,4399.391,"--General Clement, your suggested reason why they're right is quite different from the reason they actually gave."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4403.51,4412.732,"I think that's a fair point, Justice Stevens, though I would say that really their reasoning encapsulates one of the three reasons why at common law they were right."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4412.732,4417.786,"Yes, but they did not reach this very important part of the whole case."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4428.51,4449.491,"Oh, that's right, Justice Stevens, but in fairness, in those situations you were dealing with sort of substitutes for core habeas under situations where they're was no dispute that there was a robust right to habeas at common law, and so here you first deal with the situation of... all right, the baseline is, as Judge Friendly suggests, 1789, is this an adequate substitute?"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4463.584,4471.054,And you say those later cases are not relevant because habeas corpus in the modern world is much broader than it was in 1789.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4472.022,4472.956,That is part of our point.
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4472.956,4473.472,Yes.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4473.472,4474.156,"And we would say, though--"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4474.156,4484.08,"And the comparison you ask us to make is between what the habeas writ was in 1789, not what the comparison to a habeas writ would be today?"
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4484.08,4490.568,"--We would start with that proposition, but I think this isn't a case where it's just 1789 versus today because as I read this... 2--"
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4490.568,4501.626,I don't think you would seriously contend that the procedures set forth in the statute are equivalent to those afforded under the habeas writ under today's jurisdiction?
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4501.626,4503.459,--It's a hard question for me to answer... 8--
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4503.459,4504.242,At least you haven't argued that.
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4504.242,4509.03,"--Well, no, but I mean the question is, you know, in a different case, sure, there would be a different habeas."
2007.06-1195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4532.928,4538.649,"On the point I made, I think that's critical to your argument that the substitute is adequate."
2007.06-1195,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4538.649,4540.334,--I think that's right.
2007.06-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4618.434,4619.536,"Thank you, General Clement."
2007.06-1195,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,4622.036,4622.655,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4776.737,4783.575,"That is an argument that, I gather, both sides agree is available to you under the DTA before the D.C. Circuit."
2007.06-1195,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,4783.575,4784.458,--That is absolutely correct.
2007.06-1195,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4808.959,4811.76,What does that tell you about the adequacy of the substitute?
2007.06-1195,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,4811.76,4840.162,"--Because the D.C. Circuit... because the D.C. Circuit is reviewing a record that was adduced ex parte, in camera, with a presumption to boot that it is... that the evidence is both accurate and complete, and the D.C. Circuit is... has already said it will not hear any new evidence and it must apply that same presumption that that evidence that was heard ex parte in camera with its own presumption is correct."
2007.06-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4994.145,4995.297,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
