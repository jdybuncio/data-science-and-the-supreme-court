1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.641,"After lunch, we will take up argument in 71-315, Deepsouth Packing Co. against the Laitram Corporation."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,16.12,19.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-315,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,149.505,153.153,"Counsel, is there any issue of validity here at all?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,153.153,160.32,"This Court has refused certiorari Mr. Justice Douglas, with respect to the questions presented on validity."
1971.71-315,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,160.32,161.33,It is purely infringement.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,161.33,166.12,It's purely the infringement question as posed in my opening statement.
1971.71-315,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,255.274,256.389,On what page is that?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,256.389,266.483,"That's on page 122 Mr. Justice Douglas, or 120, essentially the same picture shows in both."
1971.71-315,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,277.479,283.481,"I have to have a copy of Appendix, part of which is printed in one way, another is in upside down."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,283.481,285.986,"Oh, I am terribly sorry, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1971.71-315,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,289.87,292.653,Get me another one.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.068,297.827,Could I get a patent on that?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,297.827,298.596,"Well, I think so."
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,301.491,310.484,"While you are stopped, it will help me, if you would explain why this is relevant to the problem of assembly versus non-assembly?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,310.484,324.895,The reason being Mr. Chief Justice that this court has been very explicit in saying that a combination of old elements presents a particular problem and all of the elements here are old.
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.436,348.777,We are all clear.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,348.777,359.779,"Now if I may invite to court's attention to Page 7 of our Blue brief, petitioner's Blue brief."
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.166,456.387,"If you will help me again counsel, if you would tell me why is this basic problem any different from what it would be, if it were a typewriter involved with the same issues you have here namely the assembly problem or an automobile or dishwasher?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,456.387,464.255,"Probably no different if I understood Mr. Chief Justice, that the typewriter's parts were all old."
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.007,498.243,(Inaudible) that's the end of this whole defense?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,498.243,514.534,"No I wouldn't take that position at all Mr. Justice White, if the bolt is a resided element this court's decisions and particularly that in the (Inaudible) case, say clearly that all resided elements in a combination claim are critical."
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.527,528.849,"So the but as long as one set, but one resided element is not assembled?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,528.849,531.5,That is the law of this Court as I understand it.
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,812.788,822.552,"I am sorry to interrupt you right there but would it make any difference, if it were not assembled for the first time, if it had been assembled and then disassembled?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,822.552,834.827,"If it were first assembled Mr. Chief Justice, and then disassembled, the first assembly would concededly constitute an infringement, because the invention would be made within the United States."
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,849.574,855.353,This is what the Fifth Circuit thought was the artificiality in part.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,855.353,860.181,"That is correct and of course, we differ with Fifth Circuit very vigorously."
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,868.123,885.721,"But do you see no artificiality in a different rule, applied to a situation where they would assemble a typewriter or the washing machine to see if it would function and run it through quality control tests, and then disassemble it and go through the process?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,885.721,891.172,"No I do not, because those are the rules of our game, and I don't think they are artificial."
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,895.415,902.598,"I guess that's what the Fifth Circuit disagreed with you, or they didn't regard this as a matter of rules of the game."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,905.4,911.842,"Well, they went in not to the decisions of this Court, they were not even looked at, they were ignored."
1971.71-315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.48,941.192,"Well Mr. -- Mr. Birch, I think the Fifth Circuit regarded this thing as a subterfuge, and you can cite 20 cases and the impression remains in my mind that it still is a subterfuge."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,954.757,956.339,We are coming to that.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.491,1018.565,Why don't you exempt sales abroad of the assembled merchandise.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1018.565,1021.001,I don't think -- I think they are exempt.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.923,1024.657,Right.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1024.657,1027.676,"If they blew -- you mean, if they’re assembled in the United States--"
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.676,1032.858,"They’re assembled, but they are assembled when everybody agrees they are assembled to be sold only abroad."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1032.858,1034.439,Yes.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.439,1037.954,No entry in the United States market.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1037.954,1045.267,"Because our law which as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, if it's there, we have to content with it or reverse it."
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.82,1113.741,I understand your latest argument that you would relegate the patentee to foreign patents to protect himself?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1113.741,1115.673,I think that is his responsibility.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.322,1149.03,"Well except the juror that the impelling rule is your clients, not the patentee, is it not?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1153.154,1157.432,Well there is no reason for our client to do anything in the absence of a Brazilian patent.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.895,1171.068,That was my next question.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1171.068,1171.351,Yes.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.351,1172.955,Whether there was a Brazilian patent.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1172.955,1180.544,"There is, and I have the complaint here in both Spanish and English, I cannot read the Spanish."
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.544,1186.386,"Of course, the only way for the patentee to protect themselves would be to get a patent in every country in the world?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1186.386,1192.808,"Well not necessarily, because shrimp show up in relatively few countries around the world."
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1431.884,1463.028,"Mr. Birch, as I was reading the briefs in this case, I was hearkened back to the earlier days of my fatherhood when I used to spend the Christmas eve, sometimes a ball night and end up with a lot of bruised thumbs having purchased what I thought was a coaster wagon and come in a box, and instead of a coaster wagon there will be a lot of parts, that was up to mother and father to assemble."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1487.247,1488.087,Not at all.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.684,1499.294,"Well, I might be infringing, when I put it together, but how about the person who sold the box of the disassembled parts to me?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1499.294,1503.212,The Statute is specifically designed to take care of precisely that.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1503.212,1504.353,He would be a contributory infringer.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1504.353,1507.603,He would be a contributory infringer under 271 (c)
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.603,1509.388,"C, but he would not be an infringer in your submission, is that correct?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1509.388,1519.086,It would not be a -- but the same remedy would lie and the same recovery against the same defendant would be obtainable.
1971.71-315,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.101,1525.307,Difference between a direct and contributory.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1525.307,1531.217,"Yes, the difference between direct and contributory is semantic as long as what occurs --."
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1531.217,1536.093,I would be the infringer assuming that I could ever get the thing assembled which --
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1536.093,1537.817,"Yes, you too would be an infringer."
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.817,1540.531,And I would be the only direct infringer on the --
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1540.531,1556.398,That is correct but as has been pointed out in respondent's brief there is a rather strong policy in this country not to go around suing and the courts do not favor suits against individuals who would be in your position with the bruised fingers.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.828,1562.466,But the seller or the manufacturer of those disassembled parts would be contributory infringer --
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1562.466,1564.577,He would be a contributory.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.577,1567.802,He would be in the United States and that's the only difference between my typical case and yours.
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1567.802,1576.719,That is correct and he could be sued and full recovery got from the man who manufactured and/or sold the parts.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1613.487,1616.242,Does Deepsouth have in the United States?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1616.242,1620.86,Deepsouth has one very small factory.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.86,1628.562,"That it assembled in that factory, all of these devices that are sold in the United States market."
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1628.562,1638.665,Everything that is sold by Deepsouth is made in one small building and I believe there is a total workforce of four or five.
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1638.665,1639.826,Four or five individuals?
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1639.826,1640.727,"Individuals, that is correct."
1971.71-315,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.727,1651.62,"But for the United States market the three elements you mentioned are assembled, put together in that factory for all sales in the United States?"
1971.71-315,0,26517,harold_j_birch,,1651.62,1655.763,No the completed device is not put together.
1971.71-315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.627,1709.503,You may.
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1726.409,1731.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-315,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1760.49,1762.229,That's a second decision.
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1762.229,1765.455,That was the second decision in the Radio case.
1971.71-315,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1765.455,1769.52,And are the Fifth and the Second Circuit judge all to this --
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1769.52,1788.909,"Yes the Fifth, the Fifth Circuit put it very concisely saying that the District Judge followed the Second, Third and Seventh Circuits and then he said in the next sentence what he did not know was that we would refuse to follow and went on from there."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.564,1812.495,"Do you think there's something in our case that within the case that if there are three elements making up the combination, two of them are manufactured here and one of them abroad, that there was no infringement, if the two that are made here are sold in this country or shipped abroad?"
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1812.495,1817.256,"There is no Supreme Court case on that particular point, Your Honor."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.256,1820.091,Not even relevant to what a combination of patents do?
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1820.091,1830.923,"Well, there are cases interpreting combination patents but always in terms of the technical question of whether or not the claim for the patent read on the machine and operation or read on the substance."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.923,1835.009,Well in the event like this there would be no infringement --.
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1835.009,1844.775,"Well, there might possibly be contributory infringement but the facts of this case are fully not developed to answer that question."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.887,1871.724,And that's here with the combination.
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1871.724,1884.55,"Well, in this case it would be a machine, Your Honor, because there are four types of things which are patentable inventions and that is set forth not in any of the parties briefs that are at Page 94 of the Appendix, the statute is set forth."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.94,1926.266,But it has to a patentable invention come up with --
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1926.266,1942.138,"A patentable invention, that's correct Your Honor, and but the invention, the word combination does not appear in the portion of the Patent Statute that defines patentable invention."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.138,1945.805,But these three elements alone wouldn't be a patentable invention?
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1945.805,1947.656,If they had never been put forth --
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1948.093,1949.88,Put together before.
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.88,1951.482,Would they?
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1951.482,1953.739,"They would, if the man had in his mind, the idea of putting --"
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.739,1957.06,This couldn't file the patent obviously --describe these three items.
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1957.06,1957.622,"No, you cannot."
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.622,1960.469,Never say anything about how they are going together and what they are going to --
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1960.469,1967.614,You have to describe a cooperative relationship among the elements in order to obtain the patent.
1971.71-315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.614,1969.497,If the elements are old?
1971.71-315,1,26047,guy_w_shoup,,1969.497,1975.345,"If the elements are old or new, as a matter of fact, you got to describe some sort of relationship at any time."
1971.71-315,2,26517,harold_j_birch,,2627.968,2630.536,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.71-315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.925,2735.644,And unless somebody makes it in the United States you say there can be no contributory infringement.
1971.71-315,2,26517,harold_j_birch,,2735.644,2737.869,"That is correct, that is clear from Aro (ph)."
1971.71-315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2755.925,2758.475,"Thank you Mr. Birch, thank you Mr. Shoup."
