1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.667,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1873, Guy Adams v. Charlie Frank Robertson."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,35.934,44.202,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.765,105.67,"Mr. Waldrop, you are here before the Court asking this Court to decide a Federal due process issue, and whether the Federal Constitution requires an opt-out provision for plaintiffs in the class, is that right?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,105.67,106.221,"Yes, that's correct."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.221,120.541,And can you show us today or point to a place in the record in this case where that issue was raised by you before the Alabama supreme court?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,120.541,120.911,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.144,126.166,The blue brief.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,126.166,127.366,--The blue brief.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.366,128.978,At page 21.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,128.978,130.937,"Twenty-one, we start our discussion--"
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,130.937,133.64,Are you talking about the blue brief in this Court or in the other court?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,133.64,133.891,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,138.004,140.175,I'm just asking you what document you're referring to.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,140.175,140.345,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.345,144.997,"Is there some document we can look at in the record here before us, or--"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,144.997,145.207,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.207,147.14,--are you referring to something--
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,147.14,147.32,--I'm--
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.32,150.132,--that isn't in the briefs but would be in the record?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,150.132,153.194,"--Well, I'm referring to the briefs to the Alabama supreme court."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.194,155.906,And would they now be in the record before this Court?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,155.906,156.306,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.306,158.097,"Okay, and can you tell us--"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,158.097,175.678,"If you start on page 21, and then on page 23 of our brief we state that the minimum due process requires that class members be given the right to opt out, to exclude themselves from the class, and there we begin talking about the decision of Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.678,181.673,"--Well, what were the questions that you raised, the legal issues and the claims in the Alabama supreme court?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,182.694,183.832,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.832,185.304,You raised three issues.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,185.304,185.885,"--Yes, we did."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.885,197.592,And one of those issues was that because there was no opt-out provision for the class it violated the Alabama constitutional right to a jury trial.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,197.592,199.765,We did argue that before the Alabama supreme court.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.765,199.995,Okay.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,201.606,202.687,That was one issue.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.687,214.685,"And there were two others, but neither of them appeared to me on reading them to raise a Federal due process violation like the failure to have an opt-out provision."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,214.685,248.406,"Well, we felt like we raised it with sufficient clarity, because, for example, the respondents' brief, both class counsel in their very first... the class counsel raised it as one of their statement of issues, and then, when you would look at their brief, for example, in their summary of argument, their very first page starts out by saying the mandatory class and class action settlement on a no-opt-out basis was proper and does not violate constitutional guarantees."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.406,254.42,"All right, but we do know, I guess, or will you concede that the Alabama supreme court did not address this issue."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,254.42,254.811,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.811,257.052,"Do you, yes or no?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,257.052,258.344,"--Well, they--"
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.344,259.415,Did it or did it not?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,263.396,272.541,"--No, the Alabama supreme court did not directly address the no-out, opt-out issue in regard to due process."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.541,272.892,Right.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,272.892,282.359,"They did cite the Shutts opinion, but they cited it merely for the fact that a class action was a type of joinder."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.084,310.008,And you did not raise it in any of your claimed issues before that court.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,310.008,319.946,"Well, we felt that we did because of our subheading on page 23 of our brief, when we stated that minimum due process required the right to opt out."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.946,325.72,So you refer us now to pages 21 and 23 of your brief to the Alabama supreme court.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,325.72,326.18,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.172,328.844,Was your brief that specific?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,345.107,347.147,"--Well, what we said--"
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,347.147,348.649,"Well, were you that explicit?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,348.649,355.664,"--Well, we were explicit in saying it violated due process in citing the Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum case."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,355.664,362.027,"No, did you expressly say, the lack of the opt-out does not violate Fourteenth Amendment due process?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,363.749,363.97,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.97,364.508,--in page 23?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,366.981,368.011,--Exactly.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.011,369.003,Or vice versa.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,370.765,378.97,"Well, we stated it in our head note, Justice Souter, when we said minimum due process requires an opt-out, and then we were discussing--"
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.97,383.585,"But I mean, that... all I want to know is that statement, minimum due process requires an opt-out, was in your brief?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,383.585,383.944,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,383.944,384.204,Okay.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,396.555,401.947,"Well, we're making the argument here that Shutts requires an opt-out."
1996.95-1873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,401.947,403.758,"Yes, but you never raised that point."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,452.365,456.349,"Well, two things, Justice Breyer."
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.532,474.732,But it certainly didn't in Shutts.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,474.732,491.004,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum does, in fact, say that absent plaintiff in fact refers to residents and nonresidents."
1996.95-1873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.004,498.849,"But it doesn't say that in the brief, and moreover, the clause you didn't quote says it's our view that it has to provide minimal procedural due process protection."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,513.52,523.216,"Well, our view is that on page 23, when we said in our head note about minimum due process, we were referring across the board."
1996.95-1873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.967,526.208,Is there a word in the brief anywhere that says it's across the board?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,526.208,530.642,"--Well, only the head note, Justice Breyer, on page 23."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.973,575.86,"Well, let's just suppose that we don't agree with you that it dealt with non-State residents and furthermore that we conclude that the question you want this Court to address on the Due Process Clause and an opt-out requirement for residents of the State was not cleanly presented by you below, and that the Alabama supreme court did not address it."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,588.027,608.323,"Well, we, of course, believe it would be a prudential concern, because we believe that the Alabama supreme court did not want to look at Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum because in our situation we had objectors who were nonresidents."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,675.486,681.34,How many members of this class were from out of Alabama?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,681.34,690.977,"Well, we have... the objectors, the petitioners are 543 people, and we have 30 petitioners who are nonresidents."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,690.977,692.84,"But you have 400,000 in the class."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,692.84,718.155,"That's correct, and... well, as far as being nonresidents, that particular number was not available to us, although we know that these policies were sold in seven or eight States, so we know that the number has to be in the ten of thousands of nonresidents, because when the class was certified in Barbour County it was... it covered all the States, and the problem was, that was one of the problems in the Barbour County Circuit Court."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,750.177,756.63,How many claims for money damages of this type have gone to judgment in Alabama?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,763.295,767.579,--There were... there have been two cases that have gone to judgment.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.52,783.323,"But that was upset, wasn't it?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,788.244,791.837,"Well, there were two cases that actually went to a jury verdict."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.652,803.736,"And in any of the individual cases that have been brought so far, have any of those sought anything other than monetary relief?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,803.736,812.063,"There were 32 cases outside the class when the class was certified on March 10, 1993."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.217,821.587,How about the two that were... there were two brought by class counsel.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,821.587,831.363,"Class counsel filed on behalf of five individual clients, and in each one of those there was a claim for money damages."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,873.283,886.853,"When we look at that, as we do after the fact in a case like this, should we bear in mind which of the fraud damages can be satisfied out of these special funds which have been set up?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,886.853,893.288,"--Well, Justice Souter, these special funds were declared to be punitive."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,893.288,902.124,"Well, regardless of how they might otherwise be characterized, and I want to hear what you say, but is it at least a subject that we ought to look to?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,902.124,908.499,We think the most unreliable thing to look to is what was settled.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.098,910.58,"Okay, but how about the answer to my question?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,919.529,920.408,"--No, sir."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.408,920.838,Okay.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,932.866,933.887,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,946.457,950.878,But how... I think that's up to what the individual wants.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,996.28,1017.444,"--Well, no in this sense, that the remedy... the Alabama courts have held in regard to fraud in regard to an insurance policy, they have held numerous times that you can affirm the contract and sue for money damages, or rescind the contract and sue for money damages."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.698,1037.132,"Well, in particular, punitive damages."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1037.132,1037.9,In particular.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.9,1055.683,"Now, what is your response to the argument from the other side that punitive damages are not substantively anybody's entitlement, and it's really up to the State to decide the conditions in which they may be available, and if the State class action rules don't make them available, that's certainly within the power of the State to decide?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1056.834,1061.278,"Well, Alabama law appears to us to be in conflict."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.212,1083.895,"But that's a question of State law, it's not a question of Federal due process, isn't it?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1083.895,1084.366,--Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1084.366,1086.058,Even on your own argument.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1087.918,1088.149,--Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.149,1091.201,It's just a question of State law whether it be constitutional or statutory?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1091.201,1094.286,"--Well, no, sir, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.005,1106.094,Who is it vested in?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1106.094,1106.284,--It may be taken away from--
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.284,1108.417,You were just talking about the punitive side of it.
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1131.332,1156.497,"--Well, all... what I was saying is, in Johnson v. Life of Georgia, in response to Justice Souter, was in that case they said that once you got the award they could take half of it away and give it to the State, and so I really think Alabama law there is saying that constitutionally you have the cause of action, and it's discretionary with the jury as to whether or not you can... whether or not you get punitive damages."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.821,1168.036,"--Well, I wish I knew more about Alabama law, and one reason I don't is because the Alabama court never addressed any of this stuff."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1177.086,1178.367,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.367,1200.63,"--which requires that the issue... final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant, and I guess that... the issue is whether that means is drawn in question here in the petition for cert, or was drawn in question in the State court."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1200.63,1201.04,--Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.04,1202.831,Is that the distinction?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1202.831,1204.443,"--Well, yes."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.182,1212.528,"Let's assume it means in the State court, and therefore let's assume that our cases that have dismissed some of these cases are all based on discretionary judgments."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1229.769,1239.675,"--No, sir, because we felt that this issue was, in fact... we had been raising the opt-out from the very beginning."
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.675,1258.218,"I think Justice Scalia's question is, assuming that we were to decide that you did not properly raise it, and the question then is, is it jurisdictional so we must dismiss this petition, or is it prudential, and he says is it a good prudential reason that you did fail to raise the question before the supreme court of Alabama?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1258.218,1261.739,"Well, we believe certainly that it is... it is not jurisdictional."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.232,1265.883,"Mr. Waldrop, it's an important question."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1288.679,1298.597,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the class counsel's brief they in fact stated it as an issue presented, and so we believe--"
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.597,1300.749,Which brief are we talking about now?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1300.749,1306.522,"--Well, we're talking about the brief, Appellee Charlie Frank Robinson."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1309.584,1311.267,A brief in the Alabama supreme court?
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1311.267,1311.607,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.265,1329.028,Isn't that referring... I've already asked this--
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1396.234,1407.51,"--Well, Justice Breyer, all I can say is that we felt like, starting on page 21, that we had raised it, and we felt like we had made that argument, particularly by our head note."
1996.95-1873,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.095,1430.798,"May I ask you one question on the merits, which I... which I... how we get to this."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1480.553,1510.633,"--Well, yes, and for this reason in Alabama it would be an unliquidated claim, and it would... that would be the case everywhere, but secondly in Alabama if the settlement fund in the class was sufficient to punish the defendant, then opting out would serve you no good under Green Oil v. Hornsby, because if you opted out, if there was already a sufficient fund, the Green Oil curtain would come down in Alabama."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1522.462,1524.952,"Well, isn't it true that it doesn't have to be all one thing or another?"
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,1543.094,1546.376,"--There is in Green Oil, v. Hornsby."
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.11,1599.402,"Very well, Mr. Waldrop."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1601.455,1606.628,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.194,1632.917,"You mean a statement of issue at the beginning of the brief, Mr. Roberts?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.917,1638.67,"Yes, Your Honor, and there was also a subheading to make it clear what the constitutional issue was."
1996.95-1873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.67,1655.841,"Do you know, Mr. Roberts, what happens if the Alabama supreme court sees a Federal constitutional issue when the briefs have been presented to them in the fashion you describe, and the Federal constitutional issue is not... what does the Alabama supreme court do then, do you know?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.841,1657.243,I don't know as a matter of practice.
1996.95-1873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1659.995,1660.185,Of course.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.185,1663.247,"--Could be presented here, but it quite clearly did not do that."
1996.95-1873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.247,1667.791,I take it under their rules they're free to go ahead and address it if they see a Federal constitutional issue.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.791,1687.493,"Yes, Your Honor, which I think partly explains the reason it was in the respondent's briefs before the Alabama supreme court, because it was decided by the trial court in Alabama, and since we went ahead and addressed it because it certainly couid have been addressed by the Alabama supreme court, but that doesn't cure the appellant's failure to raise it properly before the Alabama supreme court."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1687.493,1694.967,"Did... you did bring up Ticor Title I think, didn't you, in your... in a long footnote in your brief?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.967,1695.327,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.451,1701.842,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1701.842,1710.029,"--because the trial court did, because that doesn't cure... and the Alabama supreme court is certainly free to say, under our rules we're not addressing any such question because we don't see it presented."
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.029,1718.524,"Mr. Roberts, I think the respond... neither... one respondent made no response to the petition of certiorari."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.648,1724.999,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.68,1727.991,And so what do we do about that?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.991,1731.264,"--That was a mistake, certainly, not to file the opposition--"
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.264,1731.434,"Oh, indeed."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.674,1733.818,--and not to mention it in the one that was filed.
1996.95-1873,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.59,1742.473,"Could you address that question, whether it is jurisdictional or prudential?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.795,1749.386,"--Well, it... it did, and then it sort of stepped back away from it."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.058,1819.954,"A prudential reason on the other side, on the other hand, Mr. Roberts, is that our own processes make it important that counse do raise these problems at the outset, and the fact that it wasn't raised in the brief in opposition frankly induces me to say that as a prudential matter, if we're going to be serious about our demands that these issues be presented in the BIO and prevent the waste of our time, we should say whatever prudential considerations there are on the other side has been washed out--"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.954,1820.325,Well--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.325,1823.017,--by the failure to raise it in a timely fashion.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1823.017,1836.537,--I don't think the federalism concerns and the Alabama supreme court's opportunity to address the validity of its rules in the first instance under the Federal Constitution should suffer simply because of a mistake by counsel in not filing an opposition to certiorari.
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.537,1840.419,"Well, Arizona can, you know, after our opinion on the merits, should we find--"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1859.614,1872.032,"It's... well, it's also a concern for this Court in its decisional processes just to make sure another reason, prudential, for having a requirement that the issue be raised is that a full record be developed on that."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.964,1893.335,"--Well, it was raised at the trial level."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1893.335,1906.914,"It was raised at the trial level, but we don't know precisely... and again, the Alabama supreme court could have a different construction of its rule, and the claim has evolved or changed as it's developed."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.438,1935.175,"Mr. Roberts, at least as the question was presented to this Court, and I think as Mr. Waldrop stated it in Court this morning, they are not raising opt out just for nonresidents."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1953.158,1953.428,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1969.847,1973.209,What is the argument that it would be jurisdictional?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1973.209,1976.603,"I think it's based primarily on... well, a number of things."
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.802,2008.366,"Mr. Roberts, do you think Michigan v. Long cuts either way on this issue?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2008.366,2010.016,"No, I don't."
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.53,2019.091,Because they clearly refer to the Alabama constitution here.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.091,2020.513,They relied only on the Alabama--
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.513,2023.854,So you'd say if Michigan v. Long is implicated it was complied with.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.854,2024.455,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.239,2036.834,"We sometimes grant, vacate, and remand in light of new congressional statutes, in light of the decisions of this Court."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.862,2056.507,"Well, the State courts, of course, can always address the question in another case, the next case that comes along."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.53,2073.089,I don't think you understood Justice Kennedy's point.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.915,2111.446,"I'm not familiar precisely with the practice in the cases you're thinking of and whether they apply in the State court system as well as with respect to Federal courts, but I would agree that if there's no... if it's not a question of, there's some confusion, you don't know if you addressed it or not, then yes, if it's jurisdictional there would not be authority--"
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.446,2115.007,"Well, I'm not sure that's consistent with the Court's practice prior to Michigan v. Long."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.499,2118.9,--Oh--
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.9,2123.405,--and I think it would have the power to do that even if the ultimate decision is there's no jurisdiction.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.405,2133.981,"--I... yes, if the basis for action is that the Court is uncertain whether it had jurisdiction, but if it is clear that it does not because there... it's not a question of an ambiguous--"
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.981,2148.45,"But on the other side of the coin there, Mr. Roberts, at least in Newsom v. Smyth which you cite, and other cases, I think the practice of the Court has been to DIG, to D-I... dismiss as improvidently granted rather than to dismiss for want of jurisdiction when this problem arises."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2148.45,2149.011,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.916,2154.146,Correct.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.062,2164.935,--And it is... and it was expressly recognized as an open issue.
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.935,2165.225,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2165.225,2166.565,--whether it was jurisdictional or prudential.
1996.95-1873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.565,2166.725,Correct.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2166.725,2186.189,"My point is simply that one, we think it's jurisdictional for the... at least for the reasons given by Justice Story, and if not, the prudential reasons cut strongly against deciding a Federal Constitution, particularly concerning the validity of State court rules, when the State supreme court has not had an opportunity to address that question."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.443,2230.678,"Mr. Roberts, if that's what Alabama had done... and it sounds to me like things States do all the time."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2281.122,2286.526,"The procedure, the mandatory class action, depends upon a representative plaintiff coming in and invoking it."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.101,2301.207,"Well, at least the two that were begun the day before this complaint was filed, shouldn't they have... shouldn't Alabama have said, okay, now we have... we have a representative action going."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.579,2305.782,"Well, that's in fact what happened with those suits."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2310.134,2312.826,So there are no individual suits going forward now?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.826,2315.299,There... none going forward now.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2338.696,2356.628,"Now, I can understand saying that, but it does seem to me that class counsel would be taking inconsistent positions if at the same time that he's putting people, even people who don't want to be in this pot, there and saying, but I have my private clients and I'm taking care of them."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.628,2364.184,The concern in each of those cases was that... the particular members in the two suits that you're referring to were former officers of Liberty National.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2429.121,2448.171,"Mr. Roberts, I don't think anybody is questioning that there was notice and there was an opportunity to come in, but what does seem strange is a person who says, I've got this insurance policy that I acquired because the company was fraudulent."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2468.454,2477.82,"Well, I can certainly understand that reaction, but the question is not whether any individual class member had that reaction, but what was appropriate relief for the class as a whole."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.806,2497.515,"So we have a new rule now of Federal... well, this is State procedure... the greatest good for the greatest number, and the fact that some people who would have had perfectly good individual money claims, that's too bad."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.515,2497.886,No.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.702,2533.499,"But Mr. Roberts, the trial court did not have the Alabama supreme court's affirmance in the McAllister case, and that's--"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2533.499,2534.29,It did not.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.29,2540.754,"--Now, at that point, Liberty National has been found fraudulent."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.216,2573.857,"No, not in this instance, because--"
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.857,2574.167,--Why not?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.167,2581.862,"--The evidentiary record that was developed in the subsequent case was quite different, and the allegations were broader in the second case."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.862,2584.403,I'm not talking about your case.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2606.988,2607.467,No.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2641.09,2651.418,"But each individual in this $400,000 class didn't have the opportunity that Edith McAllister had to show what their situation was, what the agent said to them."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2651.418,2652.467,"No, and they never would."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2659.265,2662.508,"My hypothetical was, they're modest people."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2664.04,2673.597,"--The question, when you're trying to decide whether the relief under the class that the class is given is equitable and monetary is, what is the appropriate relief for the class as a whole?"
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2705.099,2708.0,So it is the idea of the greatest good for the greatest number.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.665,2731.318,"--Oh, well, with respect, the circuit court decided that it couldn't be."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.889,2745.47,So what else is new?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.552,2747.964,"--Well, that doesn't mean it's the most--"
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2747.964,2749.103,That most often happened under common law.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.103,2755.037,--And the State of Alabama can decide that we think it would be better to bring everybody together in one proceeding and--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.037,2758.39,"Well, that's exactly the issue, whether it can."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.39,2768.046,"--and the question... this is a due process claim, not whether the settlement was fair, although we think it was fair, but the question is, were petitioners afforded due process before their claims were resolved in this manner."
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2768.046,2785.818,"Well, may I ask in that connection, going back to Justice Ginsburg's conclusion that it's the greatest good for greatest number analysis, what would have happened if Edith McAllister had not sued first and had in fact objected to a class certification covering her?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.76,2791.123,Her objection that she had received individual notice of the proposed settlement--
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2791.123,2792.002,Could she have gotten out of the class?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.002,2792.553,--No.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2795.636,2814.348,"So that despite the peculiarity of her facts, which I thought you were telling us justified the special or the separate treatment, if her timing had been different she would have been in the same boat with everybody else and those special facts, in fact, would not have justified anything but the greatest good for the greatest number."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.348,2816.569,--They were covered by the release in the settlement.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.329,2821.313,"No, but if she didn't... that's the... yes, but--"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.815,2824.657,--No--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.657,2828.67,And doesn't this go to the accuracy of the definition of the class?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2836.407,2837.118,--I didn't mean to suggest--
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.118,2837.508,--we're treating you all alike?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.508,2839.581,--I didn't mean to suggest that they were peculiar claims.
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.368,2847.719,I see.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2847.719,2848.928,--on the class claims.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.14,2852.483,"But the ultimate fraud and the ultimate damages, those were common."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2855.225,2855.886,--Absolutely.
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.362,2872.996,"The fairness of the settlement really hasn't been raised by these petitioners, has it?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.996,2881.953,"--No, but it is... their attack on its fairness seems to be the main basis on which their claiming a due process violation, and again, I agree--"
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2881.953,2892.541,"I thought that the main basis, and Mr. Waldrop confirmed this, was that they can't be made to relinquish a claim for money damages without an opportunity to opt out."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.541,2897.746,"--If... that is their claim, and it has no basis."
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.037,2934.304,"That may be different in Alabama, because this is all rules, and the Worker's Compensation and the other things we've been talking about, bankruptcy, these are highly statutory."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2966.914,2973.93,--The issue is whether the procedure that they've been provided under these rules comports with due process.
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2982.074,2985.537,Would your answer be different if we were talking just about the Rules Enabling Act?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.93,3008.753,I don't think this is abridging or modifying a substantive right.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3013.517,3021.042,What if the State of Alabama had simply removed... had eliminated the action for fraud against insurance companies?
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3022.824,3023.295,Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3023.594,3026.057,"So if it can do that, a fortiori it can do this?"
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3026.057,3033.631,"--I don't want to make a bitter-with-the-sweet argument because that doesn't work in procedural due process, so I don't think that that lesser--"
1996.95-1873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3033.631,3037.875,"Well, it would really convert this into something other than a procedural due process case."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.875,3047.398,"--Yes, and the point I want to emphasize is that here, as far as procedural due process goes they had notice and opportunity to be heard, and the complementary protections of the class action rules."
1996.95-1873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.398,3059.777,"And you would say, Mr. Roberts, that the State could abolish that cause of action for fraud not only by legislation but by judicial decision if it chooses to operate that way, and that that wouldn't violate due process."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3059.777,3061.95,Certainly it would not violate due process.
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.95,3070.015,"Well, certainly there's nothing in the Federal Constitution that requires Alabama to distribute the powers of government the same way that the Federal Government does."
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.346,3074.657,Separation of powers rules don't apply to the--
1996.95-1873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3074.657,3074.877,--Yes.
1996.95-1873,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.905,3095.77,"--I think your question highlights again a reason that... a prudential reason the Court shouldn't reach out and decide the issue, because we don't know how they would have addressed it in this instance because it wasn't presented to them."
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.803,3145.715,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,3148.329,3161.997,"Well, we believe that a cause of action, a fraud cause of action, this Court had already said in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank back in 1950 that a cause of action is a constitutionally protected right."
1996.95-1873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3277.533,3277.543,"Thank you, Mr. Waldrop."
1996.95-1873,0,37340,norman_e_waldrop_jr,,3278.814,3279.966,--Thank you.
