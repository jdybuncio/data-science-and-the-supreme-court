1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.628,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-5916, Richard Demarest v. James Manspeaker."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,61.793,73.871,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5916,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,93.906,96.287,This was a convicted State prisoner?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,96.287,103.754,"--That's correct, Your Honor... for the time that that person spends in attendance at a court of the United States."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.687,175.791,Do you mean when the witness... the United States would pay the fee in this case?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,175.791,176.54,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.54,180.824,"What, because, what... that's because of this provision of 1825?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,180.824,181.933,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,197.894,201.076,And when does it say the witness shall be paid by the United States?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,201.076,214.574,"In a case in which the United States is a party and the, the... in the case of a witness for the United States by the United States; in the case of a defense witness when the fees cannot be paid by the defendant or the party."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.574,217.486,"And this was, this was a Federal trial in the, in the district court?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,217.486,218.548,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,220.608,221.48,Mr. Scarboro?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,221.48,221.86,--Yes?
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,221.86,228.986,If it's an ordinary witness does he pay his own travel or does somebody pay his travel?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,228.986,243.074,"No, in the ordinary case, Your Honor, if a person is going to serve as a witness in a case and the parties are able to pay the fee, you tender a witness fee and travel expenses to the witness when you serve the subpoena."
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,244.113,245.606,A fee plus travel.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,245.606,246.327,That's correct.
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,246.327,249.709,"Now, in this case the Government paid travel?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,249.709,253.03,In this case the State of Colorado or the United States Government.
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,255.383,256.392,"Well, he didn't pay it."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,256.392,256.983,That's correct.
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,257.844,258.723,Who paid his food?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,258.723,262.927,"It was paid by the Denver County Jail, I assume."
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,264.019,265.719,So the county jail fed him.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,265.719,266.69,--That's correct.
1990.89-5916,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,266.69,269.153,So his out-of-pocket expenses were zero?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,269.153,270.283,That's correct.
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.425,305.065,--May I ask you... was he a defense witness or a prosecution witness?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,305.065,305.726,"Defense witness, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.726,306.627,He was a defense witness.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,306.627,315.303,Mr. Demarest made his application to the clerk and the clerk referred the request to the assistant United States attorney.
1990.89-5916,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.9,353.798,"Mr. Scarboro, the Government says that a witness has to be subpoenaed under the statute before he can be deemed to be in attendance under the terms of the statute."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,353.798,355.06,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.387,416.029,But section 1825 uses the term subpoena?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,416.029,416.59,"Yes, yes, it does."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.436,465.57,"Well, are you, are you now arguing that a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum is a subpoena within the meaning of this section?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,465.57,466.622,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.631,469.955,So we're getting a little bit away from pure plain language now.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,469.955,472.216,"--Yeah, well, Your Honor, perhaps we, we are."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.216,472.546,Yeah.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,472.546,477.078,The word subpoena also appears in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedures 17(a).
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.205,488.826,What do you say with respect to a volunteer witness?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,488.826,494.028,"Your Honor, I would say that a volunteer witness ought to be paid."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.851,496.94,"Well, maybe he ought to be but the statute requires it--"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,496.94,497.882,"--In, in--"
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.882,498.823,--because he's in attendance.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,498.823,509.149,"--In my view, Your Honor, the... in the first place, it's not necessary to answer that question in order to decide this case we submit, because Mr. Demarest did appear pursuant to a formal procedure."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.91,510.531,I see.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,510.531,515.854,"--issued an order that gave him oversight, judicial oversight over the proceedings."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.861,533.154,"What does... what does in attendance mean in, in that event."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,552.268,571.6,"--This is, this Court has held that in attendance in Hurtado, the 1973 opinion from this Court which is the only case construing section 1821 that in attendance refers to the time spent in readiness to testify while the trial is taking place."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.6,579.815,"So if you choose to come 5 days early, so long as the trial is going on at that time, you're in attendance."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,579.815,582.96,"As you know when you're trying a case, Your Honor, some... you may subpoena--"
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.96,582.987,Right.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,582.987,584.579,--witnesses for the opening day of trial.
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.23,586.38,Sure.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,586.38,587.981,--you may subpoena them for the opening day of defense.
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.467,615.337,"Well, the technical arguments made by the Government weren't made below, were they?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,615.337,616.318,They were not.
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.3,654.516,"Well, the respondent can, the respondent can ask the Court to decide a case on another ground."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,654.516,656.049,--The respondent can always--
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.049,657.238,If the record does... supports it.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,658.678,658.868,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.83,668.925,--A respondent is also expected to raise any nonjurisdictional objections to reaching the question presented in the motion... the brief in opposition to certiorari.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,668.925,672.989,"That's correct, Your Honor, and it was not raised in the brief in opposition to certiorari."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.989,675.66,If we construe--
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,675.66,675.92,"It seems only... excuse me, sir."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.92,693.082,"--If we construed subpoena to mean only subpoena would that... and imposed in effect the subpoena requirement as the Government argues, would that be consistent in every respect with the practice which is actually obtained?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,693.082,699.176,"It depends on what you mean by the practice, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,701.086,704.559,"I think you probably know more about that than I do, so I'm going to let you define that."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,704.559,713.835,"--Okay, the Government has taken the position, at least with regard to prisoner witnesses, that there... that they do not ever pay the fees of prisoner witnesses."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,715.055,716.908,Regardless of who calls them?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,716.908,719.189,"--Yes, that's my understanding, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.189,719.559,Umm.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,719.559,730.405,"If you mean the practice as employed by the courts under rule 17(a), the rule of criminal procedure, that, that by which courts issue subpoenas."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.386,763.868,"What other, what other process would it be for a person?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,767.749,769.882,"--It might be a writ of habeas corpus, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.882,771.652,"--Oh, then they'd be comparable to this--"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,771.652,772.033,Yes.
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.033,772.593,--if they're in custody.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,772.593,773.094,And then--
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,773.094,775.396,But not if they're in a private mental institution I don't suppose?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,775.396,776.006,--Probably not.
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.006,776.427,No.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,781.78,783.711,"I don't either, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.892,787.483,Correct.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,787.483,799.712,"For example, in the case of a witness who was detained because he's unable to post a bond for his own trial which is coming up and is then subpoenaed for it or is compelled to attend as a witness in another trial."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.169,811.78,"Well, you raise an interesting question... what about the defendant in his own trial?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,814.244,815.513,--The defendant--
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.513,815.884,I don't think he does.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,815.884,819.387,"--in his own trial is, is, I would say he's in attendance."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.387,820.827,But they've never paid them fees.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,820.827,821.528,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.675,841.339,You say that the... when a defendant is testifying the defendant is not a witness within the meaning of the statute?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,841.339,845.473,"That's correct, Your Honor, not with the meaning of 1821."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.243,894.805,"Cost, Mr. Scarboro, in the sense of loss of income and that sort of thing?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,894.805,895.045,--Yes.
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.421,908.676,"The, the... don't witnesses get some sort of reimbursement for... for travel?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,908.676,921.682,"Yes, they do, Your Honor and subsections (c) and (d) of section 1821 deal with the situation in which you can... a witness is entitled to receive actual reimbursement for certain kinds of transportation and entitled to an allowance--"
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.682,922.773,Subsistence.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,922.773,925.945,--A subsistence allowance depending on other needs.
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.945,938.524,"But here what, which of the purposes, if any, of having a witness fee was incurred by this defendant?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,938.524,939.906,That... I--
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.906,941.847,He wasn't out-of-pocket in this instance.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,941.847,954.475,"--That, that's, that's what I wanted to turn to, Justice White, and the point is simply this, that the Government says it wouldn't serve any purpose to compensate a person like Mr. Demarest."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.933,1076.296,"Mr. Scarboro, how do you... what is your explanation of 1825(a)?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1099.701,1102.272,It's not clear from section 1825 at all.
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.272,1103.384,Which is peculiar.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1103.384,1110.598,"Yes, it's very... section 1825 is... has got a lot of problems if you look at a variety of situations."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.345,1128.369,"Yes, well, I, I would say that is some indication that a witness who is not subpoenaed is not to be paid fees period since there's no provision for how they're to be paid."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1136.366,1145.992,"That's possible, Your Honor, but it seems to me that the main point ought to be what is intended by the use of the word subpoena in this statute, in, in section 1825."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.827,1187.41,"So we should construe 1825 according to its purpose, but not 1821?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1187.41,1190.109,"--I don't think you should construe 1825 at all, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.676,1198.056,But--
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1198.056,1199.045,All the Government--
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.045,1206.592,"--But we could nonetheless take it into consideration along with 1821 if we feel it's relevant, I suppose, in deciding the question presented."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1206.592,1207.293,--Certainly.
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.732,1237.64,"Mr. Scarboro, would I be helping you out if I suggested that 1825(a) was directed not to the question of who gets paid, but to the question of who has to issue the certificate, which is a condition precedent to being paid and that, and that it is with respect to certain defense witnesses subpoenaed that there is a distinction made about the issuance of the certificate as evidence for the payment and that that's the only thing that 25(a) is directed to."
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1237.64,1240.933,"That is a possible reading of section 1825, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.933,1243.396,Can you think of a better one from your side right now?
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1243.396,1245.197,"Certainly, it sounds so to me, Your Honor."
1990.89-5916,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1245.197,1245.728,Okay.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1245.728,1262.247,"I want to underscore, it... that this Court in Hurtado... the Government... one of the cases, the principal case the Government relies upon for its, its definition of the word in attendance is Hurtado against the United States."
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.216,1327.34,"Mr. Scarboro, did Mr. Demarest think up this claim by himself?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1327.34,1329.931,"Yes, he did, Your Honor, he thought it up all by himself."
1990.89-5916,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.144,1343.321,"And there... has, has ever... has a prisoner ever been paid a witness fee?"
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1343.321,1358.67,"Yes, actually prisoners have been paid witness fees and there's a 1939 comptroller opinion in which the United States Marshal paid 3 prisoner witnesses a fee and then got into trouble getting reimbursement."
1990.89-5916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.67,1360.863,We'll resume at 1:00.
1990.89-5916,0,32803,james_e_scarboro,,1379.043,1382.957,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1831.297,1836.991,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.578,1866.481,"Excuse me, there, there was an instance as I record where they received a witness fee, three of them in the, the--"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1866.481,1871.186,"--Yes, in 1939 the Marshal's service mistakenly provided witness fees to convicted prisoners."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.186,1877.41,"--Or correctly did so and did, and did not do so mistakenly in all the other instances, as the case the may be."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1877.741,1889.657,"Well, we think that, we think that you should not write off this practice as nothing more than one of the longest running violations of a statute's plain meaning in our legal history."
1990.89-5916,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.691,1958.402,I suppose that--
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1958.402,1959.214,Excuse me.
1990.89-5916,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.214,1962.035,--Why do you read that much into the phrase in attendance?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1962.035,1968.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, we read the statute in that way for a number of reasons."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1997.861,2001.023,"Well, Mr. Lazerwitz, may I ask you two questions about that?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2031.912,2036.905,"It's a sound, but one that we don't agree with for these reasons."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2070.739,2091.751,"Well, what I'm, what I'm suggesting is that the procedure that 1825 addresses may well be simply a procedure for distinguishing some witnesses who cannot be paid without the certification of a public defender or a clerk of court as opposed to witnesses who may be paid on certification of a United States Marshal."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2091.751,2102.139,"Well, that's true because in 1825(a) you'll notice that there's no provision for paying... when the Government subpoenas a witness the same requirements don't obtain."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.139,2127.184,"So, I guess what that... well, that leads to my second question and that is on your reading, which if I understand it correctly is that there must a subpoena before a defense witness may be paid, that would still allow the payment of a defense witness... I'm sorry, that would still allow for the payment of the witness fee to a prisoner called by the Government, wouldn't it?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2127.184,2130.496,"No, and let me explain why."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.123,2204.369,"Well, fair enough, but the administrative practice issue is the, is really a separate argument."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2219.556,2222.771,"Well, our textual basis is in 1821, which is in attendance."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2224.04,2239.271,"But you're then, as I understand it, you're defining in attendance by reference to the process by which the person comes into attendance and that's why you place the emphasis on the need for a subpoena for a defense witness as indicated in 1825."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2239.271,2240.591,"--That's, that's part of it, Justice Souter."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.758,2255.93,"Then, then why don't you forget 1825 completely."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2255.93,2262.755,Because we think 1825 supports our position and helps understand what in attendance means in 1821.
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.755,2282.659,"Yeah, but if 1825 is supposedly reflecting your theory of what in attendance means, you've got to face the fact, haven't you, that 1825 only refers to defense witnesses, by which I assume they mean witnesses called by the defense, which would lead you to the conclusion that a prisoner called by the Government would get paid and a prisoner called by the defense would not."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2282.659,2288.502,"If all we were relying on were section 1825, then your point would be well taken."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.923,2342.257,"Did it ever put a subpoenaed witness, quote and unquote?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2342.257,2342.968,"No, Justice Marshall, no."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.968,2345.049,"Well, don't you need that for your argument?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2345.049,2347.27,"It would make it easier, but we don't think we need it."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.27,2347.781,Don't you need it?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2347.781,2349.032,It would help.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.032,2351.004,The statute just says witness.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2351.004,2352.964,The statute says witness in attendance.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.964,2354.416,And witness is witness.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2363.122,2365.132,"Well, one of the reason's why we think it's not that--"
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.132,2365.833,Is it not?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2365.833,2367.532,"--Yes, that's true, Justice Marshall."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.532,2368.794,And nobody called him.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2370.775,2374.348,And he would not be entitled to receive the fees under our position.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.348,2375.279,"Why not, under your rule?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2375.279,2376.379,Because he again--
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.379,2376.969,Why not?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2376.969,2382.052,--and going back to the hypothetical that was raised this morning before lunch.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2396.324,2397.984,We're not talking about parties.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2400.506,2402.448,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.378,2421.339,Where did he... where did you get that out of the statute?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2422.931,2424.671,--It says witness in attendance.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.671,2427.042,You know what a witness is and I know what a witness is.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2427.042,2427.903,"Yes, I do."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.903,2429.563,And everybody in town knows.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2457.813,2459.493,"I don't know either, Justice Marshall."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.493,2459.994,All right.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2459.994,2473.214,"The fact that there's been this consistent practice requires us... consistent practice, not just administratively but from the courts and through history, suggests that there's something more going on here."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.214,2478.387,"Mr. Lazerwitz, is, is the practice consistent as... with your entire theory?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2486.382,2488.034,"No, and let me--"
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.034,2488.681,Ah.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2488.681,2493.036,"--let me clarify this, the apparent preoccupation with subpoena."
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.036,2495.387,That's your preoccupation.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2495.387,2495.868,"No, it's not."
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.002,2541.436,"Well, is it the same if the defendant calls up his friend and says, come on down and testify for me and he shows up?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2541.436,2543.729,He would be a witness.
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.641,2556.379,"Well, your answer is that wouldn't be process that you're talking about even though he just uses the phone like the prosecutor does."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2556.379,2564.113,"--If that case occurred, I would imagine that the witness would be able to be paid, but there would be... he would have to have--"
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.113,2565.994,Despite 1825?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2565.994,2569.887,"--Well, he wouldn't be paid unless he received the subpoena."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.239,2576.11,You like your witnesses and you don't like the defense witness.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2576.371,2577.811,"--No, Justice Scalia, it's not that at all."
1990.89-5916,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2596.524,2603.587,And why is it that a writ of habeas ad testificandum isn't a form of compulsory process?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2603.587,2613.313,"It is a form of compulsory process, but it's not... there is a difference between a writ and a subpoena and what was said this morning was somewhat misleading."
1990.89-5916,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2637.561,2671.782,"Well, I don't see why that's so critical when you get back to figuring out what in the world 28, 821 means and you haven't come to grips I think with the provisions in 1821 that say for example a subsistence allowance shall be paid to a witness other than a witness who's incarcerated and down in subsection (e), an alien who has been paroled and so forth or is deportable is ineligible to receive the fees."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2676.297,2685.482,"Yes, and we think that the way to read the statute and the way, the way we read the statute is to look at (a)(1) and (d)(1) differently."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.909,2720.094,"You say he's, he's not in attendance unless he's subpoenaed except that, that if he's a witness for the prosecution he doesn't have to be subpoenaed."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2726.048,2726.759,No.
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.759,2728.95,It means subpoenaed unless it's a prosecution witness?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2728.95,2736.694,"No, the meaning of in attendance refers to the process by which they're summoned and that you make yourself available by complying."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.694,2740.117,But you say that you don't have to be summoned at all if you're going to be a witness for the prosecution.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2740.117,2741.659,"Yes, you are summoned, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.958,2756.118,It just takes somebody to call me up and summon me?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2764.224,2767.306,"No, it's... if you don't have the subpoena, you can--"
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.306,2767.837,Right.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2791.761,2793.251,"--Yes, Justice Marshall, and--"
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.251,2795.222,And that makes good sense to who?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2795.663,2803.129,"--Well, we think it makes good sense because that's what Congress has enacted and that's the way it's been since 1792."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.129,2808.793,"Mr. Lazerwitz, may I ask you a specific question about subsection (d)(1)?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2830.595,2831.627,Yes.
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2831.627,2837.29,"If that is so, then why isn't the exception other than the witness who was incarcerated a redundancy?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2837.29,2839.053,Again--
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.053,2841.714,Because it would never apply to such a person.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2841.714,2846.807,--A witness who was incarcerated... if--
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2846.807,2851.762,"Because we have a separate subsection for the witnesses who are detained, so--"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2851.762,2851.89,"--Yeah, we--"
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2851.89,2865.649,"--so this, I assume, can only apply to a witness who is incarcerated as a prisoner or otherwise and it seems to me that on your reading the exception is redundant because such a witness would never be in attendance."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2865.649,2869.54,"--That's one way of reading it, Justice Souter."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2875.755,2884.401,"No, but I, I guess my problem is I don't see how I can accept your theory of what attendance means without finding a redundancy in the exception."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2884.401,2892.548,"Well, there's another, there are other witnesses, potential witnesses who need to be excepted under (d)(1)."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2910.33,2917.012,"Well, on your theory didn't he start out in attendance but once he gets committed to jail on the unrelated charges, he is no longer?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2917.012,2926.429,"Well, he is in attendance in the sense that he's, he has complied with the process, he has been summoned, but he's not entitled to the subsistence allowance because he finds himself in jail."
1990.89-5916,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2926.429,2929.191,Okay.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2929.191,2937.555,"Again, the... under our reading of the statute, in attendance is critical and does make sense of the rest of the subsections."
1990.89-5916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.352,2947.723,"Mr. Lazerwitz, let me just go back to Justice Souter's question."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2970.989,2975.35,"--Well, that's, that's true, Justice Stevens, and again--"
1990.89-5916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.35,2983.707,"And also, why couldn't it also include volunteer witnesses who would not be in attendance under your... but you know you haven't really answered the question that was put to you earlier."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2989.671,3005.08,"--The hypothetical, the one I can think of that isn't so farfetched is the prosecutor's in court trying a case and at the luncheon recess a guy in the back of the room says, psst, I heard something or I know something."
1990.89-5916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.226,3016.339,I bet he normally gets the fee if he wants it.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3016.339,3027.565,"Well, in terms of real practice the... not to make it more informal, but there's... the distinction is pretty much, on the street, off the street."
1990.89-5916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.711,3040.314,I'm more interested in the volunteer witness for the defense.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3045.607,3049.108,"I think he would, probably in the sense that the same practice that the Government follows."
1990.89-5916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.071,3053.902,It seems to me that really under--
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3057.345,3061.976,"--Well, one example, Justice White, is the prisoners who aren't convicted."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.262,3102.526,"I don't know whether we've gotten it, but you admit that there's nothing in the legislative history that will help you?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3102.526,3105.748,"--Oh, I think there's quite a bit in the legislative history that helps."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3105.748,3107.34,Give me just a little bit of it.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3107.34,3114.473,"Again, in the... the earliest statutes spoke in terms of summoning witnesses, which by definition would exclude--"
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3114.473,3116.065,"Well, isn't... wasn't this witness summoned?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3116.065,3117.665,"--No, Justice Marshall."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.665,3122.109,You don't say a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum is not a summons?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3126.131,3128.482,"Well, actually that points to what--"
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3128.482,3129.744,You don't call that a summons?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3130.966,3132.476,--In the sense that it's process.
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.716,3147.556,--Isn't that kind of a subpoena?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3147.556,3149.399,"No, it's different."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3150.056,3151.709,"Well, you disobey one and you'll find out."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3151.709,3157.182,"--Yes, you will, but the prisoner doesn't even have that option unless he goes and... I--"
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.182,3158.732,"Well, then he's summoned."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3158.732,3165.057,"--He's... again, we are speaking... we are using words that on the one hand could be termed colloquial."
1990.89-5916,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3165.057,3165.768,I'm not.
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3185.52,3189.013,"In 1900, he drew that distinction."
1990.89-5916,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.013,3195.176,"He would surely have to have a subpoena, a habeas corpus ad testificandum to get... a subpoena wouldn't do it, I would think."
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3195.176,3210.317,"A subpoena would not and again that's... in terms of where the custodial status of a witness moves away from the convicted prisoner, we do get into a gray area of whether they're entitled to fees under the statute."
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.713,3224.757,"Well, do the DOJ, DOJ regulations cover this case?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3224.757,3234.323,"They do, but not in the sense that the... they're not... we don't rely on them as a law or for chevron purposes."
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.176,3247.04,"Well, that may be, but does the regulation... under the regulation this particular prisoner would not be entitled?"
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3247.04,3254.186,He would not be because the only persons in custody who are entitled to receive witness fees are the ones set out in the statute itself.
1990.89-5916,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.186,3256.066,How long has that regulation been in effect?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3256.066,3280.382,"It's only been... it's only been promulgated since '86, but that has been the Department's practice since, since we can document the practice from... this has been the practice from the 18th century and the practice... if you... the reason why the history is important is the idea of a witness isn't simply the testimony in court."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.309,3371.641,Do little children get the witness fees?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3371.641,3372.463,"Yes, they do."
1990.89-5916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3382.628,3386.932,Including children who are too young to work under State law I would assume?
1990.89-5916,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3386.932,3388.342,"Yes, including these."
1990.89-5916,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3466.083,3468.565,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
