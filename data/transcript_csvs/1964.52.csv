1964.52,0,34626,leon_hubert_jr,,14.387,20.219,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.52,1,16337,arthur_kinoy,,1778.407,1780.985,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,3600.983,3604.127,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3875.099,3892.559,(Inaudible) Judge Wisdom setting out the order reaction against the deterring intervention.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,3892.559,3893.03,Yes sir.
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3918.726,3921.049,Except that they return to the fact.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,3921.049,3928.086,"Well, they could -- nothing could be presented to the grand jury because of the District Attorney's hands, he was enjoined."
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3928.086,3934.234,Am I wrong that the judge might thought that the indictment subsequent to the attorney.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,3934.234,3937.735,"Mr. Justice Goldberg, that's completely correct."
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3978.113,3994.583,"Is it your statement in answer to that that you're saying that they're all practical purposes, criminal proceedings were under there that it has the power to enlist the -- the government proceeding is brought in the federal court, is that it?"
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,3994.583,3995.767,"Yes, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1964.52,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4106.778,4107.395,The same court?
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,4107.395,4109.59,Yes sir.
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4257.553,4261.977,What this Court has (Inaudible)?
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,4261.977,4269.28,The one you have -- there they asked for a declaratory judgment but declaratory judgment does not add to anything with the jurisdiction.
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4288.804,4292.524,But my question on declaratory judgment goes directly with this.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,4294.858,4298.137,"Baggett and Bullitt, Mr. Rogers is going to answer this further."
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4323.29,4324.532,(Voice Overlap) proceeding --
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,4324.532,4339.026,On a procedural part (Voice Overlap) there was no criminal -- there was no criminal proceeding in Bullitt versus Baggett and simply the entire issue is over the signing of an oath and if you didn't sign the oath perhaps there is a professor who will screw and you lose your job.
1964.52,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4376.5,4378.921,An overt -- overt law.
1964.52,2,31103,john_e_jackson_jr,,4378.921,4382.757,"Yes, originally it was in the Gerende case."
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5472.453,5475.153,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.52,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5560.137,5564.533,What is your definition of Communist infiltrated organization.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5564.533,5571.234,"Well, a Communist infiltrated organization has been discussed at some length in the federal statutes and litigation on this matter and --"
1964.52,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5571.234,5577.398,"Yes, but we don't -- we don't judge your statute by what the federal statute says, do we?"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5577.398,5579.881,"No, of course not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.52,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5598.793,5602.693,Then tell me what a Communist-front organization is.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5602.693,5615.413,A Communist-front organization under the rule of presumptive evidence in the statute is one which has been cited or otherwise identified by a committee of Congress.
1964.52,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5651.654,5659.508,But what organization was it that cited or identified that the Southern Conference has a --
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5659.508,5663.153,The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of United States Senate.
1964.52,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5663.153,5664.087,Subcommittee?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5664.087,5665.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.52,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5679.434,5680.421,(Voice Overlap) or the same as.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5680.421,5681.275,The same as.
1964.52,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5681.275,5681.959,The same as.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5681.983,5683.18,Yes.
1964.52,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5686.091,5689.886,"I know but not the same, the same edge."
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5689.886,5696.618,This is a question of the exact statement in the finding of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.
1964.52,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5696.618,5701.827,"Well, was it -- it was the one that named -- just another name for this organization?"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5701.827,5702.693,Precisely.
1964.52,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5702.693,5703.908,Is that what the holding was?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5703.908,5705.289,That's exactly what it was.
1964.52,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5741.254,5758.077,(Inaudible) before the State of Louisiana and that included the Southern Christian Leadership Conference?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5758.077,5765.398,The Southern Christian Leadership Conference has been cited so far as we know by no congressional committee and no federal authority.
1964.52,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5765.398,5767.09,What about the rule from the statute?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5767.09,5777.446,Our committee found that there were substantial influence on this group through the Southern Conference Educational Fund and we have what we think is adequate evidence of it in these exhibits that had been offered to the Court.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5777.446,5779.309,What does that make it?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5779.309,5779.987,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5779.987,5782.15,What does that make it?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5782.15,5784.499,We don't define it at this time.We have made no effort to define.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5784.499,5787.174,(Voice Overlap) substantially influence upon.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5787.174,5788.155,This is correct.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5788.155,5792.378,But that means nothing under the statute I gather.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5792.378,5800.611,"No, Mr. Justice and it doesn't really mean anything after this case because these people are not charged with being part of that particular group."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5800.611,5802.779,But they might be under the statute.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5802.779,5803.864,"I don't think so, no sir."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5803.864,5804.65,You don't think it is.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5804.65,5809.596,Because it does not fit this presumptive evidence rule which we've set forth in the statute.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5809.596,5819.062,"Well, those are -- are those the only organizations that are -- that are going to be a subject in the statute, just the ones that had been decided by some federal authority?"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5819.062,5822.517,This is true in regard to the registration portion of the statute.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5822.517,5824.975,"Well, that's the way it reads --"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5824.975,5826.642,"I'm sorry, I can't --"
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5826.642,5829.964,That isn't the way the statute reads.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5842.154,5845.921,"Well, that's the only thing -- the only criteria set forth in the statute."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5845.921,5853.217,At least you say when some organization has been cited that then there should no longer be any doubt in anybody's mind (Voice Overlap)
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5853.217,5854.197,Correct.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5855.803,5860.658,"If there were some vagueness or uncertainties before the citation, there isn't afterwards."
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5860.658,5862.273,"Correct, Mr. Justice."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5883.292,5884.902,They're both involved in the case.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5884.902,5885.463,"They are, yes sir."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5885.463,5886.305,Okay.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5886.305,5896.583,"When counsel suggest to the Court that a man can be put in prison for six years for belonging to a Communist-front organization, this is simply not so."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5919.354,5925.859,"Well, does that mean Mr. Rogers that something might be a Communist-front organization and not be a subversive organization or vice versa?"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5925.859,5926.748,That is correct.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5967.233,5969.687,Then -- but not necessarily by force or violence?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5969.687,5971.963,"Not necessarily, no."
1964.52,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5985.207,5996.643,(Inaudible)
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,5996.643,6005.366,There were two counts against defendant Dombrowski and three counts against defendant Smith and one count only on failure to register against defendant Waltzer.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6005.366,6013.55,"So that in this instance, the indictment suggest that this organization is both a Communist-front and subversive organization."
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6013.55,6015.659,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6015.659,6019.846,But you suggest that one maybe one without being the other.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6019.846,6021.895,"It may but in this case, that's not so."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6025.153,6030.808,"Well, if it does provide the application, what do you suppose the difference is -- it might be?"
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6030.808,6042.78,"Well, I would think that most Communist-fronts, if their work has led to the degree of overt act against the State would be a subversive organization."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6053.57,6056.213,Your law would catch those as far as registration is concerned.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6056.213,6057.504,It would.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6057.504,6061.245,You would be required to register even though you're a member of this study group.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6061.245,6069.462,If it were a Communist-front study group provable under the statute with the knowledge of the defendant that it was such.
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6069.462,6079.264,But it -- but it could be a -- it could be a Communist-front study group that fell far short of satisfying the definitions of a subversive organization.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6079.264,6082.07,"It could -- this is possible, yes."
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6091.474,6101.699,Do you suppose anybody would really or to really -- or to really expect anybody to know the difference between a subversive organization and a Communist-front organization just from reading the statute?
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6101.699,6102.248,"Well, Mr. Justice --"
1964.52,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6102.248,6103.483,Or that doesn't make any difference.
1964.52,3,32533,jack_n_rogers,,6103.483,6118.542,"I would suggest that when you get into some of the delicacies of the law in regard to self defense and things like this, we expect them to know it and we put them to the test in the Criminal Court and we apply the evidence to the case and submit it to the jury and let the jury decide whether or not they knew it."
