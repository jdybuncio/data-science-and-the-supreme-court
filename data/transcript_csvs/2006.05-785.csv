2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.045,We'll hear argument next in Carey versus Musladin.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,6.124,9.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,31.842,32.994,"Well, it went a little bit beyond that."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,49.564,51.547,"--An unacceptable risk, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,51.547,54.398,That's the criterion.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,54.398,57.71,"Well, the test has been formulated different ways--"
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,57.71,59.962,That's the way he formulated it.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,62.813,77.263,"--In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we need to answer is whether this practice, and there the courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,79.444,89.571,"That was the end point that they were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by referring to the unacceptable risk that improper considerations would come into play."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,102.998,105.89,--That certainly was a formulation of the test.
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.757,184.102,"Well, I suppose if the court of appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court rule, and we're bound by case A."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,198.892,203.905,"Well, Your Honor makes a distinction between a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases."
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.315,270.33,"To apply an opinion of this Court to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established Supreme Court law."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,274.501,275.602,That's correct.
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.602,281.296,"I mean, they're forced to decide it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either means this or that."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,288.012,291.982,Not by doing that.
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,314.398,320.453,We're looking under AEDPA at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,340.585,350.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the... the first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as this Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti."
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.104,370.405,Right.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,383.933,390.287,I believe that the habeas relief should not lie.
2006.05-785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.745,421.508,You are actually saying the answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would then review it de novo.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,427.733,429.373,--Yes.
2006.05-785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.897,437.989,You would not affirm... you would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,448.107,459.804,"Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming that the hypothetical is that the state court has misapplied, that the fair import has... they have misapplied the holdings of this Court."
2006.05-785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.804,460.445,Correct.
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,460.445,462.017,It misarticulated them.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,476.907,478.447,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.602,520.676,"We're concerned here with the court of... the role, if any, that a circuit court, that opinions of courts other than this Court have in determining whether law is clearly established."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,534.915,536.734,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.734,550.594,"So that the only thing... your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then that's the end of it?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,550.594,551.854,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,588.94,593.853,Suppose all of the... suppose there are five circuits.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,607.321,613.515,"If Your Honor is speaking only to the clearly established prong, my answer would be no."
2006.05-785,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.362,721.317,So would there be any difference if this had been a post-AEDPA... if the circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,721.317,724.448,"There would be a difference, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.956,770.55,"Can you tell us... let's assume for a minute that this case were on direct review, that we don't have AEDPA."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,784.248,790.502,"That is a test, the test, one of the formulations of it."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.289,802.741,"Well, but you should make it more specific for us."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,814.038,822.485,"Your Honor, it is an assessment of all the circumstances, that if you're a trial judge--"
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,822.485,826.146,"That... unless you want to go on, that doesn't help me."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,830.4,832.11,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.01,880.172,Why couldn't there be here?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,926.14,929.943,"--Your Honor, my answer is no."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.633,961.246,What about banners?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,962.766,963.858,I beg your pardon?
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.858,965.507,What would you do with banners?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,970.229,971.801,Banners?
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.801,972.402,Yes.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,974.213,977.214,"Your Honor, I haven't seen a case involving banners."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,978.096,980.157,I think I know why.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,985.06,991.824,"--And likewise, we don't see all the button cases where the buttons have been precluded."
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,991.824,1001.802,"Well, you also don't allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1009.716,1011.108,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.108,1015.599,"Maybe that's why we don't allow banners, because a courtroom is not the place for banners."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1015.599,1016.971,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.163,1020.174,Absolutely right.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1071.876,1073.068,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-785,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1073.068,1074.568,What do you want to say about that?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1077.18,1079.003,"--I understand, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1107.831,1109.611,I'm not so sure.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1123.381,1130.264,"Well, Your Honor, in this case, this case has... this Court granted certiorari on the question of application of the AEDPA."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.937,1137.049,We're exploring initially what the rule ought to be.
2006.05-785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.049,1140.772,May I ask this question?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1172.775,1187.084,"It could not follow this Court's dicta under this Court's statement in Williams v. Taylor that only the holdings, not the dicta, of this Court establish clearly... clearly establish Supreme Court authority."
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1205.737,1210.542,"You don't need to establish that rule, do you?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1216.466,1218.537,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1231.565,1250.828,"What if the button had said... the three buttons had said ""Hang Musladin"", would you say that there was not... there was not sufficiently clear law from this Court to find that practice unconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1250.828,1253.559,"Your Honor, it wouldn't change the clearly established prong."
2006.05-785,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1266.919,1270.22,Falls within the ambit of what?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1281.377,1284.44,"I can concede that, yes, Your Honor, that--"
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.44,1287.492,We both want to know why you say that.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1287.492,1291.353,"--Well, the question is objective reasonableness."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.834,1317.031,"Okay, but what are the... getting into the formulation, what are the impermissible factors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the ""Hang Musladin"" button?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1318.521,1323.466,"The ""Hang Musladin"" button, the impermissible factor first is the explicit message."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1329.3,1330.639,"Well, what's wrong with that?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1341.787,1343.539,"--It is an outside influence, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1346.321,1355.195,How different is it from the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the prosecution every day of the trial?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1383.564,1385.366,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.67,1395.041,All right.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1395.041,1396.453,It's a spectrum.
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1410.922,1416.806,"What about simply the facts that we have in this case, which I thought I was doing, maybe I wasn't clear about it, but the button is different."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1436.058,1438.949,I don't think it would be required.
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1450.729,1452.079,Is that a way of saying that it's required?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1456.891,1458.654,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1459.953,1460.374,Why?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1460.374,1479.788,"--Well, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out, three family members of the victim sitting in the front row, buttons or not, the buttons don't add... add little, if anything, to the three victim's family members sitting there grieving through a trial."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1482.429,1491.005,"I don't know whether they are grieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a button that says ""Hang Musladin""."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1491.005,1494.347,"--Your Honor, I submit that the sentiment is obvious to the jury."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1494.347,1495.319,Pardon?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1495.319,1499.741,"I would submit that that sentiment is obvious to the jury, that a juror--"
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1499.741,1502.122,They may not want him hung.
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.046,1506.125,I wish you hadn't said that.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1545.812,1552.064,"--Your Honor, I did not intend at all to suggest that that was a message from those buttons."
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.891,1564.132,"You said, you know, convict what's... or hang What's His Name."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1581.045,1586.188,"--That's, if any message, what the buttons conveyed in this case."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1596.163,1601.859,"Okay, assuming that explicit message, could habeas relief be granted in my hypothetical case?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1601.859,1603.698,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.698,1604.349,Why?
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1604.349,1618.678,"Because in your case, I don't think that that message necessarily... I think it is reasonable for a state court to conclude that those buttons did not add much to, if anything, to the presence of--"
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.678,1643.106,"Is it reasonable for a state court to say that three family members sitting in a courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of days the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so and so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that it should, and may consider in deciding guilt or innocence?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1643.106,1646.237,"--Your Honor, we could concede that for this case."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1646.237,1646.506,Okay.
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.771,1665.659,I thought some states require that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their case to the jury for harsh penalty.
2006.05-785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.335,1673.784,That's at sentencing after conviction.
2006.05-785,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.784,1674.125,"--Yes, yes."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1674.125,1678.149,"My hypo is at the guilt stage, not the sentencing stage."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1678.149,1679.789,"At the guilt stage, that's right."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1694.458,1713.681,"But at the guilt stage, is there any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the family members to display this message to a jury throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a risk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider improper influences in reaching its verdict?"
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1714.28,1719.595,"Your Honor, your... your buttons might raise an impermissible risk."
2006.05-785,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.595,1720.916,That's my hypothetical.
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1728.56,1736.535,"They do, but it might still be reasonable for a state court to conclude otherwise."
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.989,1754.199,"Thank you, Mr. Ott."
2006.05-785,0,25852,gregory_a_ott,,1754.199,1754.6,Thank you.
2006.05-785,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1754.6,1758.464,Mr. Fermino?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1758.464,1765.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2006.05-785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.73,1854.475,I thought the key sentence in this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a button which... I don't know what the size is.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1900.429,1903.131,"Justice Breyer, I think that the--"
2006.05-785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.131,1904.219,In this case.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1904.219,1905.481,--That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.361,1936.721,It goes on frequently in an opinion.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.348,1950.522,"And that language came from one of our opinions, didn't it?"
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.401,1953.143,That was quoting Holbrook and Flynn.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1953.143,1954.943,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.744,1959.377,So you can't fault the court for just saying it isn't that.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1961.608,1962.747,That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.226,1979.1,"Repeated later in opinions for the majority, I think."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1979.1,1979.741,--That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.741,1981.711,"In later cases, so I mean--"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1981.711,1982.141,That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.141,1983.912,--Don't just put it in Brennan's dissent.
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.912,1989.856,I don't understand your point about the state court focusing on Norris.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,1994.63,2001.783,"Well, in this instance, much has been said about the opinion and the carefully written opinion of the state court."
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.41,2025.419,"But in here it... you agree that the California court has as much authority to say what Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right?"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2033.546,2034.415,That is correct.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2034.415,2047.614,"So that this state court of appeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a very strong argument."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2047.614,2049.465,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully disagree."
2006.05-785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.112,2095.924,"Well, what was the... what in your opinion... this is why... as you can see, I'm concerned about buttons."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2165.702,2170.193,"--Well, Justice Breyer, that is certainly a plausible reading of the state court opinion."
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.075,2203.105,To wear any buttons?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2205.346,2221.468,--Any courtroom practice that causes an impermissible risk that the jury's... that the jury would come to a conclusion based on a factor not introduced at trial is entirely prejudicial--
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2221.468,2232.885,"I mean, most... I don't think... a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2249.705,2255.278,--I agree with Mr. Chief Justice up unto the point of it's not different wearing the buttons.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.877,2282.186,"But in Williams and Flynn and all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they went, it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court with shackles."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2299.898,2302.041,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.454,2324.217,That certainly goes beyond where our precedent leaves off.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2335.473,2336.224,--That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.224,2336.564,Yes.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2354.998,2356.037,Justice--
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2356.037,2359.009,"--much, it has much more impact than a button."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2359.009,2361.09,--It... and it might.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.409,2399.017,"Yeah, but there is a First Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution, people other than the state, who is bringing this prosecution."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2399.017,2402.958,There is no question that there is a First Amendment issue here.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.958,2404.04,So that makes it a different case.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2408.072,2413.816,"Well, in the First Amendment context, though, there's a balancing test that needs to be employed, and it--"
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.816,2433.348,"Sure, it may come out the way... it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or--"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2433.348,2437.89,--I believe that Mr. Cohen in New Hampshire wearing his sign regarding the draft--
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.89,2439.152,"--Well, but that cuts against you."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2439.152,2440.403,"--I understand that, but--"
2006.05-785,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.403,2453.69,"This reason... suppose, hypothetically, I would think... well, the rule should be no buttons."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2508.258,2535.383,"--Justice Breyer, I think that the rule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that courtroom... courtroom behavior that creates an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have... or have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial."
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.579,2576.382,So what about... what if the issue was mourning?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2585.228,2590.371,"--I think you're getting... Mr. Chief Justice, I think the hypothetical gets closer to it as well."
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.319,2617.599,"No, my question is under AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2617.599,2618.209,Yes.
2006.05-785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2618.209,2637.742,"Even if it didn't, though, I suppose you could draw a line between people who were doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear mourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and be reminded of the person who died and sob."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2645.026,2645.827,That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2645.827,2649.48,And so you've got... I think you've got a stronger argument.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2746.693,2758.511,I think it is a factor to consider in the Court's analysis.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.168,2777.561,But there have been... haven't there been court decisions that have held that buttons didn't compromise a fair trial right?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2777.561,2778.592,That's correct.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.592,2794.034,"So in assessing the reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly established when other courts considering our precedent have gone the other way?"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2794.034,2815.167,"Because I think that under... I think that this Court looking at the ""contrary to"" prong of the analysis would... can come to a conclusion that the state court's decision wasn't... I'm getting ahead of myself."
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2833.739,2839.292,"You don't want to put your... hang your hat on the ""contrary to"" prong, though, do you?"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2842.587,2843.876,"I think it's both, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.631,2855.383,"Well, but, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case involving spectators."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2868.933,2879.109,"--I wouldn't go... Mr. Chief Justice, I would not go as far as ""an awful stretch"", but I would think that we, under the unreasonable application prong, we certainly win."
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.471,2896.96,"The record is confusing, at least as I read it... please correct me if I'm wrong... on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2900.834,2902.273,It is not.
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2904.775,2906.818,So it may have been for just one day of the trial?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2906.818,2907.967,It may have been.
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2929.292,2930.394,Where does it say that?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2930.394,2932.975,Those declarations appear--
2006.05-785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.975,2936.237,These are in the joint appendix.
2006.05-785,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.237,2940.04,These were declarations filed with the United States district court in habeas?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2940.04,2943.07,--They were filed actually as part of the state collateral review proceedings.
2006.05-785,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2950.315,2953.828,Where does it say in there that the buttons were worn every day?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2953.828,2956.57,"If I did... I'm sorry, that question--"
2006.05-785,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2956.57,2961.983,"It says that the family members were there every day, or for many days."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2965.005,2966.635,"--No, Justice Alito, if I said that, I misspoke."
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.507,2972.86,There was a time when the trial judge said stop.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2978.472,2979.284,Correct.
2006.05-785,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.284,2986.279,But I thought that there was a time in the course of the trial when he told the family members to stop wearing the buttons.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,2986.279,2988.36,"I don't believe so, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-785,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2996.445,3014.747,"--In his opinion on denial of rehearing, Judge Kleinfeld on the Ninth Circuit made the point that at criminal trials... and I suppose at other trials... it is an accepted feature of the proceeding that there are going to be spectators who identify with one or the other party."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3042.126,3047.259,"Justice Alito, I do, as far as it goes, accept that as a baseline."
2006.05-785,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3056.875,3069.572,So what is it about these particular buttons that's reflected in the record that shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be inferred just from that rather common feature of trials?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3069.572,3074.347,"I think in looking at the rule again derived from Williams and Flynn, we don't have to go there."
2006.05-785,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3093.493,3094.312,Why is there a greater risk?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3101.835,3112.974,"Because you can imagine as a juror... jurors are very attentive during trials... that they look out into the audience and see in the jury box... I mean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing buttons."
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.9,3124.341,Let's assume... risk of what?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3175.466,3183.049,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a risk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial testing."
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.081,3187.461,I don't see the possibility.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3188.873,3190.706,Here you have--
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.706,3199.89,"--Is there a real possibility that a jury is going to say, since this man's... this victim's family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?"
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3199.89,3202.822,--But that's only one possible message of this button.
2006.05-785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3211.057,3214.64,Do you have to depend on there being a message?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3258.608,3259.78,I don't disagree with that.
2006.05-785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3259.78,3260.18,Do you accept that?
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3260.18,3263.373,"I do accept that, and I don't need to rely on a message."
2006.05-785,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3267.945,3268.786,Okay.
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3268.786,3284.286,The... I think it is important here to look at the fact that no party in this case... that the state has not advanced that this is a practice that should be endorsed or adopted.
2006.05-785,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.639,3325.172,"Well, that's just because we haven't had a First Amendment case yet."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3343.926,3352.223,"But this Court, I think, could craft an opinion that addresses that concern without the need for simply awaiting that day."
2006.05-785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.223,3358.876,"Counsel, I'm not sure you're right that nobody was concerned about... everybody thought the factors were wrong."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3363.641,3364.699,And I misspoke.
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.605,3375.939,"Thank you, Mr. Fermino."
2006.05-785,1,20831,david_w_fermino,,3375.939,3376.56,--Thank you.
2006.05-785,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.56,3379.439,"Mr. Ott, you have one minute remaining."
2006.05-785,2,25852,gregory_a_ott,,3379.439,3383.403,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-785,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.997,3389.529,"Thank you, Mr. Ott."
