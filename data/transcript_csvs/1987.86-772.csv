1987.86-772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.481,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-772, the City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,13.605,15.135,Thank you.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,311.609,315.357,"Mr. Wilson, may I ask you a question before you get into the more details?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,315.357,315.748,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.748,323.369,Is it your view that the question whether a particular agent of the City is a policy making official is a question of fact or a question of law?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,323.369,325.181,"Clearly, a question of law."
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.181,333.725,"So, then it doesn't... and you point is that regardless of what the evidence was, since he didn't... I mean it was with regard to a particular transaction, he could not qualify?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,333.725,336.926,"Yes, that would be correct."
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.8,344.471,"And the judge shouldn't have even given the jury the instruction,"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,348.032,349.407,That is correct.
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.592,366.603,"Well, Mr. Wilson, the jury was instructed that they could determine in effect whether the named defendants were policy makers; were they not?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,369.43,375.208,They were instructed that high government officials could be held liable.
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.208,376.786,And you did not object to that instruction.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,379.333,380.566,"Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.566,382.955,But now you say that was wrong?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,382.955,383.565,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.01,418.987,Was there evidence in the record from which the jury might have concluded that the mayor or a member of the mayor's cabinet or council had approved the transfer knowing that it was in retaliation for--
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,418.987,422.799,"--Well, the jury would have had to follow the instructions, I think."
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.124,445.618,"--Well, I asked you whether there was evidence in the record from which a jury might have concluded that the mayor or member of his council or cabinet had approved the transfer knowing it was in retaliation?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,445.618,451.49,"--There is nothing in... my interpretation of the record, there is nothing in there that would support that inference."
1987.86-772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,661.158,670.154,"Mr. Wilson, as the case comes to us, I gather that the only argument that there is a policy maker here is that it is Hamsher?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,670.154,672.09,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,679.851,681.601,Does the Respondent argue differently?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,687.412,695.986,"--The Respondent did in their verdict directing instruction, Your Honor, two other supervisors."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.749,706.202,"Well, what does Respondent argue here?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,706.202,710.17,I believe the Respondent--
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.17,713.183,Just defends the Eighth Circuit decision?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,713.605,714.011,--No.
1987.86-772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.374,749.168,The Eighth Circuit exonerated the other two; did it not?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,749.168,749.949,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,749.949,751.402,Or did the jury do it?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,751.402,757.213,"Well, the jury exonerated all the individual defendants."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.064,776.61,"Well, and that that act represented City policy?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,776.61,778.157,"--Yes, that's right."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.408,893.126,Who was the policy maker in your view in this case?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,894.437,896.109,The Civil Service Commission.
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.109,900.388,They set the rules of the game about hiring and firing and transferring?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,900.388,900.747,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.416,916.555,And people like Hamsher are just... are supposed to take acts consistent with that policy?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,916.555,918.647,"--Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.647,932.032,"Mr. Wilson, if your view is correct, why wouldn't it be in the interest of every municipality to confer all policy making authority for everything upon one individual, say, the mayor."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,957.85,961.208,"Well, I guess if I could explain, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.619,990.446,"Well, then it is not a question of law, exclusively, as you told us earlier?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,990.446,993.413,--In respect I think to single incident liability.
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.275,1027.492,I see.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1040.316,1043.565,I think that is an open question.
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.865,1114.24,Where is that?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1114.24,1120.066,"That's in our brief, in our petition at A-22."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.636,1153.302,Suppose that it was perfectly plain that the charter or the city council or whoever actually delegated to Hamsher the policy making authority to set the rules of the game.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1170.826,1172.324,Contrary to his own?
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.324,1181.915,"Well, certainly, he didn't... certainly, he didn't publish a policy of discriminatory discharges."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1181.915,1182.571,"No, that is correct."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.571,1187.053,But he did make a discriminatory discharge and he was the policy maker.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1189.036,1191.833,"Under that hypothetical, we would say, no."
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.844,1208.139,"You are just not accepting my hypothesis, but that's all right."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1208.139,1214.12,"--If I may, Justice White?"
1987.86-772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.12,1214.37,Go ahead.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1214.37,1224.944,"If there was a delegation of authority, if it was a lawful delegation, I think you are going to have difficulty finding lawful delegations of authority."
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1237.001,1248.903,"Well, what if a lower ranking city official assumes the responsibility for making decisions that could be interpreted as policy decisions?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1269.348,1281.03,"I think in respect to single incidents, we would say, no, unless the Civil Service Commission in this instance would have had actual knowledge that the transfer was impermissibly motivated."
1987.86-772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.03,1281.749,Or constructive knowledge?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1281.749,1288.216,"We would say that there would be... clearly, no liability in that particular case."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.003,1318.905,"What if what is open and notorious is not the particular policy that has been adopted by the delegee, the de facto delegee?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1340.053,1351.174,"--If, again, we're in the second category, custom and practice, liability can occur where there is acquiescence by the policy maker."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.174,1352.174,In the delegation.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1355.438,1357.094,In the mere delegation?
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.987,1401.888,"So the mayor can leave it to somebody and so long as that person does not act consistently enough to establish a policy that becomes open and notorious, there can be no municipal liability."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1405.152,1407.761,"That is our position, yes."
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.909,1503.971,"Mr. Wilson, can I ask you a question?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1512.312,1513.124,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.124,1523.527,Could it get away from the single incident posture if several times this sort of thing happened to the same individual or would that still be a single incident as long as it is one individual?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1523.527,1524.902,Yes.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.415,1533.711,"If there was several retaliatory adverse actions against this individual, you would say that could amount to policy?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1533.711,1536.537,--That would be still an ad hoc decision.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.549,1556.778,Are you saying that still is a single incident if the same thing happened to Employee X six or seven times that he was constantly treated in this same way.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1560.746,1565.79,I think it might... it would be my position that that would still be a single incident.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.79,1574.132,"What is the difference between six adverse actions for Mr. Smith and one adverse action for Mr. A, B, C, D, and E?"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1574.132,1576.099,That would be my position.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.47,1590.312,"No, but I am assuming three police chases of the same individual."
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1595.935,1599.824,I don't think you can establish a custom in a relationship with a single employee.
1987.86-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.682,1605.446,No matter how often you repeated it?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1605.446,1609.132,If confined to that single employee--
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.132,1611.1,"What if the mayor called people in and he said,"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1614.552,1633.607,"--If the mayor did that, under our interpretation, the mayor would be a policy maker for certain instances, along with the Civil Service Commission, that would be... impose municipal liability under a single incident, because the act, the impermissible conduct comes from the policy maker."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.607,1635.263,"But if a lower official says,"
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1642.664,1648.616,"Yes, until it would take on the custom and practice which would have to be developed by the totality of facts."
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.616,1651.709,Is that the practice against Praprotnik or not?
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1651.709,1655.91,We would say not.
1987.86-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.91,1657.16,I thought so.
1987.86-772,0,33585,james_j_wilson,,1657.16,1658.722,That would be our position.
1987.86-772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.971,1664.235,"Yes, Mr. Wilson."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1666.797,1675.153,"If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice:"
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.171,1870.73,"Well, by that, do you mean they had to approve what amounted to some kind of reorganization or restructuring of city agencies?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1870.73,1871.214,--That's right.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.214,1875.134,In terms of what a specific agency would do.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1875.134,1881.366,They had to approve the change of the budget and the change of the functions so that they could be assigned over here.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.366,1888.785,"Is that the evidence on which the jury was able to determine, if it did, that the mayor was linked to this?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1888.785,1889.988,That's part of the evidence.
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.666,1916.914,"Was there a change in the office of mayor, Mr. Oldham, sometime during these proceedings--"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1916.914,1920.772,There was a Mr. Conway who was... preceded a Mr. Famel.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.932,2001.427,"--Mr. Oldham, may I inquire of your position whether... if there is a policy making person or body of the city in charge of making policy for employment practices, hiring, transfers and discharge, and; if a lower ranking employee supervisor has the authority to actually hire, fire and transfer people, and, if that lower ranking employee decides for wholly improper reasons to make a retaliatory transfer and constructive discharge of an employee without the knowledge or consent of the policy making body, can the city be held liable?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2001.427,2003.613,Under 1983?
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2003.613,2004.128,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2004.128,2016.686,Only on what we would consider appropriate circumstances where the higher officials or the policy making body was aware of what happened or had constructive notice of what happened and permitted it to go on.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2016.686,2029.633,"So, you take the position that there would be no liability under the example I gave unless there was actual or constructive knowledge and/or approval by the policy making body."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2030.29,2031.821,That is correct.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.96,2041.285,And do you take the position that here the mayor was the policy maker or the Civil Service Commission?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2041.285,2041.535,All right.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2055.358,2059.652,"Well, was the Civil Service Commission the policy making body?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2059.652,2065.495,"For certain services it is a policy making body and for certain other purposes, it is not."
1987.86-772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.495,2073.523,The right to make transfers is what you say they delegated is not necessarily the right to establish policy for transfers.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2075.132,2075.773,All right.
1987.86-772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.518,2085.518,I am not saying in this case.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2093.17,2098.918,Every city has a different situation.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.694,2117.568,Do you think the jury can determine all that?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2122.455,2125.142,"I think it is a mixed question of law, in fact, like many things."
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.354,2186.086,Did the same mayor make all of these decisions that you are talking about?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2186.086,2198.597,"Yes, the same mayor was involved... in the first instance, the first suspension was done by Mr. Spaid who was then Director of CDA under a different mayor."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.345,2210.794,"And are you relying on the constructive discharge theory of the Eighth Circuit, here?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2210.794,2212.715,"Well, that is what happened."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2212.715,2216.339,"Well, do you agree with the Eighth Circuit?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2217.511,2223.806,I don't agree with some of the parts of the decision of the Eighth Circuit.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.209,2233.707,You don't agree with the final authority test.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2238.581,2238.909,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2256.838,2260.697,--Was the jury instructed on that theory?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2260.697,2261.275,No.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.462,2354.112,"And you think that a single action of a constructive discharge, even if known by the mayor can subject to 1983 liability?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2354.112,2355.252,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.659,2403.388,"Well, suppose the City with knowledge of its mayor just makes a discharge of a Civil Service employee without good cause."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2412.4,2418.366,I think that you... if you have a policy maker who makes a decision to violate somebody's constitutional rights--
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2418.366,2419.631,A single decision?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2419.631,2420.709,--Single decision.
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.188,2445.669,"How is that any different than just ordinary respondents responding at superior, which Monell said that they were not going to settle for in the case of municipal liability."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2445.669,2454.54,"As I understand Monell, it also said that when a high public official or policy maker speaks on behalf of the city that that can create liability."
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.54,2460.319,"It can create a policy, but I thought you answer to Justice O'Connor's question intimated that all you need is the one instance."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2462.099,2471.22,"Well, I think that one instance is... and, actually, one instance can in appropriate circumstances create the policy which raises the issue of liability."
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.704,2478.015,"Well, then that really is just indistinguishable from Respondent's superior?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2484.294,2489.416,"Justice Rehnquist, I differentiate that because I talk about a policy maker having that right."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.129,2512.125,Even though it is hard to say that the firing of somebody for the exercise of constitutional rights is a policy; isn't it?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2512.125,2517.045,"Well, I think the courts have held that there is liability under 1983."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2587.877,2601.996,"Mr. Oldham, could the employee who alleges a constructive discharge by virtue of a transfer file an appeal with the Civil Service Commission and get it heard?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2601.996,2604.057,"No, not in this case."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2605.713,2606.149,"Well, now, wait a minute."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2617.473,2623.314,--This is the one the Commission refused to hear until the matter had been resolved by the courts.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2625.408,2626.719,Because it was already in court?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2626.719,2629.202,"--Oh, we were already in court on the transfer."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2629.202,2630.78,"And so the Commission said,"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2633.373,2635.388,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2635.388,2638.621,Because the employee chose to take it to court?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2638.621,2641.933,"Well, we were already in court on the transfer situation."
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.933,2645.306,A suit had been filed by your client?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2647.726,2650.35,We had filed a complaint in Federal Court.
1987.86-772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2650.35,2650.819,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2650.819,2655.988,Under Section 1983 alleging the transfer was a violation of his constitutional rights.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.619,2690.084,"Well, I take it that we should consider this case only against the background of the transcript?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2690.084,2695.738,"Well, I was responding to a question by Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.738,2698.238,"Yes, I know, but not in light of any kind of a discharge?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2698.238,2705.407,"There was a constructive discharge in this case by... that resulted from the transfer, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.499,2711.514,How do we know it was a constructive discharge?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2711.514,2719.745,"Well, the Court of Appeals, you know, in reviewing the evidence felt that this was constructive discharge."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.745,2723.993,But that wasn't how the jury had been instructed.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2726.68,2729.131,The jury was instructed on the transfer and the lay-off.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.175,2747.702,"I take it that you don't... let's assume that it is perfectly clear the Commission makes transfer policy and suppose the transfer policy says,"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2756.199,2758.308,Hamsher.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.308,2759.166,"Hamsher, all right."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2769.413,2770.304,"Not in every instance, Your Honor."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.304,2779.503,"Well, if he acts quite contrary to an expressed policy, how can the City be liable in that case?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2779.503,2785.641,"Well, I think that if you look at the history of 1983 you had a situation in the south where--"
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.641,2788.625,Just take my example.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2788.625,2788.998,--Okay.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.998,2791.108,Do you think that the City is liable in that?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2791.108,2794.652,There are situations where the City would be liable.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.492,2811.647,"Well, let's just say it was made solely by that subordinate officer supposedly carrying out a policy, but he disobeys it."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2811.647,2818.314,"In a situation like that, Your Honor, I don't think there would be liability on the part of the City under 1983."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.36,2828.888,"Well, I take it, then, that you don't really defend the Court of Appeals rationale of this final authority business?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2828.888,2833.091,"Your Honor, I think there has to be a little bit more than the final authority process."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.01,2838.26,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2838.26,2840.619,And that is the theory upon which this case was tried.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.893,2878.931,"Well, suppose if we think... if we think that the Court of Appeals proceeded on the wrong legal basis in doing what it did, shouldn't it have a chance to redo its appellate job based on the right rule of law?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2878.931,2882.289,"--Well, Your Honor, of course that is one of the options available to the Court."
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.751,2899.141,Right.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2899.141,2901.124,I think that is entirely possible.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.124,2912.293,Let me just ask you if you agree that this is a single incident case?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2912.293,2912.994,I do not.
1987.86-772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.994,2914.385,Why not?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2914.385,2918.993,"Well, because actions against Praprotnik covered a period of almost three years."
1987.86-772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.437,2991.213,But you don't give any other instances where any of these things was done to anyone else.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3001.491,3004.334,"That is about what happened, Judge, because I remember there was a--"
1987.86-772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.334,3009.645,Do you think that meets the... do you think that's what a policy means in our decisions?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3027.605,3029.057,--I think that is within the meaning of 1983.
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.25,3100.623,But the policy is to get this one man.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3100.623,3101.561,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3101.561,3103.544,"Well, that is single; isn't it?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3107.48,3110.682,But there were a number of incidents involving that single--
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.682,3112.462,But that is all it was: one man.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3112.462,3113.243,--One man.
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.243,3118.71,"Secondly, how much of this was given to the mayor, presented to the mayor?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3118.71,3120.301,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3120.301,3123.707,How much of this was told to the mayor?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3123.707,3129.127,That is difficult to say because--
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3129.127,3132.297,"Well, so far as the record shows--"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3132.297,3134.047,"--in terms of direct words to Mr. Praprotnik, nobody said,"
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3137.249,3139.857,"--Well, how do you get the mayor involved in this?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3139.857,3148.48,"Because the mayor made the decision to transfer Mr. Praprotnik and made decisions to transfer the function, which, incidentally, were never transferred."
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.425,3169.345,Did the mayor ever see the Respondent?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3169.345,3170.048,--Pardon?
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3170.048,3173.765,Did the mayor ever lay his eyes on the Respondent?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3173.765,3175.577,"I think so, yes."
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.577,3176.748,When?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3178.326,3180.653,The record reflects that--
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3180.653,3183.886,The records reflect that he didn't even know anything about this man; doesn't it?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3183.886,3184.293,"--Oh, no."
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3186.995,3188.915,"Well, that's what I asked you."
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3197.88,3202.504,The record reflects that the mayor made the decision to transfer him.
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.638,3262.62,Somebody told somebody that the mayor was unhappy.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3262.62,3264.167,Yes.
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3264.167,3265.993,And that charges the mayor with firing him?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3265.993,3269.789,Mr. Hamsher--
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3269.789,3276.38,Somebody told somebody that the mayor was unhappy.
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3278.957,3281.769,--An agent of the mayor told Mr. Praprotnik... his supervisor told Mr. Praprotnik--
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.769,3284.533,Is there anything in the record to show that the mayor was unhappy?
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3284.533,3287.688,--Other than statements of his agents?
1987.86-772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.688,3296.122,"Is there anything other than hearsay in the record to show that the mayor was, quote, unhappy, end quote?"
1987.86-772,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,3296.122,3304.915,"Your Honor, I don't think that a statement of an employee or agent of the mayor is hearsay."
1987.86-772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3339.433,3342.025,"Thank you, Mr. Oldham."
1987.86-772,2,33585,james_j_wilson,,3344.306,3351.834,We have now in Respondent's argument interjected the mayor of the City of St. Louis into this dispute.
1987.86-772,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.616,3431.832,"But, Mr. Wilson, as I understand it, you are relying on your motion for a directed verdict at the close of his case."
1987.86-772,2,33585,james_j_wilson,,3431.832,3432.441,"Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-772,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.441,3438.939,"Which, it seems to me, allows your opponent to rely on evidence in the record, even though it might not have been referred to in the instructions?"
1987.86-772,2,33585,james_j_wilson,,3438.939,3440.625,"Yes, that is correct."
1987.86-772,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.982,3452.59,"No, but at the directed verdict stage, you are not really debating the theory of the case of whether there is any evidence that would sustain liability under 1983."
1987.86-772,2,33585,james_j_wilson,,3452.59,3472.472,"I think, Justice Stevens, I think we get to the point of attempting to identify the policy maker and I think for that purpose we wanted to make sure that it was clear that the mayor, who may be, along with the Civil Service Commission, to be a policy maker, was not in any way involved in this particular retaliatory transfer."
1987.86-772,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.256,3507.053,"Your time is expired, Mr. Wilson."
