1988.87-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument next in number 87-998, the city of Richmond v. the J. A. Croson Company."
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,87.356,100.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the sole issue in this case is the constitutionality of the ordinance enacted by the Appellant, the city of Richmond, to remedy the effects of racial discrimination in its construction industry."
1988.87-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,168.391,169.51,"Mr. Payton, can I interrupt you there?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,176.414,192.106,"--There is no evidence in the record with regard to how subcontracting was divided up, but as the District Court found, there is no reason at all to expect that the subcontracting would have gone another way."
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.205,295.574,"But the ordinance purport to remedy that disparity, did it?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,295.574,303.061,The ordinance purported to remedy the fact that there were very few minority contractors in the construction industry.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.061,304.644,It just required subs to get to a--
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,304.644,306.763,Yes.
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.349,379.192,"--Mr. Payton, some of the cities concerned seem to be with impediments to minority participation, such as complicated bidding procedures and lack of capital and bonding requirements and so forth."
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,390.916,399.855,"Well, the city was well aware of other efforts, especially efforts by the United States Congress, to deal with this problem."
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.053,432.576,"But we don't know what the figures were on subcontractors, as your response to Justice Stevens pointed out."
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,432.576,433.526,"Yes, that's correct."
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.134,453.406,"Did the... now, the ordinance supplied also, in addition to Blacks, to Orientals, Indians and Aleut persons?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,453.406,454.023,Yes.
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.023,462.695,"And was there evidence before the city that they had been subject to discrimination in the Richmond construction industry, do you know?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,462.695,465.463,There is no evidence in the record with regard to that.
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.463,470.015,And you think with the absence of all such evidence that the ordinance is valid as to those groups?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,470.015,488.996,"The reason the description of minorities that exists in this ordinance is there is that it is the same description of minorities the exists in the Federal program in Fullilove, and in fact, it's the same description of minorities that exists in the Virginia code that defines what a minority business enterprise is."
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,587.826,594.646,"Although Richmond had not tried any of those other race-neutral alternatives, I take it?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,594.646,597.765,"Well, that's not exactly right."
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.765,602.669,"You're saying Congress had not, or... but I guess Richmond--"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,602.669,603.502,That's part of the Congressional remedy.
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,624.249,637.342,"--Do you think that State and local government have as much authority and power to act in this area as Congress does, with its express grant of authority under the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,637.342,644.679,I think that State and local governments have greater responsibility... I'll come to power in just a second.
1988.87-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.808,695.76,Do you mean the commerce power wouldn't have handled it?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,706.799,728.112,"--Well, you may be right, Justice Scalia, but in then Chief Justice Burger's opinion, he made explicit reference to Section Five when he wanted to find a basis for power for the Congress imposing the requirements of the Public Works Employment Act on the States and, through the States, on their subdivisions."
1988.87-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,755.132,765.237,"Although in a sense, the Fourteenth Amendment was precisely designed to prohibit States from taking action on the basis of race, wasn't it?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,765.237,773.926,--I think the Fourteenth Amendment was designed in a way to require States to treat people fairly.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.731,811.718,"Well, it didn't copy... it didn't follow the Fullilove scheme entirely, did it?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,824.859,829.513,There are... there is something to that effect in the Fullilove.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.513,831.097,It's an expressed provision of the regulation.
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,831.097,831.632,Yes.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.953,843.087,"Well, that means that we... you're talking about Fullilove."
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,858.116,859.082,There's nothing like that.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.082,860.382,--There's nothing like that in Richmond.
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,866.353,867.222,"Yes, that is right."
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.607,926.51,Was it... this isn't exactly like Fullilove?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,926.51,927.61,--It is not exactly like Fullilove.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.61,928.46,So you have to mix.
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,933.08,933.714,"No, it was not."
1988.87-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.714,935.199,So it's expired?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,935.199,937.116,It was not reenacted.
1988.87-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.116,942.103,"Well, then, its prescribed duration was five years from June?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,942.103,942.186,That's correct.
1988.87-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.186,943.969,"So it expired on June 30, 1988?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,943.969,945.055,Yes.
1988.87-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.055,946.255,Does that raise a mootness problem?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,946.255,970.086,"The 30 percent figure... let me describe the reach of the remedy, here, and I will get to your question right away, Justice Blackmun."
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1033.327,1048.586,"In this case, the old from the minority subcontractor was some $7,000 over the quotes that the prime had received from other suppliers."
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1058.81,1060.077,"Well, let me--"
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.077,1068.0,"To permit an increased price, and require that the increased price be paid, without a waiver?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1068.0,1071.885,"--There are two points to this, as well."
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.515,1179.387,"Well, is it a requirement then for the validity of an ordinance with such an escalation mechanism that the city absorb the excess?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1179.387,1180.256,It would have.
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.256,1183.625,Is that a requirement for the validity of the ordinance?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1183.625,1184.458,No.
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1184.458,1193.564,So that the costs of during past discrimination can rest on a third party?
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1193.564,1203.003,"Well, construction is competitively bid, and if the city attaches requirements to the bids, people can choose not to bid."
1988.87-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1233.939,1245.747,"But if the competitive forces were not operating, and minority subcontracting was at a premium borne by the prime contractor, that would still not impair the validity of the ordinance?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1245.747,1247.949,"--I think not, but that is not the case we have here."
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.574,1290.376,"There was a minority contractor, a sub, who bid here?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1290.376,1290.977,Yes.
1988.87-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.977,1296.981,"And the only reason he didn't get it, you suggest, is that the prime really discriminated against him?"
1988.87-998,0,32309,john_payton,,1296.981,1299.583,"No, I'm not suggesting that."
1988.87-998,1,46064,walter_h_ryland,,1615.615,1647.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, responding to the last question which was asked of Mr. Payton, on the question of whether the city would absorb the higher bid by the minority supplier in this case, the record is quite explicit that J. A. Croson Company asked the city to do just that, and was refused by the city, on grounds that the bid could not be increased."
1988.87-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.586,1652.288,And so what happened?
1988.87-998,1,46064,walter_h_ryland,,1655.59,1662.66,"The city then announced that because of Croson's noncompliance with the ordinance, the contract would be re-bid."
1988.87-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.66,1668.814,"So the real... so the question is, was this ordinance constitutionally applied in this case?"
1988.87-998,1,46064,walter_h_ryland,,1668.814,1679.02,I think the threshold question which we attack is whether the council had a proper basis for adopting the ordinance in the first place.
1988.87-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.185,1683.887,So you say it's a facial challenge?
1988.87-998,1,46064,walter_h_ryland,,1683.887,1690.625,--It's facial in the sense that we attack the authority to adopt the ordinance.
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,2735.866,2737.349,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-998,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.239,2915.309,"But at some point, don't you reach a situation... supposing a State had 60 percent Black people in it."
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,2922.879,2925.748,"--Well, I can remove the word ""minority"" if it helps the analysis."
1988.87-998,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.399,2953.518,But you surely wouldn't call them minority contracts?
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,2953.518,2954.884,I will remove the word.
1988.87-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.953,2991.707,The discrimination was practiced by... who discriminated against the minority contractors?
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,2991.707,2994.928,"--I think it was a closed business system, as described by--"
1988.87-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.928,2997.962,"Well, that doesn't help me very much."
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,3001.331,3002.681,"--No, it's not the city."
1988.87-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.376,3022.828,"well, I suppose you could say that about any industry."
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,3022.828,3027.047,"No, you can't."
1988.87-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.047,3029.149,In the past?
1988.87-998,2,32309,john_payton,,3030.351,3031.418,"No, you can't."
1988.87-998,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.527,3047.393,"Thank you, Mr. Payton."
