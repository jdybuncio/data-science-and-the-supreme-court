1973.73-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.757,"We will hear arguments next in number 73-786, Ross against Moffitt."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,29.16,32.866,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.93,164.5,There is no intermediate appellate Court in Virginia?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,164.5,170.089,Not at all Your Honor and nor is there are any appeals as a right in Virginia.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.63,179.836,We are talking about the criminal cases only here?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,179.836,180.377,"Oh, yes Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.84,182.425,Only?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,182.425,191.071,And I am advised that in the state of Virginia the writ of error if it’s denied is summarily denied.
1973.73-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.505,199.391,Is that a full Court reconsideration here?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,199.391,215.216,"I really can’t speak for State of Virginia Your Honor, I’m told that it is possible and this is going to the Fourth Circuit that oral argument can be had by the attorney for the petitioner in support of his petition but --"
1973.73-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.216,218.86,I just wonder this is like a majority vote of the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,218.86,223.68,I have to plead on that fact Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.68,224.765,How about in North Carolina?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,224.765,228.267,"Okay, in North Carolina we have a multi-tiered system."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.164,252.955,Directly?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,252.955,260.25,Direct appeal as a right if the sentence is death or life imprisonment due bypass the Court of Appeals and go to the Supreme Court.
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.776,287.234,You mean an opinion?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,288.968,291.371,"Well, what I meant Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.25,319.934,"I just ask, to go from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court on an application what do you call this?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,319.934,321.144,Petition for writ of certiorari.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.144,323.33,Petition for writ certiorari?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,328.576,332.164,"Yes, Your Honor that is one of the two instances."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.441,339.143,Of right?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,339.143,349.023,"Of right, and two if there is a substantial question presented under either the constitution of the United States or at least state of North Carolina."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.22,365.275,How many votes does it take to grant in the Court of Appeals?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,367.829,372.11,"I must admit Your Honor, I never even thought about that question, the North Carolina because, we once heard --"
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.11,390.873,"The Courts describing is a situation other -- what we are talking about is exactly the appellate system except that, it takes three votes over the seven of the justices in the Supreme Court to grant a view of what we call a petition for certification rather than the writ of certiorari."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,390.873,401.758,"I must admit that -- we never -- I never thought about that in North Carolina, all my discussions with the members of the courts never really raised that question."
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.331,422.012,Was Moffitt’s case one which could have been appealed as of right?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,422.012,425.474,"No Your Honor, I don’t believe so at all."
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,440.654,450.948,Mr. Safron before you go on who makes the decision as to whether or not there is a substantial question of federal or state constitutional law?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,450.948,458.49,That of course Your Honor makes the distinction whether or not it is on appeal as of right which would require a full briefing or a certiorari which can be summarily --
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,458.49,462.025,I'm thinking about certiorari.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,462.025,463.73,We have no guidelines Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,463.73,474.805,"Well, somebody must make that decision does an immediate appellate Court make it or does a Supreme Court of North Carolina make it?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,474.805,487.633,"If the Court upon the review of petition determines that it is a matter of right, then of course counsel is appointed for full briefing and oral argument."
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,491.187,495.464,Do you think there is no certification by the intermediate appellate court?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,495.464,496.921,There is none Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.474,523.366,"I suppose a person could appeal asserting that a important or substantial or whatever your words are, question of federal or state constitutional law were involved and then it might be up to the Supreme Court of North Carolina to decide whether or not it works."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,523.366,527.746,Your Honor this is the typical catechism of these cases.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,527.746,528.172,Right.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,528.172,553.349,"In fact in the case from Guilford County in which was Mr. Moffitt was represented by the public defender at trial on appeal to the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, you will find that that is the note appended to the Supreme Court's denial of cert that there is no substantial constitutional question involved in petition and the purported appeal is denied."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.349,555.141,"And that’s where the decision is made as I suppose, isn’t it?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,555.141,556.243,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.243,561.136,The assertion is made by the appellant and the decision is made by the --
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,561.136,561.318,By the Court.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.318,562.427,Supreme Court.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,572.877,574.502,A petition for writ of certiorari.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.502,580.292,"Yes, a petition for writ of certiorari was granted because there is an evidentiary question involved here or something like that."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,580.292,580.657,"Well, --"
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.657,581.438,That happened?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,581.438,597.12,The criteria for certiorari is also scheduled in our brief and the situation there is whether or not it appears to be in conflict with an opinion of the Supreme Court or whether or not it’s an issue of statewide importance.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.12,597.912,Right.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,597.912,603.841,The big same criteria which this Court uses in making its determinations of whether or not to grant certiorari.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.841,614.978,I suppose if there is a lawyer he will nominate his papers both in appeal and alternatively a petition for writ of certiorari?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,614.978,617.494,Or he will file both and --
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.494,618.446,And separately.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,618.446,619.671,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.644,641.753,"Who decides it and the court had still certain where you may have answered the Supreme Court that one judge, two judges, the whole Court or?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,641.753,663.462,"Your Honor, whether or not to grant certiorari is determining conference and the number of justices of the seven who would have to vote on it is a number unaware and I don’t believe it’s ever been released outside of the doors of the conference room."
1973.73-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.614,675.611,"And so, we don’t know who -- we don’t know who determined this question as to where there's a substantial problem there."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,675.611,687.985,"Well, that is determined by the Court in conference Your Honor but I just cannot respond to the number of the seven justices who are required to vote to bring up certiorari."
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,687.985,706.795,"Mr. Safron in these cases, where there is a assertion of a substantial constitution question on appeal from the word, whatever it is from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court in a criminal case."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,711.917,712.318,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,712.318,714.2,Does the counsel provide it?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,714.2,718.678,If the Court determines that it is a substantial --
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,718.678,723.844,"Well how about preparation, preparation of the whether we have appeal?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,723.844,728.321,Up till now there has been confusion in the matter Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,792.639,798.489,And this would be even in cases where the North Carolina Supreme Court refused certiorari?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,798.489,800.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.249,840.668,Does North Carolina did criminal defendant get his right to petition for certiorari this Court from North Carolina statute or from Act of Congress.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,840.668,843.253,"Well, from that to Congress Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.253,845.558,Though it’s no right the state confers them?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,845.558,857.401,"Oh, none at all but the Fourth Circuit found that this is a constitutional right and I think taking a simplistic approach to the Fourteenth Amendment."
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,857.401,859.291,You said there was an Act of Congress?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,859.291,863.057,"Well, the jurisdictional statutes Your Honor which established reviewed --"
1973.73-786,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,863.057,867.014,"Oh, I’m sorry I thought my brother Rehnquist was asking about appointment of counsel."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,867.014,868.338,"No, I believe --"
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.338,869.681,"No, no, the certiorari jurisdiction."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,869.681,874.149,"Certiorari jurisdiction of this Court, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.835,888.718,"And now that you’re interrupted, may I ask other question about North Carolina practice, is there an argument ever on the papers on the appeal or petition for writ of certiorari and the Supreme Court of North Carolina?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,888.718,889.488,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.111,895.774,Only if there is a grant?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,895.774,896.665,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.665,897.503,Similar to this Court.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,897.503,898.132,Exactly Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.132,907.704,The system you described is almost identical with that it might state of Ohio except in Ohio there is a 15 minute argument on the most -- what we call a motion to certify.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,908.173,914.457,We have no oral argument in the Supreme Court on a petition for writ of certiorari.
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.457,923.245,"And it’s the denial of a writ deemed they say a matter of substance or it is just ignored, is it a creating precedent?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,923.245,928.653,"Well, the only precedent Your Honor would be an exhaustion of state remedies so it is going to federal Habeas Corpus."
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,928.653,938.297,"Yes, but does anyone ever argue that the denial of certiorari is a legally significant matter in some subsequent case?"
1973.73-786,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.297,940.5,"That is a equivalent in affirmance, in other words."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,940.5,942.163,I have never heard that Your Honor.
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.364,1087.278,Of course the denial certiorari maybe of no precedental significance in this Court but certainly it is of significance to the litigant that petition and in law.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1087.278,1098.14,To the litigant yes Your Honor but to the criminal defendant I don’t believe it’s of any significance because the denial of cert is of no significance.
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1131.62,1140.135,You don’t really think collateral proceeding issue has been raised in a direct appeal?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1140.135,1140.778,"Your Honor, we --"
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.778,1141.727,That is actually decided?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1141.727,1153.263,We have a case State versus White which says we do not but as a practical matter most superior court judges will review the questions.
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1153.263,1155.116,Even after your Supreme Court is decided?
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1155.116,1159.766,"Yes Your Honor, But then again we have the complete federal --"
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.766,1169.303,The Federal Court will insist on utilizing your collateral remedy if the issue has been raised and decided in this --
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1169.303,1175.877,"No, there would be no -- the Federal Court judges would not require that for exhaustion, if the issue has been raised and decided."
1973.73-786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.025,1265.688,"You’re addressing yourself now just to the writ in this Court I take it, it is not --"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1265.688,1269.636,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1316.035,1319.613,"You mean the state courts mainly United States, do you not?"
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1319.613,1321.619,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1321.619,1329.426,"I don’t follow that whether or not we would grant cert, does it depend on whether or not the petition is represented by intent."
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1329.426,1345.001,But the Fourth Circuit has said Your Honor that he has a constitutional right to the appointment of counsel to seek certiorari from this Court and so if you have a constitutional right just like the other constitutional rights where you have a right to counsel.
1973.73-786,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1348.383,1353.266,But you are not arguing that we have to hear the cases because he has the constitutional the right to be done.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1353.266,1353.786,"No, part of it but I have --"
1973.73-786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1353.786,1359.89,I think that you are arguing that instead of 4000 more or less we might have a great many more.
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1359.89,1372.066,I’m arguing Your Honor that the factor by which cases -- filings are multiplying this Court would probably be in the nature of three to four within the next two terms.
1973.73-786,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1372.066,1379.218,Would it be in better shape if we had because I think --
1973.73-786,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1379.218,1383.492,"Of course Your Honor, this case had never come true that procedure."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,1733.617,1738.722,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.545,1919.695,What do you mean by the adversary process Mr. Anderson?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,1919.695,1931.845,The Kirby decision Mr. Justice Rehnquist delineates that the right to counsel accrues when the adversary -- formal adversary proceedings are instituted or indictment warrant.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.845,1939.029,Are you suggesting that for instance federal habeas is not part of the adversary process?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,1939.029,1946.222,Whether its adversary nature it’s not -- it doesn’t emanate from the actual accusation of the trial.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.469,1999.551,"But, may I ask you -- see this will -- clarified for me."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2036.263,2038.212,On habeas corpus?
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.212,2041.099,"Coming up through the Court of Appeals, Federal Court of Appeals."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2041.099,2068.683,"I know of no provision other than the Criminal Justice Act and that Act provides that once counsel is appointed by the Fourth Circuit for argument in the Fourth Circuit, that the attorney shall not abandon his client that if he wins that he shall and petition for certiorari is made by the opposite side, and he shall answer the petition and shall continue in the case until this Court either release him or further appoints him."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.683,2085.824,"Now on my hypothetical illustration, the man has had the five tiers into judicial process state and federal and the position is that he must be provided with three counsel to prepare a petition here."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2085.824,2086.505,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.505,2087.802,I thought it is understood.
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2087.802,2111.393,"No, that is what I would term a collateral proceeding as opposed to direct review where the defendant had his conviction affirmed by appellate court and seeks discretionary review by the highest state Court or discretionary review by this Court after failing to gain either review or reversal in the highest state court."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2111.393,2120.744,You are carving out these last two stages because it’s not direct review and it’s hardly I gather because you view it as a civil?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2120.744,2132.282,"Well, traditionally I haven’t viewed civil in nature and they are not direct review although the Court’s have used the discretion to appoint counsel in particular cases where they’re needed."
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.21,2157.963,"To the extent that Douglas is based on the equal protection clause the idea that if the state grants the right of appeal, it has to make it equally available to everybody regardless of money."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2175.082,2192.15,That’s true Your Honor but the state does convict the defendant and it's that state trial that's being reviewed and for the defendant of means who can't afford to take review whether by act of congress or by act of the North Carolina legislature.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.31,2200.645,But Douglas made it perfectly clear that the state didn’t have to give any right of appeal at all?
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.488,2211.19,Why should the state have to commence an appeal here?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2211.19,2220.937,"For the state as I read the statute Your Honor, statute requires the state to do so, I have set that statute on page three of my brief --"
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.937,2222.646,"Oh, I know but exactly about the Constitution."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2222.646,2225.64,"The Constitution, I see no --"
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.64,2228.286,And that’s what the Fourth Circuit decision?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2228.286,2238.14,"Well, the Fourth Circuit’s decision remanded it for a determination and whether or not there was a substantial constitutional claim and if there was then the state had to afford counsel to --"
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2238.14,2244.505,If there is a substantial constitutional claim as a constitutional right that counsel is preparing a petition for writ of certiorari?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2244.505,2245.251,Yes.
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.251,2249.5,Which the state is going to pay for under the Fourth Circuit.
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2249.5,2251.09,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2254.72,2264.773,I know but it is nevertheless the Federal Constitution in the Federal Court system that is involved.
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2264.773,2284.254,"The State of North Carolina of course, would be the Court will be the executive agency which will imprison the defendant and it is the state which initially sought the conviction and Congress of course puts a remedy by way of certiorari on this Court."
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.254,2295.639,What is the percentage of criminal cases or something they reviewed here from affirmances by the North Carolina Supreme Court?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2295.639,2304.766,"I do not, I have no statistics as to how many are or whether or not they are represented by counsel or not."
1973.73-786,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.869,2320.172,"Well, do you know how many petition, what percentage of cases in the Court of Appeals, criminal cases in Court of Appeals are sought to be reviewed here?"
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2320.172,2321.679,I don’t know the answer to that one.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.693,2370.357,Are you familiar with the figures in the Federal Courts on the increase in appeals and criminal cases from District Court judgments to the Court of Appeal after it became free under the criminal justice act accompanied by the bill reforming?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2370.357,2373.955,You are asking me Mr. Chief Justice am I familiar with the figures?
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2373.955,2375.584,What the trend was?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2375.584,2382.543,I think the trend and I am only reaching back and my memory was that there was no substantial change.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.541,2444.978,That if it is established by the State I certainly see that that you can make a point on the Supreme Court of North Carolina but do you think the equal protection argument really has any weight at all in the discretionary review here?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2444.978,2452.512,I would Your Honor based upon the fact that the remedy exists to review a State Court conviction.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.512,2455.355,But North Carolina doesn’t give it?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2455.355,2458.661,It doesn’t give the remedy that is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.73-786,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.661,2471.386,"If the test is conviction that you are attacking a conviction, it seems to me that your argument is equally applicable the habeas where you are certainly attacking a state conviction."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2471.386,2478.594,It’s a process that you’re attacking the conviction that I would assume -- I would say would be the difference.
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.308,2558.978,"Why will he would be taking some risk if he didn't, wouldn't he?"
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2558.978,2560.142,If he did not or he did?
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.142,2567.564,If he did not of an attack later and post conviction is something of an effect of the system to counsel?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2567.564,2574.5,"Well, that would presuming that the defendant and the counsel had a dialog which in most cases they do."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.663,2597.85,"You’re more persuasive than some counsel because the pattern in many districts has been that when one counsel refused to take an appeal, there is a demand for another counsel and that continued until they got someone who would take it."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2597.85,2616.348,I would say that would be the exception rather than rules Mr. Chief Justice that most cases you would find that the defendant would see that his counsel is not as adversary but is representative and therefore seeking that the root or the remedy that is best for him.
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.041,2678.669,"Well, what do you think of financial burden on the state compensate challenges of Fourth Circuits?"
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2678.669,2680.613,I think the financial burden would be very small.
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.753,2701.989,And does that include petitioning in your Supreme Court?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2701.989,2712.061,"I would put it this way the -- I read the statute, the enabling statute to say that we are required to do so."
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.061,2713.347,You mean your North Carolina statute?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2713.347,2733.613,"I do Your Honor and in the appendix to the Fourth Circuit brief, there is a letter from the Administrative Office of the Courts which states that the administrative office pays for at least in those cases where the petitioner or the defendant went to the higher state court."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.647,2759.57,But the state has done this as a matter of policy up to this point have they not?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2759.57,2762.316,I think there has been no policy Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2762.316,2767.175,It sounds like a pretty good policy the way you describe it.
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2767.175,2768.891,Maybe I miss-interpreted your question.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2768.891,2787.532,"Well, the decision about the state of North Carolina to provide this assistance has been one of decision of public policy by the legislature perhaps influenced by the views of judges or perhaps not but the question for us now is not a policy question but whether the constitution requires it, does it not?"
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2787.532,2788.847,That’s correct.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.112,2817.613,Let me ask you a hypothetical question and it may seem extreme but I want to test it.
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2845.918,2858.264,I would say that the only constitutional mandate that would be there would be whether or not the traditional notions of when this Court does rehear a case are met.
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.171,2904.849,You are going to turn this last decision over to the counsel and take it away from the client?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2920.643,2925.467,"In that particular case, I think he is required to do so."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.467,2928.144,At public expense?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2928.144,2929.175,At public expense.
1973.73-786,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.175,2943.917,"You might get some help, if you get the figures from the Solicitor General’s office in six to the seven working days of the court to find out how many petitions for rehearing the United States has ever filed."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2949.126,2960.731,"Well, I would say that in most instances that the average defendant even after being advised that you can't have rehearing would not take advantage of that and would call as counsel’s advice."
1973.73-786,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2960.731,2965.198,Is it really fair on the constitutional question for us does it?
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,2965.198,2978.75,"It does, if you are worried about the balancing of the burden is in the implementing decision as opposed to the mandate or the strength of the mandate, the constitution requires."
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.774,3019.984,"Would it satisfy here that if under the North Carolina rules a copy of the brief in North Carolina Court of Appeals and a copy of the opinion of the North Carolina Court of Appeals would be if filed in the North Carolina Supreme Court would be an adequate filling, would be considered a petition for certiorari?"
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,3019.984,3022.193,"No, Mr. Justice White it wouldn’t for two reasons."
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.652,3047.585,"Well, maybe but they could apply that whatever criteria they are going to apply to whatever is revealed by the papers filed in the Court of Appeals."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,3047.585,3050.689,Which would require the Court to take the task of reasons --
1973.73-786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.689,3055.695,"Well, that maybe that’s the burden on the Court that doesn’t create a constitutional right in view."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,3055.695,3065.49,"Well, it does in the sense that the indigent defendant therefore puts the Court to a burden which is more wealthy --"
1973.73-786,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3065.49,3078.085,"The North Carolina Supreme Court in it’s own rule that it shall be an adequate petition for certiorari denied here, the brief and the opinion of Court of Appeals."
1973.73-786,1,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,3081.418,3101.475,The only objection is that the defendant of means has counsel who can layout the contentions which he feels will catch the Court’s eye which will when the petition comes across their desk for review will be -- was so to speak jump out at the justice as opposed to here is another brief.
1973.73-786,2,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3134.796,3137.009,If Your Honor please.
1973.73-786,3,42356,thomas_b_anderson,,3457.544,3460.48,"Your Honor, thank you."
