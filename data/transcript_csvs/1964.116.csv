1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,128.967,134.437,"Now, before you did that, didn't you try to sue on your judgment in the Alabama Circuit Court?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,134.437,135.605,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.523,141.565,"Not you, I didn't mean you, I meant the petitioner."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,141.565,142.605,It was -- right sir.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.705,175.206,"And as the -- the Circuit Court, in your suit on the judgment, upheld the defendant's affirmative defense instruction."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,175.206,175.499,That's the way I understand it.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,175.499,177.308,They gave the merits to those rights.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,177.308,178.2,"Right, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,309.81,313.54,"There, though, they did not apply the law -- the compensation law."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,315.115,315.495,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,317.628,322.258,"You're applying -- you're trying to take the benefit of the Georgia law, aren't you?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,322.258,323.093,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,323.093,325.229,Except its procedural position.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,325.229,326.464,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,326.464,330.199,"And there, can you go into Court at all in Georgia?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,330.199,332.309,Not -- not in this Compensation Act.
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,339.462,341.648,Even the review or --
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,341.648,342.815,It can by review.
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,342.815,345.66,"In Texas, you go into the Board and then you go into the Court."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,345.66,346.202,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,346.68,347.884,Is that the same for Georgia?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,347.884,348.343,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,352.408,354.882,You have to exhaust your administrative remedy first.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,354.882,356.968,"Right, sir, right sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,357.214,383.769,(Inaudible) -- in the Georgia compensation statute.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,383.769,384.569,Yes sir.
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,385.861,394.047,Can you describe to me what type of (Inaudible) that you could not do in Georgia in Court under that statute.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,394.047,394.289,Right sir.
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,394.289,394.838,Isn't that right?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,394.838,395.991,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,395.991,405.674,"(Inaudible) do you have cases with whom that under the state dealing with its own common law with this problem (Inaudible) authority, isn't it?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,405.674,406.0,Well --
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,406.0,417.336,(Inaudible) since before the last day before he could ever be in Court.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,417.336,424.161,"Yes, sir, but the fact that the Court of a sister state does not have jurisdiction of its own cause of action."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,466.074,468.14,Was that under the Alabama death statute?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,468.14,468.766,"No, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,470.532,470.659,The Georgia --
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,470.659,478.066,The TCI where it was -- similarly it was an employee's right when he was injured by defective machinery.
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,481.218,482.487,Under the employee's liability?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,482.487,483.408,"Right, yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,486.246,491.13,"Alabama had provided, had it not, that it could not be enforced in another state?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,491.13,491.924,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,492.152,498.013,What you say here is that Georgia has created a liability in a case of this kind.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,498.013,498.675,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,498.675,502.852,But it's provided that it cannot be enforced in the law and the Courts of Georgia.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,502.852,503.743,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,503.743,506.524,You say that that's not binding on the other state.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,506.524,506.979,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,506.979,511.704,"That they, since they have the liability created, can choose their own methods for enforcing the liability."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,511.704,512.11,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,512.642,514.955,And you rely for that on Tennessee against Georgia.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,514.955,523.657,"That's one of the cases, very much, so that it could not deprive -- this Georgia statute could not deprive the jurisdiction of the Alabama Court, yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,523.657,529.865,What you mean Mr. Pope that the state court or any of the Courts in the Alabama state --
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,529.865,530.03,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,530.03,530.737,And that's the cause of action.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,530.737,532.802,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,532.802,540.415,"Do you disregard the Alabama statute, (Inaudible) so to speak --"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,540.415,562.518,"That this -- this Court in my opinion, in the Carroll versus Lanza case it so said that, sir, when it said that it could disregard the entire Compensation Act or it could supplement it and I don't know what the word “supplement” mean, but I would assume that it would mean add something to it, and I think it add no more than a way to enforce -- enforce this cause of action."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,580.132,590.127,"I thought Carroll argued (Inaudible) but I thought Carroll did, one of his (Inaudible) apply its own compensation statute."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,590.127,591.039,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,591.039,595.123,And this warrant could define the common law.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,595.123,595.841,Right.
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,595.841,601.434,"Now, this -- (Inaudible)"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,601.434,601.869,"Well, I admit --"
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,601.869,603.079,(Voice Overlap)
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,603.079,603.451,Yes.
1964.116,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.388,711.084,"Did I understand you to say, Mr. Pope, the Zurich policy covered liability only when liability was found under Georgia law, is that it?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,711.084,711.527,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.432,724.238,"Well, let me ask."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,736.494,738.564,"No, sir."
1964.116,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.579,747.068,"Well, do you say under this policy that would not make Zurich liable if --"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,747.068,747.48,Right.
1964.116,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.48,748.904,If the judgment were --
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,748.904,750.617,"-- were rendered under Alabama law, (Voice Overlap) right."
1964.116,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,750.617,755.046,"But, still wouldn't be recoverable -- wouldn't the judgment being recoverable against the employer?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,755.046,756.082,"He's insolvent, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,771.953,773.675,You say Zurich did business in Alabama?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,773.675,774.396,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,779.653,781.953,"You've got personal service, don't you?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,781.953,783.425,"On Zurich, yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,792.152,806.484,"Your question is, as I understand it, whether a state has power by the statute, recovery statute of this kind, the limit to recover it and the method it suggest has its own state administrative agents."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,806.484,807.221,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,807.221,812.574,"To limit it that thereby, deprives that case of being tried in any other state --"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,812.574,813.028,Right.
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,813.028,816.67,-- even though the Court has jurisdiction to that kind of a case.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,823.63,823.677,Right.
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,823.677,824.93,Do you see any difference in that?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,824.93,826.727,This is a transitory cause of action.
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,890.612,892.11,What was the ground?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,892.11,892.862,Sir?
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,892.862,900.233,What was the ground of the Georgia -- of the Georgia statute holding that Alaba -- that the statute was unconstitutional?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,902.695,902.772,In the Georgia case?
1964.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,902.772,905.007,What was the ground?
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,915.417,921.88,But the Court said it did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause in ignoring this part of the Georgia law.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.291,926.662,Yes.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,939.084,939.173,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.173,943.405,"And to see what's been suggested, if I understand, also by Justice Black's question."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,943.405,944.595,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.595,953.765,"Well, now, I'm assuming you're right on that for the purposes of these -- that this question which expresses my doubt."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,956.782,957.499,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.499,962.838,"And the Alabama courts -- the Alabama Circuit Court, when asked to enforce this judgment --"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,962.838,963.448,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.448,965.517,"-- refused to do so, didn't it?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,965.517,966.423,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.963,970.25,"Yes, we -- so, --"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,970.25,970.499,Right.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.499,976.565,"-- insofar that shows anything, it shows that Alabama has not chosen a policy which you said they have."
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,976.565,977.329,"Well, that it --"
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.329,979.061,This was a default judgment.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,979.061,979.439,Right.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.439,983.012,"And, when Alabama courts were asked to enforce it, they refused to do so, didn't they?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,983.012,987.665,"They refused to enforce the judgment, but not the cause of action."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.665,991.163,"Well, now, why did they refuse to enforce the judgment?"
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,991.163,995.299,"Well, Mr. Etheredge might as well bring the rest."
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.462,1030.009,I've -- I've delayed you with my questionings.
1964.116,1,36456,max_c_pope,,1030.009,1030.151,That's right.
1964.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.652,1036.089,Alright.
1964.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1036.089,1037.813,Mr. Etheredge.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1037.813,1040.479,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.633,1176.655,You don't --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1176.655,1179.196,The Georgia Compensation Act -- sir?
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.196,1191.597,Would you really be saying that -- wouldn't we really just be saying that the Full Faith and Credit Clause doesn't forbid or require it?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1191.597,1192.587,"Well, I think you would, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.587,1207.192,"If Alabama didn't -- decided not to enforce the Georgia law, I supposed to decide that way, but if it decided to try to enforce to do it, the question is, does the Full Faith and Credit Clause forbid it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1207.192,1209.225,The Full Faith and Credit Clause --
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.225,1210.625,Doesn't that have to be your argument?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1210.625,1212.188,"Well, I think so, yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.364,1257.511,What's the difference?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1261.251,1262.02,Right.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.02,1268.385,"But, the question is, what is Alabama's pol -- what is Alabama's policy in a situation like this?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1268.385,1270.296,In -- on the facts of this case?
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.296,1271.076,Yes.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1271.076,1281.136,"Alabama's policy is, expressed in Singleton against Hope, it is that it would not entertain the jurisdiction of a claim under the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Acts for that."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1281.136,1282.526,"But it has done so in this case, hasn't it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1285.166,1285.372,"Well, Ala --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1285.372,1286.7,In the Supreme Court.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1286.7,1288.97,In this case at the bar?
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1288.97,1292.239,"In this case, there has been a judgment rendered by the Alabama Court, hasn't it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1292.239,1294.388,The DeKalb County Circuit Court rendered it.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1294.388,1296.93,"Right, but what happened to that judgment?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1298.869,1310.802,"Yes, sir, because I attac -- the respondent attacks it and attacks it collaterally because it says that the judgment was rendered by the Court."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.706,1323.016,"Well, that --"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1323.016,1324.878,Sir?
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.878,1330.712,Could you -- the question of jurisdiction could have been raised and litigated in the Alabama Court.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1330.712,1331.497,Yes sir.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.497,1333.945,"And it wasn't raised and litigated, was it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1333.945,1335.052,That -- it was not.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.846,1339.494,And yet there was personal service --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1339.494,1339.873,Yes sir.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.873,1346.205,"There was personal service, the defendant could have raised and litigated the question of jurisdiction in the Alabama Court."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1351.483,1357.753,Because it's a question of the subject matter of the suit that the courts lack jurisdiction.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1358.562,1363.118,You mean the Alabama Court didn't have jurisdiction to try a case of that kind?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1367.454,1367.927,Yes sir.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1367.927,1369.556,Because of the Georgia law.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1369.556,1370.14,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1370.14,1378.883,"But can Georgia law, didn't they say in this other case that one state can't deprive another Court of its jurisdiction, the state of its court's jurisdiction?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1378.883,1380.201,"Well, I think that in certain cases --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1380.201,1382.779,I'm not saying what would have happened if you had challenged that (Voice Overlap) --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1382.779,1384.408,"Yes, I understand that."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1384.408,1386.004,-- if it had gone up to the Supreme Court.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1386.004,1396.978,"But, I'm saying that the Alabama Supreme Court in Singleton against Hope has said that it didn't have jurisdiction of this type of case."
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1396.978,1398.163,What was the date of that decision?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1398.163,1400.262,"Well, I think that was 1931."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1401.314,1403.166,But didn't -- I have to ask this question.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1403.166,1404.466,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1404.466,1410.724,Did that go in terms of jurisdiction or in terms of the common?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1410.724,1413.177,"Well, I don't think that was discussed in the case, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.177,1434.657,"No, I recall when I was on the New Jersey Supreme Court, we had problems of this kind and we held -- we dealt with them not in terms of jurisdiction of Full Faith and Credit but rather, in terms of the committee that New Jersey courts would give to a, to quote particularly New York Compensation Law in its particular provision."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1437.006,1437.464,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.464,1440.297,"Well, we're not talking in terms of jurisdiction, are we?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1440.297,1460.28,"Well, Singleton against Hope did not discuss it in terms of the committee but it discussed it in terms of its ruling on demurrer, just as the Circuit Court in Jefferson County when this judgment was brought before it stating that we, Alabama will not exercise the jurisdiction of a claim under the Georgia Act --"
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1460.28,1461.882,That's a very different thing.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1475.755,1476.184,"Well, I --"
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1476.184,1477.35,I think it's question of jurisdiction.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1477.35,1486.827,"That is true, but I still cite from the question of the policy of Alabama as to whether or not it would choose to implement the Georgia Act."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1497.025,1502.648,That goes -- that goes to the idea that this right and remedy business being so intertwined.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1502.648,1503.38,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1518.769,1522.361,"But then, you had Georgia on review."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1524.216,1525.06,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1534.667,1536.343,"That is de novo, isn't it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1536.343,1536.63,Sir?
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1536.63,1537.969,Isn't it a de novo trial?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1537.969,1541.109,"I do not think so, Justice Clark."
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1541.315,1542.189,Not like ours then.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1542.189,1543.265,Right.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1544.398,1552.664,"What you're saying in effect here is that you're may be right, isn't it, that you had a perfectly good defense for this case from the Alabama law in Singleton?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1568.0,1570.291,"Yes, sir, that's my argument."
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1577.283,1579.021,Why do you have to make that argument?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1580.433,1580.472,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1580.472,1581.541,It was a default judgment.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1586.887,1588.39,"No, sir."
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1588.39,1589.362,Because it was default.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1589.362,1590.201,Right.
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.201,1596.506,"Then as soon as they were litigated in this Court of the State of Alabama, the Circuit Court upheld your position, didn't they?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1596.506,1597.289,That's correct.
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.289,1599.44,"Well now, why can't you just rely on that?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1599.44,1599.847,"Well, I--"
1964.116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.847,1602.613,That's a later expression of Alabama law by the Alabama Court.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1602.613,1612.045,"Yes, sir, and I'm attempting to -- I mean, that's what we are relying on but, in an answer to that, I'm trying to suggest to you what that Court has said in some of the basis for its reasoning."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1626.604,1638.177,Do you think the judgment would have been any better or any stronger go in and litigate it in the law than it is now?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1638.732,1639.102,I don't know --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1639.102,1640.383,"-- it's a judgment, I suppose."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1640.383,1640.456,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1640.456,1641.109,It's the judgment.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1641.109,1641.609,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1641.609,1645.565,"That settles it, doesn't it, if it's a valid thing?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1645.565,1651.413,"If the judgment is valid, if the Court has jurisdiction, it would be valid, yes."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1665.309,1667.135,You'd have to go to the subject matter jurisdiction.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,1667.135,1667.466,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2064.471,2067.309,(Inaudible)
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2067.309,2069.221,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2069.221,2076.025,Why is it that Alabama ended up with an identical workmen's compensation statute?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2076.025,2076.578,Identical?
1964.116,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2076.578,2080.328,(Inaudible)
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2080.328,2105.859,"My position would be the same that neither state could enforce or would have jurisdiction of the claim under an action if it was brought under that other state, if Alabama had it because it is a well-recognized principle running back, Pollard, Bailey, TCI against George where these things are so united that you can't separate the provision of liability from the provision of remedy."
1964.116,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2105.859,2108.16,(Inaudible)
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2108.16,2109.22,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2109.22,2112.279,The complaint would have to be filed before the Georgia Commission.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2112.279,2112.806,Yes.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2186.797,2188.14,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Etheredge?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2188.14,2189.115,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2189.115,2202.945,"Suppose Georgia, instead of just being a personal injury case than a contract case, suppose they pass a law that they're asking Georgia, the courts should not try contract cases."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2211.245,2212.957,"Well, that would give me trouble, yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2213.239,2214.535,How would it give you any more than this?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2214.535,2215.666,"Well, because --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.666,2217.449,"Maybe it shouldn't or should, but why would it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2217.449,2230.403,"Well, of course the theory would be it's a question of whether or not -- on the question of whether they could set up all contract actions itself under a statute, as to re --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2230.403,2230.976,But if they did --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2230.976,2231.527,As to --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2231.527,2237.323,"If they did it and confide with Georgia law, they'd be in Georgia, wouldn't they?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2237.323,2237.992,"Well, that's right."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2238.977,2241.898,"Well, why wouldn't it be possible in Alabama?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2241.898,2242.3,Well --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2242.3,2243.398,Like you say this is.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2243.398,2254.572,"It would trouble me, but I think I would have to give precedent or allegiance or adherence to Georgia on the case if they said, “You first must exhaust administrative remedy,” because the con --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2254.572,2256.793,Suppose that that is the only remedy you could have?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2259.029,2259.266,Well --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2259.266,2260.473,-- before it went into the Court.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2260.473,2278.899,"I don't -- Mr. Justice Black, I don't think that's -- it may be and I don't want to -- but the point that I'm trying to say is that I don't think that's the issue because I don't think that you can refuse Court jurisdiction to any claimant's particular aspirations about the cause of action it's creating because Georgia --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2278.899,2280.015,"But that's what you're arguing here, isn't it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2280.015,2280.86,"No, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2281.739,2283.503,The course of action of some kind is created because --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2283.503,2284.718,"Well, to me --"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2284.718,2286.854,There's money involved and there's a due to pay it.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2291.198,2307.246,"But, Mr. Justice Black, if the Georgia Board is arbitrary or capricious, then the liti -- or the claimant before the Board has a right then to go to the courts, but he must first exhaust his administrative remedy."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.246,2315.139,"But suppose they've provided that in contracts in Georgia that you have to first exhaust the administrative remedy before you could go to the Court, but you could go --"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2315.139,2315.618,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2315.618,2321.227,"Later on, and they came over to Alabama and said “We live over here, he over here, and we want to sue him here.”"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2322.762,2323.831,I think it would.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2323.831,2324.337,You think it would?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2324.337,2325.097,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2325.462,2326.548,I think logically it would under your argument.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2326.548,2327.521,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2358.083,2360.369,Suppose they had that law -- let's go one step further.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2360.369,2360.445,"Alright, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2360.445,2373.887,Suppose they had that law but Alabama had decided they couldn't -- it would follow but it gave its courts a jurisdiction of contract cases.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2378.699,2379.172,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2383.29,2384.213,Would you be right?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2384.213,2385.239,Well --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2385.239,2386.349,It takes up the -- and it's --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2386.349,2386.801,Yes sir.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2505.124,2513.276,"Suppose it said the policy of this part of the Act was obnoxious if you're trying to go into Court, suppose Alabama said that."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2516.38,2519.564,"What the -- I didn't understand you, sir."

1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2528.867,2530.127,What if it given a judgment?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2530.127,2531.134,"Well, no, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2532.592,2534.069,I'm talking about this case here.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2534.069,2536.486,"Well, I know, Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2549.763,2554.127,"What you're saying now is that if you would've fought it in the DeKalb County Court, you could beat them."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2554.127,2555.669,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2559.541,2561.202,May I ask you just one other question.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2561.202,2561.528,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2561.528,2562.546,Then I won't bother you anymore.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2562.546,2562.947,"No, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2562.947,2572.455,"I'm asking this because of the vague recollection I have that sometime after the Georgia case, the case went up in Tennessee to this Court."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2585.483,2586.116,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2586.116,2586.897,What was that case?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2589.92,2591.024,I know the case.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2592.623,2593.252,"Well, I can't either."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2596.087,2596.892,I think that's right.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2598.035,2598.167,Alright.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2598.167,2602.936,"What I'm trying to say though is, of course the judgments before us."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.123,2633.731,"Well, what is the -- what do you conceive to be the normal rule of res judicata?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2638.103,2638.532,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.532,2639.259,In the case.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2645.21,2645.252,"No, I don't --"
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.252,2653.819,Mr. Justice Black asked you a moment ago that let's assume that you would come in here and had litigated the jurisdiction and had lost.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2653.819,2655.75,"No, sir, it would not decide it."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.75,2663.313,"Well, I know, but let's assume that you had come in, pleaded that -- pleaded Singleton against Hope and the lower court refused to go with you."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2663.313,2664.125,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.125,2671.644,"And you lost, and you say you'd go to your grave saying, “No jurisdiction,” and you didn't appeal."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2677.545,2678.595,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.595,2679.106,What?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2679.106,2679.628,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.628,2680.452,You would make the same argument.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2680.452,2681.074,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.074,2682.887,There's no difference between the two situations in your mind?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2682.887,2690.833,"I don't -- the point that I think if the Court doesn't have jurisdiction of the subject matter, and I cite the case of (Voice Overlap) statute --"
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.833,2695.673,You just say that -- you just say res judicata never operates again on jurisdiction.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2695.673,2698.047,"On the Board's judgment of jurisdiction, yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.957,2759.936,"He could have recovered more money under Alabama law, is that right?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2759.936,2760.975,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.975,2764.151,But could he have collected it?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2764.151,2766.03,"As far as I know, he could have collected it."
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.124,2774.226,"Well, of course, there must be some reason for somebody relying on the --"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2774.226,2780.262,"Well, presumably I recog -- I represent Zurich Insurance Company."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2784.482,2785.583,I guess you know it.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2785.583,2786.059,Sir?
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2786.059,2791.694,"I guess you know, it may not be material to you but he stated it, I guess it must be a fact."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2791.694,2796.397,"Well, I would say and he suggested that there was no coverage in the Alabama operation."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.407,2798.896,I mean about the insolvency.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2798.896,2803.256,"Well, he is suggesting, I suppose, that Lawler, the contractor, was insolvent."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2803.256,2804.228,Yes.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2804.228,2810.381,"But I don't see how that has any place with Zurich, ultimate responsibility over on its contract."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2810.381,2811.073,It wasn't.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2811.073,2811.816,"No, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.816,2812.444,It wasn't it?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2812.444,2813.092,Right.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.092,2814.381,It's not in the contract.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.381,2821.298,"Well, except that Zurich wouldn't be liable on Alabama -- under Alabama law."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2821.298,2822.078,In this case --
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.078,2824.047,Rendered -- on the judgment rendered --
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2824.047,2825.269,Would not be liable here.
1964.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.269,2830.25,"Zurich would not be responsible, as Lawler would argue, in this case."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2830.25,2838.769,"That's right, because Zur -- but because, in this case, Lawler, itself would not be responsible under this judgment and that's why we're here."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2839.775,2854.274,"Now, I wonder, Mr. Etheredge when an Alabama Court says “Well, we could give you a recovery, the injury happened here, under our Workmen's Compensation Act, under our common law rule but now, we'll pick something else out."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2865.686,2877.157,"Well, I think that they're giving recovery under the Georgia law that they just recognized that they'll implement or give operation to that cause of action created under that law."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2881.79,2886.745,Are you familiar with the principle for example if we apply in the national law cases.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2897.797,2899.647,"Well, it may be, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.327,2904.777,"Well, if that's so, then what is the whole Full Faith and Credit argument?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2904.777,2905.242,Sir?
1964.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2905.242,2910.317,"Then what is there then for the whole jurisdictional argument, if that's actually what they did?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2925.236,2929.88,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.88,2944.12,"What bothers me about that is, why do we not have to assume that that's what the state court did if that's necessary to see the constitutionality of the action?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2944.12,2945.322,"What is that, Mr. Justice Black?"
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2945.322,2953.676,"Why do we not have to assume that they rendered the judgment, they rendered it on the basis that it's Alabama law that authorized it?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2953.676,2957.603,"Well, the Alabama law, it was the point that I was making, didn't authorize it."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2957.603,2958.095,"Well, I know."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2958.313,2959.909,In Singleton against Hope --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2959.909,2959.925,I know.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2959.925,2960.264,The Supreme --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2960.264,2960.374,That's right.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2960.374,2961.425,-- Court had spoken --
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2961.425,2962.612,If you had raised it.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2962.612,2962.656,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2962.656,2963.298,If you had raised it.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2963.298,2964.071,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2964.071,2971.342,But you keep -- it brings me back every time to the fact that it wasn't raised because it is a judgment against it.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2971.342,2975.795,"Well, that is correct and we were not there so, therefore, we had no voice."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2977.805,2980.026,You had a voice if you hadn't been gone.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2980.026,2981.551,"Sir, that's correct."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2982.867,2988.844,"You'd go, just take your -- all of your case on the idea that the judgment would be bad in that count."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2988.844,2997.474,"Well, I think it's -- the Supreme Court of Alabama said we wouldn't entertain jurisdiction of a claim under the Georgia Act and that's fine on the Circuit Court."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2998.956,2999.722,Would it have been binding if you'd raised it?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,2999.722,3001.004,I think it was void.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3001.062,3002.742,"If you'd raised it, it would've been binding."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3002.742,3021.511,"Well, I just say in that regard that if the Court in DeKalb County, and we assert, did not have jurisdiction to administer or to implement or give voice or credit or credence to the Georgia statute and not having that power to do so, then the judgment is void and is subject to attack here."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3021.511,3023.33,Did the accident happen in DeKalb County?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3023.33,3024.866,It happened in Alabama.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.866,3026.96,Did it happen in DeKalb County or it hadn't happen in DeKalb County?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3026.96,3030.792,"They're certain, and there's a complaint says that it happened in DeKalb County."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3030.792,3034.831,"And under the law of Alabama, as I recall it, that's the county that had jurisdiction."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3039.615,3039.963,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3041.798,3042.435,Its law?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3042.435,3042.583,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3042.583,3044.208,"And, we don't know whether it did or not."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3044.208,3044.758,It did not.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3045.92,3046.663,How do we know that?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3046.663,3047.734,Because it says in the complaint.
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3047.734,3050.652,"How do you know that it didn't adopt it, just as Mr. Justice Brennan said?"
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3050.652,3063.031,"Well, it says that only paper pleading before it is the claims that under the law of Georgia, and the judgment reveals and reflects that he had to administer the law of Georgia."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3063.031,3064.163,That he had what?
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3064.163,3076.018,"Well, if you read the judgment and the complaint in the case, he makes an award under the Georgia law to the amount of $10,500 or whatever it was."
1964.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3077.915,3080.292,"Well, of course, the Alabama had a right."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3098.106,3103.113,"Well, I think if the Court would have their peculiar situation in compensation fee."
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3110.854,3114.397,It depends on whether the parties were under that statute jurisdiction.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3114.397,3114.571,Adopt --
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3114.571,3123.535,"Here, they were under the Georgia statute, as well as the Alabama but they adopted the Alaba -- the Georgia law as Alabama law and abide it."
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3123.535,3123.659,Well --
1964.116,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3123.659,3128.465,Can you say that's against the federal clause as announced by the Supreme Court if you didn't appear.
1964.116,2,39163,r_foster_etheredge,,3136.039,3131.981,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3138.935,3141.039,Yes.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3142.748,3145.033,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3214.976,3218.01,Hasn't the Georgia statute pleaded at least one?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3218.01,3222.05,"The substantive part of it was pre -- pleaded, yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3222.738,3226.625,Would you think that (Inaudible) under the Georgia statute?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3226.625,3227.474,I don't think so.
1964.116,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3246.786,3251.986,I thought your argument was that they rejected this procedure but adopted the statute.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3251.986,3253.109,"You're exactly right, sir."
1964.116,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3253.109,3255.563,"So it doesn't matter whether the statute is there or not, does it?"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3255.563,3280.932,"Well, that's it, but what I'm trying to say is the answer to the Singleton versus Hope Insur -- Engineering Company that there was no alleged Georgia law as a defense to this cause of action and it was presumed, as some of the Justices have said that they took and as the Pearson case also said, that New York took the corpus of the Massachusetts law and adopted it as its own law."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3309.566,3312.575,(Inaudible)
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3312.575,3312.931,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3312.931,3314.975,The pleading here is not in the record.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3314.975,3316.094,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3316.094,3318.282,And this is the written complaint.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3318.282,3318.796,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3318.796,3330.607,(Inaudible)-- which is not the Compensation Law of Georgia.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3330.607,3331.983,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3331.983,3334.836,How could Georgia do anything without competence?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3336.037,3337.066,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3337.066,3348.298,"And obviously to enter a judgment on this complaint to support the (Inaudible) in Georgia have in Pearson, would it not?"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3348.298,3349.032,Not in --
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3349.032,3353.624,"That would be the basis of the courts, what can be the basis -- when the plaintiff who didn't abuse it."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3353.624,3379.454,"Well, the Georgia statute is made up into several different section in my opinion and, according to Statute -- Title 7 of 429 of the Alabama Act, “On proving statutes of other states, you have got to have an expert or this statute has got to be filed on record in the Secretary of State's Office and this has got to be certified to the Court or an expert on the law of that state.”"
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3389.871,3391.909,That's the procedure in Alabama.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3391.909,3393.485,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3393.485,3395.279,Do you prove damages under a default judgment?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3395.279,3395.745,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3401.685,3407.865,They would be making substantive effort if they proceeded with the filing of this case (Inaudible).
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3407.865,3408.289,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3408.289,3408.696,(Inaudible)
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3408.696,3410.486,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3410.486,3416.096,(Inaudible) Georgia compensation statute?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3416.096,3416.575,I --
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3416.575,3419.241,That is the problem of this complaint?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3419.241,3428.408,"My idea is that if it does not, the -- it was not upon the petitioner to prove a defense that could be set up possibly against him."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3428.408,3429.392,I'm not talking about a defense.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3429.392,3430.152,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3430.186,3432.331,I'm talking about the claim.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3436.571,3438.285,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3438.285,3440.902,"Would you not have to prove -- forget about a defense, forget about the remedy."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3440.902,3441.696,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3442.15,3450.553,Would you not have to prove such benefits that he's entitled to receive under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of Georgia?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3450.553,3451.306,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3685.887,3693.483,"Well, how would you get around Singleton, assuming it has been raised by a proper demurrer as it seemed?"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3693.483,3694.383,"Well, I --"
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3694.383,3702.966,"Would you say -- isn't it -- do I read Singleton correctly that your Court in Alabama has said that where a property raised by a demurrer, the demurrer would be sufficient?"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3702.966,3707.112,"I made that assertion, if the facts in Singleton versus Hope were the same here, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3728.581,3731.206,"But, Mr. Pope, your complaint -- I go back to your complaint."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3731.206,3731.783,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3731.783,3735.988,You assert a right in your complaint under Georgia law.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3735.988,3736.973,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3736.973,3744.889,"There is no question before us as to your right, if you had wanted to proceed under Alabama law, but in Singleton, I have the Singleton decision before me --"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3744.889,3746.3,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3746.3,3753.125,And it says “The rights ought to be enforced at its origin and existence in the Georgia Workmen's Compensation statute.”
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3753.125,3753.393,"Right, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3753.393,3760.921,The remedies for its breach are recoverable in the manner provided by proper pleadings of procedure before the Industrial Commission of our sister state.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3760.921,3761.548,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3761.548,3762.997,Such remedies are exclusive.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3781.989,3782.202,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3782.202,3791.143,"Had it been raised by a proper demurrer, your law in Alabama would have been, as expressed in Singleton, to sustain that demurrer."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3791.143,3795.749,"It in -- it indicates that, except the one fact there was a common law action in this."
1964.116,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3814.4,3822.511,"I think the facts are stronger in support of Singleton in this case, had it been raised by a demurrer because the complaint expressly rests on the Georgia statute."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3822.511,3824.994,"Well, I see your logic behind it."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3857.004,3859.806,Is the Singleton case the last one that was decided?
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3859.806,3861.769,"Yes sir, on the -- on this one issue, 19 --"
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3861.769,3866.914,"And this when your judgment shows that the defendant's first filed an answer, filed an appeal."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3866.914,3867.637,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3867.637,3868.463,Through a lawyer.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3868.463,3869.269,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3869.269,3872.238,"Later on, on the day, the lawyer came up and withdrew."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3872.238,3873.719,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3873.719,3877.398,And they took and prove that the company knew it.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3877.398,3877.621,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3877.621,3886.793,And they then said it entered under the judgment by default heard damages with reference to the injuries and found that they were totally permanent --
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3886.793,3886.924,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3886.924,3889.736,"And rendered a judgment for $10,500."
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3889.736,3890.613,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3890.613,3895.745,That's all your judgment shows.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3895.745,3896.894,I believe it does.
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3901.263,3905.922,But what I'm talking about is that it doesn't refer to the law or anything else.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3907.736,3912.462,"Well, I see -- I think you are right in the view of the Pearson case."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3953.945,3961.483,Your reference to the Georgia law was that you want to recover the amount that would have been recoverable under Georgia law.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3961.483,3963.213,"Yes, sir."
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3963.66,3965.733,"That was your sole reference to it, wasn't it?"
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3965.733,3966.508,That was the sole reference.
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3966.508,3968.44,As I see it.
1964.116,3,36456,max_c_pope,,3968.44,3971.703,That was the sole reference to it.
1964.116,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4004.632,4006.64,Go finish your statement.
1964.116,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4006.64,4030.884,"When it came up, the dissenting opinion in that case in a footnote, Footnote 15, it said Constitution requiring blind and unfair application of the internal law, the place of making, which he was talking about a contract of course, is a return to that outmoded and territorial and vested rights theories of conflicts of laws long ago outgrown by our jurisprudence."
