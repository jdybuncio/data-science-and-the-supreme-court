2016.15-1191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.06,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1191, Loretta Lynch, Attorney General, v. Morales-Santana. Mr. Kneedler."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.06,18.45,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States Constitution does not confer U.S. citizenship on anyone born outside the United States."
2016.15-1191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.76,169.065,Is that an argument we heard much about in the Flores-Villar case?
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,169.065,193.4,"It was -- it was made at the oral argument in -- in Flores-Villar, and -- but we think it's also evident from the face of the statute. As this Court said in Nguyen with respect to another argument that the -- that the Court addressed there, it's important for the Court itself to look at the -- at the structure, text, and operation of the statute to see that the --"
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,193.4,202.415,"I thought, in Villar, the -- the government spent most of its argument talking about the differential treatment primarily on the grounds of statelessness."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,202.415,203.03,Right.
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.03,210.065,And -- and here your argument is -- the thrust of your argument is -- is somewhat a different need to ensure sufficient ties.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,210.065,211.75,What -- we're making both arguments.
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,235.72,263.67,"Why aren't men and women who are parents similarly situated with respect to their affiliation, their attachment to U.S. values? I mean, there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,263.67,264.1,Right.
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.72,325.61,"There are many cases, especially generations back when this law was on the books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came sometime after the child was born, and both the father's name and the mother's name might be on it. So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she -- if there is no birth certificate, and then the child, when they get the birth certificate, both names are on it."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,325.61,370.3,"But I -- I think this Court's decision in Nguyen and the -- and the State statutes that we identify in a footnote in our brief are premised on -- on the proposition that the identity of the mother and her relationship to the child will be known by virtue of the birth alone, or at least will be known in the overwhelming majority of cases. In that situation there is only one parent. There is not a competing claim of citizenship to -- a competing claim of allegiance to another country through another parent. On the other hand, when the father legitimates, at that point you have two parents, and it -- in the situation where they are of different nationalities, then you are put in the situation where there are competing claims --"
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,370.3,377.56,"But why do we look, Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth? Why shouldn't we look to the moment when citizenship is sought?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,377.56,407.615,"Because this -- this statutory provision specifically deals with citizenship at birth, and the -- the statute that that's its caption, of 1409(a), with respect to the situation where the father legitimates, says the child shall be a citizen as of birth, and it's important to understand exactly what is operating here. At -- at the moment of birth, again, the child only has one -- one parent."
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.39,465.6,"But Nguyen -- Nguyen was more a matter of -- of proof, whereas this case, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, is a question of which -- does the child have sufficient ties to the country. It's quite a different -- quite a different proposition that the two address, it seems to me."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,465.6,471.57,Two -- two things about that. This Court's decision in Nguyen had two -- had identified two separate interests.
2016.15-1191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,500.69,516.78,"The problem is with the exception that's been created for unwed-citizen mothers, the first prong, the interest of the connection to the United States doesn't exist, because the statute doesn't require any connection to the United States except U.S. citizenship."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,523.08,528.35,"No, not under the 1952 Act. Under the -- that was true under the 1940 Act."
2016.15-1191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.28,559.645,So why should it be different for an unwed father who has legitimized the child?
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,559.645,563.71,Because in that situation there are two parents.
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,587.94,607.945,"Why couldn't that have been done, Mr. Kneedler? Why couldn't these objectives have been served through entirely gender neutral language? For example, I know that there was a proposal that the Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at all."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,607.945,608.95,Right.
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,626.39,661.0,"That would get rid of the gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint. Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the question here is whether the statute makes -- constitutes a violation of equal protection. One question we ask when we think about a question like that is, could Congress have written the statute? Could Congress have served its objectives in an entirely gender neutral way? And it seems as though here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a statute to Congress that actually did that."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,661.0,661.25,Yes.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.54,728.68,"There's a lot of complicated things, but the question I think is, think of the child."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,756.48,759.68,"But that's the same rule that applies if the parents are married, which is --"
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,759.68,762.94,Two -- two wrongs don't make a right.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,762.94,767.115,"Well, but -- I don't think it -- no one is challenging --"
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.115,767.95,Perhaps.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,783.455,784.37,Well --
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.37,790.23,"And the answer that you give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was very well-written and brilliant -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.23,800.9,"-- and -- and -- but it went into this thing about statelessness persons, and -- and then we have, like, 17 briefs that say, no, no, that wasn't what the situation was with statelessness persons."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,814.76,825.94,"Well, the -- the first argument we're making, again, is -- is the point of connection to the United States, and that's where the married couple comes in."
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.145,833.325,Wrong -- wrong residency requirement.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,850.22,850.47,Well --
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.47,854.42,"I mean, in any case, you don't have to answer that."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,854.42,854.57,"No, no."
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.7,862.35,Lived here for 14 years and so forth.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,863.96,864.12,No.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,864.12,866.49,I don't want to argue with you on this point.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,890.72,891.42,No.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.99,917.345,I'm going to make an example where they never married.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,917.345,918.29,Well --
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.29,920.93,They -- they like living together without being married.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,922.49,928.065,"Well, under the 1986 amendments, it's -- it is easier for the father to acknowledge the child."
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.7,980.65,"Mr. Kneedler, you're -- you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952. At that time, the statute books were just shot through with distinctions between children born out of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the father."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1011.905,1012.34,Well --
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1012.34,1026.45,"And nobody thought until the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection. But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal protection."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1026.45,1032.34,"Well, insofar as -- I mean, there are two equal protection arguments that have been made in cases like that."
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.78,1061.06,My point was that the laws that existed put mothers and children born out of wedlock together and separated fathers from their children --
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1061.06,1061.39,Right.
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1061.39,1064.54,-- out of what the reality of their life was.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1064.54,1078.975,"And in this Court's decision in Fiallo in the immigration context, that was exactly the situation, and the Court rejected equal protection claims based both on -- on sex discrimination and on illegitimacy."
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1078.975,1082.33,That was not a claim of citizenship.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1082.33,1100.405,"It wasn't, but we -- but we think -- we think, if anything, it follows Ofar Sharar, because citizenship is -- is entering into the citizenry or the membership of our society on a permanent basis with rights to come and go with all the rights and obligations. But I -- but I also wanted to address your -- your question with respect to the domestic context."
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.895,1130.355,And the father did -- this father -- didn't the couple marry?
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1130.355,1131.31,"Yes, they did."
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1140.56,1159.96,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you this question: If the Court thinks that this statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, does it necessarily follow that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief that was awarded to him by the Second Circuit; in other words, the granting of citizenship?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1159.96,1161.83,"No, it by no means follows. And I --"
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1161.83,1174.64,"Well, could you address that? We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in the Flores-Villar case, but that was a criminal -- there, what was at issue was a criminal conviction. Here, criminal convictions are not at issue."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1180.275,1181.38,Right.
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1181.38,1182.67,The underlying criminal convictions.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1182.67,1183.19,"Right, right."
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.76,1199.415,"I take it that the thrust of Justice Alito's question is, what -- what is the remedy if we -- if we level up, then it's easier for both? If we level down, then -- then it's harder for both?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1199.415,1207.45,We -- we think that -- we think the Court clearly should not apply to the U.S.-citizen fathers the one-year limitation.
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.39,1228.86,"Well, are --"
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.86,1251.985,"One I could think of -- one I could think of, possibly, but I'd like your opinion about it: How many, do you think, unmarried fathers there were in 1952 who couldn't qualify under the long period of time -- eight years, you know -- and that's not so hard to do, if you're in the Army, because all your active duty counts."
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.47,1271.76,"You know, I thought -- I thought you said there were untold numbers."
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.76,1277.55,"Well, and there were the untold numbers, but that's -- that's true, they're untold numbers, and then that's not told."
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1278.8,1281.51,I'm trying to find how close we could come to a guess.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1281.51,1284.85,It's -- it's -- it's very hard -- it's very hard to estimate.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.6,1295.38,"Well, let's go back to '52."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1295.38,1298.27,It was like 70 million that take trips abroad.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.27,1318.365,"Let's go back to '52, and the couple is unmarried and it's a father who, in fact, would qualify if he only had to live here for a year, but he wouldn't qualify if he had to live here for eight years before the baby's born."
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.77,1334.285,That perhaps was not right.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1334.285,1336.26,We have -- we have wondered the same thing.
2016.15-1191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.26,1336.37,Yeah.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1337.575,1356.665,"The -- the only thing we were able to identify -- and this -- this is really not very closely on point, but the State Department told us that today, they -- they grant approximately, I think, 8,000 certificates of birth abroad."
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1371.08,1372.45,Could I -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.15,1373.605,Yes.
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.605,1381.59,"Could I -- I mean, we generally have a rule that when we find an equal protection violation, we level up rather than level down."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1385.105,1387.95,"That's been its practice, yes."
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1395.22,1419.63,"Well, I find one compelling reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice between leveling up and leveling down in one sense, because if you level down, this party gets no relief. In other words, you say, well, you level -- you just apply it prospectively."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1444.82,1462.33,"Well, several things. In this context in particular, there are serious questions about whether the Court can, but, at the very least, substantial reasons why the Court should not grant citizenship to someone -- effectively grant citizenship to someone to whom Congress itself has not granted it."
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1462.33,1465.04,It's not -- it's not citizenship.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1467.39,1470.57,But if it -- it -- it would have -- it would have that effect.
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1482.74,1486.215,"If Petitioner's parents had been married, would he be entitled to relief?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1486.215,1486.965,No.
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.0,1505.95,"If we were to -- if we were to level up, we would --"
2016.15-1191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.95,1506.92,Go ahead.
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1506.92,1520.16,"If we were to level up, the effect would be that Petitioner would be given preference over someone who was similarly situated except for the fact that that person's parents were married."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1520.16,1520.63,Yes.
2016.15-1191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1520.63,1529.67,"And if such a person were to then bring a suit, they would have a strong equal protection claim, would they not?"
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1529.67,1532.43,I -- I hesitate to say what they -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.43,1533.68,The claim -- the claim --
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1533.68,1536.31,It illustrates the problems of the remedy --
2016.15-1191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.31,1539.495,"Mr. Kneedler, the claim is gender discrimination."
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1569.46,1576.78,My only point was that there are situations in which the Court has found a constitutional violation but not granted relief. And -- and --
2016.15-1191,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1576.78,1578.78,But not really a situation like this.
2016.15-1191,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1603.915,1617.135,"I -- I would like to answer that quickly and then reserve the balance of my time of -- of -- for rebuttal. I think it's also relevant, in taking into account the remedy, that this is not Respondent's own constitutional right."
2016.15-1191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1629.445,1640.385,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Broome."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1640.385,1646.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's father was a citizen of the United States."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.86,1764.82,"On this, but -- I would say at some point, the problem that worries me the most is, assuming this is unconstitutional, do you put the 14 years or whatever it is, ten years, on both, or the one year on both? And I -- I want to -- because he does have a point."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1821.5,1835.25,"Justice Breyer, let me address the last question first. The word ""continuous,"" I do not think, would -- is going to -- as a practical matter, it can't be applied in a way that somebody would have to come forward and prove that they were in the United States for 365 days."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.375,1839.75,All right.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1848.17,1895.03,"Well, let me tell you how it was -- how it was applied in this case. So this case, when we were in the court of appeals, the court was -- th court remanded the case to the Western District of New York for a determination on that very question. Whether or not -- if -- if the -- in order to decide whether the court should address the constitutional issue, the court first asked whether Respondent's father would have satisfied the one continuous year rule. So we went to the Western District of New York, and we were not -- the government ultimately stipulated that, yes, because we have evidence of Respondent's father being in the United States, or in this case an outlying possession, from his birth in 1900 until the date of his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1919, we will -- we will presume that there was at least some period in there where he was in the United States for one continuous year."
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.905,1930.75,"If we leveled down and made it harder, would that affect the status of people who have obtained citizenship under the more lenient provision applicable to the mother?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1930.75,1951.04,"Justice Kennedy, if this Court applied the leveling down remedy in a way that -- in a way that would actually equalize the -- the two similarly-situated classes here, it would have to -- yes, it would impact people dramatically because it would take citizenship away from people who already have it. And the Court has held --"
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.04,1960.555,"Well, it's not necessary -- I assume it could be prospective because once you have citizenship, it's -- we -- we have cases that say it can't be taken away."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1960.555,1961.05,Right.
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.75,1965.865,So it would just be prospective by reason of that doctrine.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,1965.865,1974.95,"You could not apply a prospective remedy in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it would not affect anybody whose citizenship was governed by the 1952 Act."
2016.15-1191,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1984.175,1997.09,"I mean, the problem, isn't it, Mr. Broome, that the very inequality that you are complaining of would remain, because it's impossible to claw back everybody else's citizenship, so it's really impossible to level down."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2001.185,2006.59,"That's right, Justice Kagan. The government's proposal, the prospective remedy is no remedy."
2016.15-1191,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2014.565,2019.84,"But it's not just that it doesn't give you citizenship, it's that it doesn't cure the inequality at all."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2019.84,2020.06,But --
2016.15-1191,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2020.06,2022.19,Either by leveling down or by leveling up.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2022.19,2022.71,That's right.
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.995,2090.845,"What about the argument that in most of the cases where a benefit was extended, the -- the group that -- to which the benefit was extended was a smaller group than the group that already got the benefit, and here, if you add in married parents, then most people are under the more difficult rule, ten years or whatever it is, and it's the smaller group that gets the benefit."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2090.845,2091.8,Right.
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2091.8,2097.455,So you would be extending a benefit enjoyed by a smaller group to a larger group.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2097.455,2107.47,"Well, we're not -- we're not asking for -- the remedy we would propose, Justice Ginsburg, would not affect marital couples, and the government has pointed out --"
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.47,2116.665,"But wouldn't you have an anomaly, then, that parents who are not married are preferred to parents who are married?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2116.665,2134.845,"It -- it does appear at first that there is an anomaly there, but that anomaly is built into the statute as we see it today. The -- if you take the case of the unmarried mother, if she marries the father the day -- the day before the child is born, the ten-year requirement applies."
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2140.88,2155.22,"Well, that is true, but isn't it something else when we devise a remedy that deepens and extends an equal protection violation? Have we ever done that?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2155.22,2159.89,"Well, I don't think the Court would be extending the -- the equal protection violation."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.9,2163.47,"Whatever it is, it wouldn't be gender discrimination."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2163.47,2167.51,"It wouldn't be -- it could possibly be a legitimacy discrimination, but I think that that --"
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2167.51,2170.225,"Well, it would be a legitimacy discrimination."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2183.225,2185.21,It's also intermediate scrutiny.
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2185.21,2196.4,And have we ever said there would be a different level of scrutiny if the discrimination was against children who were born to married parents? Would you make that argument?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2196.4,2205.205,"No, I wouldn't make that argument, but I -- I think that that claim, that legitimacy claim could be brought by people today, people who are born to unmarried United States-citizen mothers."
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2205.205,2205.41,Yeah.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2218.11,2220.87,"Well, it -- it would -- that same claim could be brought today."
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2277.24,2281.48,And you think that was Congress' intent in 1952?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2281.48,2283.8,I think in 1940 when -- when this --
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2283.8,2286.47,In 1940 you think that was Congress' intent.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2286.47,2311.14,"I think that in Congress' intent, what we've seen from the historical record, Justice Alito, is that in 1940, when Congress passed the statute, it -- it was concerned about nonmarital children being separated at the borders from their -- from their guardian parents. The problem is that Congress assumed or the -- the administrative officials who enact -- or drafted the statute assumed that the -- the guardian parent was always going to be the mother."
2016.15-1191,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2311.14,2326.665,"I mean, you can conceive the -- the possibility of members of Congress in 1940 or 1952 taking the floor and arguing, you know, we need to discriminate against the children of married parents, and in favor of the children of unmarried parents."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2326.665,2329.99,"No, I -- I don't think that's what was going on at all."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.99,2337.66,They were giving -- they were -- the one thing I think is they were giving a benefit to the unmarried mother.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2337.66,2339.12,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and the --"
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2339.12,2341.0,Because they thought she was different from the unmarried father.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2341.0,2363.46,"They -- they presumed that she would be -- that's a reflexive assumption that the mother -- at that time, it was a reflexive assumption -- I don't think it's as true today -- but that the mother was going to be the guardian parent, and they wanted to make sure that -- that the physical presence requirements that -- that Congress was passing were not going to have the impact of separating that nonmarital child from who they presumed to be the parent."
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.46,2380.18,"Suppose -- suppose there were some statistics that would indicate that over 100,000 new citizens would qualify or new persons would -- would qualify for citizenship if -- if we adopted leveling up."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2382.84,2385.84,"I don't think it -- I don't think it should, because at the end of the -- at the --"
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.84,2386.89,"And outside would gain 200,000."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2386.89,2393.44,"Ultimately, I think the Court has to decide whether or not there is an equal protection violation here, whether or not --"
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.44,2397.19,Don't we have to consider what the Congress likely would have intended?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2397.19,2424.935,"Yes, and -- and I think what the record shows is that given Congress' purpose here -- in fact, if you take either the purpose that -- that we have argued was the purpose of Section 1409, and the purpose that the government has argued, the statelessness purpose, both of those purposes are served by the remedy we -- we propose, by extending the benefits to unmarried -- unmarried fathers."
2016.15-1191,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2424.935,2426.455,Mr. Kneedler --
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2426.455,2427.115,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2444.64,2449.01,If -- only if they satisfied all -- all -- all the other statutory requirements.
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2449.01,2451.5,Which means? The answer is yes?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2451.5,2454.19,"Yes, yes, if they satisfied the other statutory requirements."
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.19,2455.475,The continuous one year.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2455.475,2457.04,And the legitimation requirements.
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.04,2457.94,And the legitimacy.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2457.94,2458.235,Yes.
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2458.235,2472.85,"More than that, I think it would be -- at first the father would have had to have sired this child abroad, would have had to recognized the child, would have had to support the child."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2472.85,2474.51,"That's correct, yes."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2474.51,2475.69,So I don't think that --
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2475.69,2485.565,"We're talking about a fairly limited class, I think here, Justice Ginsburg, and I -- I would like to turn to the government's arguments about the U.S.-connection interest."
2016.15-1191,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2485.565,2496.02,"But before you -- before you do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the natural remedy of something that it is holding."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2535.71,2542.765,"I -- I think, Justice Kagan, first and foremost, the Court needs to remedy the equal protection violation suffered by the parties."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.265,2562.53,What relief -- the relief would have been granted to this person.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2564.75,2565.79,Right.
2016.15-1191,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.765,2603.825,"Justice Kagan's suggestion, Congress apparently should -- should have been aware of this after our Flores-Villar, but they were soporific. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2603.825,2619.81,"But what we have seen, Justice Kennedy is that since the date that this discriminatory provision was first enacted in 1940, it has consistently -- Congress has consistently reduced the burden on -- on fathers."
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.23,2643.435,"Well, but, I mean, that argument seems to me that, in other words, they have considered the issue several times, and at no point did they take the step of eliminating it."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2643.435,2663.145,"That's -- that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but they also haven't been confronted with a -- the last time that Congress considered the statute was in 1986, and it -- and it -- an equal protection challenge to these physical presence requirements was not -- was not made until the Flores-Villar case."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.1,2694.095,"Why -- why -- why did you use the word ""today""? I thought what we were supposed to do is go back and figure out if they had known that it was unconstitutional to give the unmarried woman a year requirement to live in the United States, but to give the unmarried man where he is a citizen eight years' requirement, suppose they had known that was unconstitutional then, what would they have done then? Is it then or is it now?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2694.095,2695.36,"Well, I think it's --"
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2695.36,2697.91,"It's a lot easier for you if it is now, I think."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2697.91,2698.73,I think it is now.
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.73,2706.77,"But -- but -- but which is it -- is there anything -- I mean, you know, you are not going to help me if you just say that because that's in your interest to say."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2712.41,2722.96,"Well, as -- as a practical matter, I think that if this -- if the question is how would Congress remedy the statute, it -- it can only be remedied by the Congress sitting today."
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2722.96,2724.34,"Well, but that's not the question."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2728.34,2740.84,"And I think the answer to that -- well, the question is what -- is how the Congress would pass the -- if the question is how did the Congress that passed this statute, how would they remedy it today, then I think the answer --"
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2740.84,2741.8,Not how they would remedy --
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2741.8,2742.01,Sorry.
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.54,2748.2,What would their understanding have been about the appropriate remedy when they passed the statute?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2748.2,2771.37,"I -- I think -- I think the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that they -- they -- they were -- they were -- were concerned that the physical presence requirements would create a significant burden on -- on marital children, and that is why they lowered the requirements for the mother, because they presumed the mother was going to be the guardian and that -- and they -- and they presumed that the child should stay with mother."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.775,2794.34,"What the Court -- the Congress in '40 or '52 would do is strange in this context, because the Court -- the Congress sitting then took gender-based lines for granted."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2794.34,2795.765,That's right.
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.68,2830.29,"So do -- do I understand you to agree that when we approach these questions, severance and remedy, that we do look at what the Congress at the time when they passed the law would have done?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2830.29,2833.945,"I'm not sure if there is a clear answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.16,2844.15,Did you find any case which supports that?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2844.15,2845.24,"No, I haven't."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.24,2847.23,Did you find any case against it?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2847.23,2849.32,"No case for it or against it, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.32,2855.32,We're going to find lots of cases when we address this question that talks about the intent of the Congress that passed the statute.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2855.32,2860.995,"Certainly -- certainly there are plenty of cases on -- on that, Mr. Chief Justice. But the --"
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.995,2864.96,"And I don't think there are any, but -- you haven't found one, and I don't think anyone could find one."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2864.96,2865.07,But --
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.07,2874.24,"But let's say, when we're looking at a question of congressional intent and a question of this, we look at what a Congress 60 years later would have thought."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2874.24,2875.96,But if -- as -- if we are looking at --
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.96,2920.905,"Is that true -- is that true of, say, Westcott when they -- the category was unemployed father and -- and it was enlarged to include unemployed mothers? Is it true of Goldfarb, the Social Security cases when -- what Congress did when it did it was just a piece with everything where the man was the dominant person in the family and the woman was the subordinate person. So to say we want to go back to a Congress that had that mindset and ask what they would have done is a little hard."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2920.905,2923.735,"It is difficult, and -- and --"
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2923.735,2933.425,"Well, then don't pretend that you're implementing Congress' intent when you say we're going to -- we're going to put in place when we're talking about a remedy, not in terms of finding a violation."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2938.98,2946.935,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, when you are remedying a gender-discriminatory statute by leveling up or leveling down, you are never implementing Congress' intent."
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.42,2947.79,That's true.
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.365,2972.755,So that would move them in one direction.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,2998.955,3001.855,"As to Congress' intent, yes, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3001.855,3019.97,"As to the number -- number of people, all you can say is they would have to meet a lot of requirements that you would have -- the U.S. citizen sired a child abroad, recognize that child, supported that child, and --"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3019.97,3020.69,Right.
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3036.895,3046.97,Perhaps you're assuming Justice Ginsburg's point that the father still has to have legitimatized the child without marriage.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3059.795,3063.32,We're not -- we're certainly not challenging the legitimation requirement.
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.32,3067.915,Is that -- that's statutory and also the support requirement.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3071.35,3077.68,"And I think in this case they could be, because this is -- this is a different requirement than -- than what was at issue in the Nguyen case."
2016.15-1191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3129.4,3131.52,Or if she is already married.
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3131.52,3134.51,Or if she is already married.
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.51,3139.79,Where is the legitimation requirement? I see 8 U.S.C. 1409(c)
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3141.6,3143.145,It's in 1409(a).
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.145,3146.465,"Well, 1409(a) doesn't apply."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3149.82,3150.62,Right.
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3151.36,3176.46,"It says: ""Notwithstanding subsection (a), somebody who is born outside the U.S. out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of his mother if the mother is a U.S. citizen and had been physically in the United States for one year."" So I don't see anything that says they have to be legitimized for the mother to get that."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3176.46,3179.795,"In 1409(a), it applies only after -- after there's been --"
2016.15-1191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.795,3181.06,In 1409(a)
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3189.41,3190.67,"Well, no. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3190.67,3206.89,"Let me see if I can try and help you, Justice Breyer. The remedy imposed by the Court of Appeals is to -- as 1401(a)(7), which the -- the physical-presence requirement, the ten- and five-year physical-presence requirement, the Court of Appeals -- that -- that applies through 1409(a)"
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3332.14,3344.505,"Well, we aren't leaving children uncovered whose mothers have not had a continuous one-year residency in the United States, even though that mother may be an American citizen."
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3344.505,3345.72,That's -- that's right.
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3355.38,3364.635,"I just said they do. Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's been in the United States continuously for one year prior to the birth of the child, correct?"
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3364.635,3365.38,That's correct.
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3365.38,3371.605,So what happens to a citizen mother who can't meet that one-year requirement? What happens to her child?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3371.605,3374.05,That -- that child could be stateless.
2016.15-1191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3375.07,3378.01,So there is a risk of statelessness no matter what?
2016.15-1191,1,62764,stephen_a_broome,,3378.01,3391.17,"There is a risk of statelessness, but that risk of statelessness is created by these physical-presence requirements that Congress chose to impose, whether it's the mother or the father. The risk is greater with respect to the fathers."
2016.15-1191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.82,3409.67,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Kneedler."
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3409.67,3414.065,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, on the merits."
2016.15-1191,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3452.96,3472.66,"But if you're concerned about the stateless children in the world, then -- if -- if you have a problem with the father who can't transmit his citizenship in a country where women citizenship goes by who is the father."
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3472.66,3481.23,"Well, it -- it -- if the -- if the father later legitimates, he's put in the same position as if the -- if they were married at the time the child was born."
2016.15-1191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3486.15,3490.76,But today there are -- today there are lots of fathers who do look after their children.
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3493.25,3494.22,"No, but all --"
2016.15-1191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3494.22,3503.285,"Now, suppose just the words you said, take the same words, just put in ""father"" instead of ""mother,"" and today why is it any different?"
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3503.285,3505.18,"Well, it -- it isn't different."
2016.15-1191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3511.07,3512.71,I'm not talking about legitimacy.
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3521.8,3522.32,"Well, certainly --"
2016.15-1191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3522.32,3523.14,So that's one focus.
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3531.095,3531.4,No.
2016.15-1191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3548.53,3550.29,Doesn't (c) say that? Doesn't (c) say that?
2016.15-1191,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3550.29,3550.55,Yes.
2016.15-1191,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3592.47,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
