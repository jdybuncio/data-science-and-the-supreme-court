1981.80-6045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.981,We will hear arguments next in Kremer against the Chemical Construction Corporation.
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,80.702,81.483,Thank you.
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.644,153.329,"Do you contend that Title 7 was an implied repeal of Section 1738, the full faith and credit statute?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,153.329,159.825,"I don't really think it is necessary for the Court to address the questions in those terms, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.825,163.465,"Well, let's address them in those terms for a moment."
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,165.386,187.815,"Well, the entire statutory scheme of Title 7 presupposes a system in which there is first a state proceeding, then a proceeding before the EEOC, then a proceeding in federal court, and I think what Congress intended was that all three of those steps should be given their full force and effect."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.815,199.967,"Well, certainly, but the full force and effect of the review by the appellate division in New York would not be given full effect if your contention prevails, would it?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,199.967,204.105,"Your Honor, I disagree with that."
1981.80-6045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.0,317.466,"Counsel, I suppose that a formal hearing could have been held had the Petitioner requested it."
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,317.466,321.807,"No, that is not quite right, Justice O'Connor."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.365,376.16,Why do you think it is helpful?
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,376.16,388.328,"I think it is helpful, Your Honor, because, as this Court recognized last year in Gaslight Club against Carey, the state procedure is really the whole."
1981.80-6045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.171,436.591,Would your position be different here if the court review was de novo?
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,436.591,442.166,"Your Honor, that would obviously be a very different case from this case."
1981.80-6045,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.166,443.994,"So your answer is yes, it would be?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,443.994,446.336,"No, I don't think that it would be."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.004,498.612,"None of those cases involved a state court determination, though, did they?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,498.612,500.299,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1981.80-6045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,500.299,510.294,"In that regard, Section 1738 really only refers to a state judicial proceeding, does it not?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,510.294,514.152,It is true that that is what Section 1738 refers to.
1981.80-6045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.124,572.723,"Going back to the state proceedings in this case, which you addressed a few minutes ago in response to my question, would you say that it is somewhat in the nature of a summary judgment proceeding that at least the petitioner had an opportunity to offer testimony or affidavits or such things to avoid the result that occurred, and simply didn't do it?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,572.723,577.861,"No, I don't think that that is quite a fair analogy."
1981.80-6045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,601.618,607.193,Are you saying that he could not have offered such evidence to the state agency?
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,607.193,617.002,"I suppose if he could have stolen it, he could have gotten it, but he didn't have any way to get it and put it before the state agency."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.885,639.993,But the agency had the power to compel the Respondent to produce records.
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,639.993,642.851,If the agency decided that that is what it wanted to do.
1981.80-6045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.179,777.545,"If he had been afforded the full hearing on all the claims he is now seeking to make at the state level, and that were reviewed in the state appellate court, would your position be the same as it is today, that there still is a de novo--"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,777.545,780.45,"It would be the same, Justice O'Connor."
1981.80-6045,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.735,816.42,"--You said, Mr. Barrett, did you, that the claimant can't force the agency into discovery proceedings?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,816.42,818.638,"That is essentially correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,818.638,822.621,That belongs... that determination has to be made by the agency.
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,822.621,823.074,Yes.
1981.80-6045,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,823.074,842.956,"But had the agency engaged in extensive discovery proceedings, and they had been the basis of the decisions both administratively and in the appellate division, then I gather the district court, when the claimant came back there, would be in a position to perhaps say, well, there is nothing more to be done?"
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,842.956,847.581,"That is exactly right, and the Respondent perhaps could move for summary judgment on that basis."
1981.80-6045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.233,934.42,"To federal employees, you mean."
1981.80-6045,0,20588,david_a_barrett,,934.42,936.934,"--It wasn't just the federal employees, Justice Brennan."
1981.80-6045,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1091.184,1093.76,Very well.
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1110.958,1135.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as the United States and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission see the matter, the holding below is inconsistent with two aspects of Title 7's scheme and policies, and is contrary to the rationale of at least three of this Court's Title 7 decisions."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.386,1138.634,"Mr. Wallace, I am just curious, the way you put it and the way it is in your brief."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1143.321,1143.929,That is correct.
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.929,1145.96,Those are two different--
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1145.96,1149.537,"Well, we have joined together."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.721,1161.187,--And so you would be here even if the EEOC wasn't?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1161.187,1164.265,"That is correct, but they have joined in the brief."
1981.80-6045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.265,1168.53,Does the EEOC have a right to carry on its own litigation up through this Court?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1168.53,1172.872,"Up through all courts other than the Supreme Court, by statute."
1981.80-6045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.897,1344.536,"Well, Mr. Wallace, take an entirely different area of the law."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1375.414,1382.662,It might apply in that instance.
1981.80-6045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.082,1434.454,What if the state court had found that there simply was no discrimination?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1434.454,1463.535,"Well, that would be a different question, and I believe that the scheme of Title 7 would not give preclusive effect to that, although weight would be given to it, but if I may finish my thought here, there is no attempt to re-examine in the federal court whether an error was made by the state administrative agency in dismissing a complaint under state law."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.09,1524.76,Don't you think 1738 covers collateral estoppel too?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1524.76,1530.008,"It does, but there is no attempt being made to--"
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.008,1552.015,"I don't understand how you can say that... if there had been a de novo determination in the state court that there had been no discrimination, the very fact that is at issue in the federal case, I can't believe you are suggesting that Title 7 then nevertheless mandates that that independent determination is not binding."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1552.015,1557.467,"--That is precisely what I am suggesting, although it is not in this case, Mr. Justice--"
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.467,1558.076,I understand that.
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1559.792,1565.353,"--And I started to say, before 1738 came into the discussion, that Title 7--"
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.353,1566.196,--It has always been in the discussion.
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1566.196,1577.27,"--that Title 7 specifies that the EEOC, when it concludes that there is reasonable cause, has to attempt to conciliate."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.065,1586.017,What does your provision that you are relying on say?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1586.017,1592.499,It says that the Commission shall give substantial weight to the findings of a state authority.
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.499,1593.546,What does authority mean?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1593.546,1597.7,The statute doesn't specify it.
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.7,1602.759,"Normally, if you are talking about courts, you usually don't call them authorities, do you?"
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1602.759,1605.805,There is no--
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.805,1609.913,Do you have some legislative history that indicates that that includes courts?
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1609.913,1617.645,--The legislative history indicated that Congress meant for the complainants to use whatever state procedures were available.
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.45,1645.835,"That is one way of putting it, but it is nevertheless a court decision that would bind that person and the state, or and the other side He couldn't restart that case in the state system."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1645.835,1652.864,"--With respect to whether there had been a violation of state law That is correct, Mr. Justice--"
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.864,1657.425,"Or, he couldn't relitigate that fact of discrimination, even if he brought another cause of action."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1657.425,1661.876,"--If there had been a state court determination of whether there had been discrimination, which is not this case."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.266,1673.809,"Mr. Wallace, how can you say... suppose in this very case, after this very case, he brought another proceeding under another statute in the state, and his claim was he had been discriminated against."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1679.027,1684.196,"--It would be in the second state proceeding, because under state law--"
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.196,1686.772,"Well, then, why wouldn't 1738 pick it up here?"
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1686.772,1703.265,"--Because there is... there is no attempt here to invoke any other state remedy, and New York state law provides that if he elects to go to the administrative remedy he can't invoke a judicial remedy."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.761,1716.714,"Well, we are talking about a fact determination."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1732.52,1737.44,New York is free to decide what will be binding in its proceedings and what won't be.
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.44,1744.015,You are just saying that Title 7 did effect a partial repeal of 1738.
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1744.015,1757.729,"Well, I... I do think that 1738 permits for more specific statutes to be given their full effect, which is what is involved here."
1981.80-6045,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.222,1776.05,"Well, that could be put aside, too."
1981.80-6045,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1776.05,1786.498,"--the agency abused its discretion in dismissing a claim under New York law, and we will obviously have to stand on our brief for the remainder of our submission."
1981.80-6045,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.498,1789.388,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,1790.513,1813.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a claim preclusion case."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.571,1852.378,"May I ask, because I know you will get to it in a minute, but if there were no appeal to the New York court, but really merely just an administrative finding in the New York system, would you make the same argument you are making today but base it on 1739 instead?"
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,1852.378,1853.253,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.896,2118.005,May I just ask you another question?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2118.005,2118.817,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.817,2129.22,"Your position, as I understand it, then, is that if a plaintiff or a claimant loses in the state agency, he then has a right under state law to appeal and he might also be able to bring a federal suit."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2132.342,2132.811,That is a choice.
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2132.811,2133.576,--He has to choose--
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2133.576,2134.014,That's right.
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.014,2138.574,"--and if he goes the appeal route, he looses his federal rights, but he must make a choice right then and there."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2140.714,2142.713,"Yes, he has that choice, and I should--"
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.713,2147.727,"--But he must make a choice there, because either way he goes, it is the end of the matter for him."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2147.727,2159.925,"--Well, if he doesn't go into the state courts, he clearly has the right to preserve his right to a de novo action in the federal district court."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.925,2160.237,Right.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2160.237,2161.534,He just can't have it both ways.
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.204,2172.31,But he also really couldn't go into the federal court and appeal on the state court because he might lose on appeal while the federal action is pending.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2174.012,2180.401,"Well, Your Honor, I must say that he is only precluded from entering the federal courts for 60 days."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.118,2189.491,Provided he hasn't gone the state judicial route.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2189.491,2191.256,--If he has not gone the state judicial route.
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.256,2191.584,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2191.584,2202.159,"Now, Petitioner has said that in some manner Mr. Kremer here was directed virtually or told that he had to appeal, and I think that is a substantial misstatement."
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2305.225,2307.1,Subpoenas to appear where?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2307.1,2311.082,"At any stage of the investigation, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2311.082,2311.785,Before whom?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2311.785,2312.644,Before the division.
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.108,2329.607,Is there anything comparable to discovery proceedings?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2329.607,2333.822,"Well, the subpoena duces tecum... the following sentence says"
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.16,2356.502,"Well, it is not the kind of discovery in any event that he might have in your Supreme Court, for example."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2356.502,2356.659,--No.
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2375.105,2386.46,"I must say, I gather your position is nevertheless that if he is unhappy with the record that is made before the administrative agency, then what he must do when he is finished with the agency proceeding is to go right into federal court."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2389.693,2408.811,"With the following caveat, Justice Brennan, that if he believes that somehow the agency hasn't treated him properly, hasn't acted on a subpoena request, hasn't properly investigated the matter, he can raise that issue in the Human Rights Appeal Board and before the appellate division, which is what this Petitioner did."
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2408.811,2410.497,Without forfeiting his right to go into federal court?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2410.497,2414.871,"No, once he... he could raise that at the Human Rights Appeal Board."
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.871,2415.199,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2415.199,2421.211,"But once he goes into the state court, he is entitled to raise that question, but then he--"
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2421.211,2429.537,"What I am trying to get at, as I understood your position earlier, he can't go into the federal court once he goes into your appellate division."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2429.537,2430.052,--That is correct.
1981.80-6045,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2430.052,2431.942,For whatever reason he goes there.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2431.942,2433.489,For whatever reason.
1981.80-6045,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.155,2464.146,"Under our decision in United States against Utah Construction Company, the Court has held that there can be preclusive effect from an administrative finding as well as a judicial one."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2464.146,2466.661,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-6045,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.661,2484.545,So that isn't it possible under your construction that he could simply lose before the state human rights agency and then go directly into district court and still be precluded?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2484.545,2500.618,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so, because Congress has specifically said that for 60 days he has to go... he has to go to a state agency, administrative agency, and he still retains the right to come back."
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.224,2547.176,"Well, it said that he wasn't, didn't it?"
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2547.176,2547.848,It said that he was.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.848,2549.862,He was not precluded?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2549.862,2550.253,Not precluded.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.253,2550.831,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2550.831,2552.049,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.049,2564.778,"I know there is some disagreement about the scope of the New York judicial review, not too much, but would it matter to your position what the judicial proceeding entailed?"
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2587.269,2603.56,"I think it would be, because we believe that that really is up to the New York state legislature and the New York state courts to determine what kind of preclusive effect would be granted--"
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.56,2606.543,Do you think Congress intended to draw that kind of distinction?
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2606.543,2626.409,"--What we are concerned about, and we have said, is that we do not believe that Congress wanted to trap Title 7 claimants, and we do not believe that Congress thought that they should be relegated to second class kind of treatment in the states."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.361,2634.298,"Well, it is second class only in the sense that they don't have a right to appeal."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2634.298,2638.498,"--Well, but your postulate is a very narrow right of appeal."
1981.80-6045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.498,2638.733,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2638.733,2639.061,Yes.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.269,2721.23,You don't need to argue for any kind of preclusion here other than in a case where the state judicial proceeding purports to include a judgment that the discrimination determination was not arbitrary or unreasonable.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2759.543,2761.777,"--Yes, we--"
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.777,2763.041,But you don't need to make that.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2763.041,2764.135,--We don't need to make it.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.681,2765.493,You are saying that--
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2765.493,2765.524,We don't need to.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.524,2771.427,--You are saying here that the judgment of no probable cause to believe there is discrimination was not arbitrary.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2771.427,2774.66,"I would go a little further, Your Honor."
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.832,2781.392,"Do you have to... if you think you have to, you may lose."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2783.299,2792.421,"--I would just like to point out, Your Honor, in New York Gaslight against Carey, a decision of this Court, the state proceeding went to its conclusion through the New York courts."
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.737,2821.159,On the merits.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2821.159,2821.784,On the merits.
1981.80-6045,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.034,2824.72,That is as far as you need to go.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2824.72,2826.236,--That is as far as I need to go.
1981.80-6045,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2828.0,2861.487,"Mr. Layton, under your theory, now, I suppose that a state that basically were hostile to Title 7 claims could set up a system for these claims to grant, for instance, an automatic right to review in the state appellate proceedings for all these claims and then preclude everybody thereafter."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2861.487,2867.298,"You mean, compel all discrimination claimants to appeal--"
1981.80-6045,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2867.298,2867.843,Sure.
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2895.598,2897.176,--Slim.
1981.80-6045,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2933.723,2949.639,"Well, under your system, or your theory, a claimant might well be better advised to lose in the state proceeding rather than be trapped by an appeal at the state level."
1981.80-6045,2,39765,robert_layton,,2950.358,2956.433,"No, I don't... I don't really think so."
1981.80-6045,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.65,3040.962,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Barrett?"
1981.80-6045,3,20588,david_a_barrett,,3040.962,3044.585,"Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.80-6045,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3237.709,3238.475,"Thank you, gentlemen."
