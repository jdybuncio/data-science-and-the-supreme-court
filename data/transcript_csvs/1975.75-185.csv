1975.75-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.38,"We will hear arguments next in 75-185, International Association of Machinists against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission."
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,62.622,63.523,Thank you.
1975.75-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.029,459.46,(Inaudible) matter would seem Mr. Miller if the statute was directed against a typical “sit-down” that is occupying the premises?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,459.46,462.134,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, it would not be."
1975.75-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.747,467.475,I am not suggesting a statute that goes to the subject of violence.
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,467.475,504.911,"I think physical obstruction of a plant creates a series of state interest a fortiori of course to trespass that amount of physical obstruction, the exercise of physical force in occupying the premises, I see nothing comparable to that consideration in terms of state interest here, contrast to violence, the property damage, the bombings, the threats and other disorder, traditionally subject to state prohibition with entirely peaceful concerted activity of the workers in this case."
1975.75-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.779,603.115,What would you say if they all said they are going to go home a half hour early?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,603.115,606.118,Mr. Justice Stevens that would present a different situation.
1975.75-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.104,629.531,What I am searching for Mr. Miller and I am sure you will spill it up before you get through is what is the bright line that makes this difference in kind from Briggs-Stratton and Trespass.
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,631.641,634.153,Absolutely not.
1975.75-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.67,675.686,"If you go that far, that is overruling Briggs-Stratton?"
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,675.686,701.956,"No, I do not think Briggs-Stratton, I think Briggs-Stratton really stands today for a very, very narrow holding to the extent it leaves it all and that holding is that in conduct -- that the conduct of the Union of Briggs-Stratton was so crude so without redeeming interest that it could be assimilated to the character of violence in a labor dispute or physical takeover of the plant."
1975.75-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.812,736.945,"Of course, the dissenters in Briggs-Stratton thought it was protected activity?"
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,736.945,741.687,Dissenters in Briggs-Stratton and of course that was a very early decision Justice Stevens.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.003,834.92,Is your legal argument going to be that this is actually protected activity?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,834.92,836.793,We make that argument Mr. Justice White.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.793,838.191,What is your first argument?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,838.191,851.384,"Our narrow argument is that in fact in this case, Briggs-Stratton is totally an opposite because the conduct is so close to the center of Federal concern as to in fact be protected."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.384,853.128,You say it is actually protected activity?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,853.128,854.063,"Yes sir, we say that."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.063,857.093,That is your first argument?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,857.093,857.885,That is the narrow argument.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.885,862.229,So that means that the Court should reach whether it is actually protected or not?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,862.229,863.543,The Court need not reach that issue.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.543,866.238,"I know, but that argument indicates that you should."
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,868.931,876.063,"Well, our argument –- the first argument is that because this conduct is so different from Briggs-Stratton, it does not fall within the rule."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.063,877.858,Forget Briggs-Stratton for a minute.
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,881.091,892.755,"The first argument is Your Honor that this the broad argument is the first argument, the most important argument and that is that this is a self-help activity permitted by Congress in Taft-Hartley."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.419,909.694,What you are saying is that generally a state intervention in the area is generally preempt?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,909.694,913.655,I think it depends on the area of peaceful economic weaponry.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.655,918.088,You think the federal labor policy in this area is no regulation?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,918.088,919.002,No sir.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.344,929.198,"Well, I know, but the government should not touch it."
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,930.559,938.956,"Certainly not the State Government, Justice White, certainly not the State Government and certainly not for no interest other than to second guess the Federal balance."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.956,947.651,"Let us assume we disagree with you on that point, is your next argument that is actually protected?"
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,947.651,950.237,"The next argument is yes, it is actually protected."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.237,952.65,It is not that it is arguably protected?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,952.65,953.691,That is correct.
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.937,958.617,You do not argue the arguably protected point at all.
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,959.646,975.835,"Your Honor, arguably protected in our view is simply shorthand for the broader category and the broader theory we are referring to which is self-help weaponry, what Congress intended to permit no state can set aside."
1975.75-185,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,975.835,976.838,As in the Morton case?
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,976.838,986.037,"As in Morton Justice Stewart, as in Insurance Agents at least for the clear implications from it, and as in Florida Power and Light."
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.037,994.991,"But if we disagree with you on your first point, you then say, we should look and see if whether it is actually protected of not?"
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,994.991,1002.431,"Your Honor, what I am trying to get across with the respect of the first point is that because the Labor Board has found to be actually protected --"
1975.75-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.431,1004.013,I understand your first point.
1975.75-185,0,25767,gerry_m_miller,,1008.705,1025.836,"You still have to face whether or not Briggs-Stratton, the rule on Briggs-Stratton is sufficient to cover the kind of conduct here to be prohibited by state regulation and the entire thrust of my first argument is presented here was to try to dispel the notion that on the facts this can be compared at all."
1975.75-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.457,1035.781,"Very well, Mr. Miller."
1975.75-185,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1065.074,1073.749,I do not think that that would be protected by Section 7 of the Act against employer discharge.
1975.75-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.121,1149.388,Is there any issue about prohibiting the conduct or was it merely a question whether it was consistent with the good faith bargaining?
1975.75-185,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1149.388,1162.288,In Insurance Agent the question was whether or not the Board could find that that was a violation of the duty of the bargain.
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,1790.397,1796.476,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.164,1922.366,But this is not really responsive to your friend’s argument that as a general manner there is preemption here in Insurance Agents sense?
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,1922.366,1939.466,Insurance Agents in my judgment has no play in this case because what this Court held in Insurance Agents was that this type activity is not sufficient evidence for the Board to find the 8 (b) (3) bad faith bargaining.
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.426,1965.33,I know but the argument from the other side is whether this is -- even if this is not protected and even if it is not prohibited the state cannot touch it?
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,1965.33,1967.725,I understand that.
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.725,1968.637,"Well, what is your response to that?"
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,1968.637,1970.11,What we are concerned with here --
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.11,1974.516,"Because if on that basis, it would not make any difference whether you got access to the Board or not?"
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,1974.516,1978.532,Our position is Briggs-Stratton clearly covers this.
1975.75-185,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.532,2007.878,"The argument as I understand it, as I understand Justice White’s question to be indicating of your counsel on the other side is simply that whether or not this is argued, this is not arguably or actually protected in the sense of the Act nor arguably or actually prohibited, but it is simply something that Congress left to self-help and for that reason it cannot be touch by the state, is that not the argument?"
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,2008.758,2010.408,"Yes, that is clearly their argument."
1975.75-185,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.387,2012.006,"Yes, I know that."
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,2012.006,2014.742,I disagree firmly.
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.203,2025.923,"It is not a question of limiting Garmon, that is another issue --"
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,2025.923,2026.663,I understand it.
1975.75-185,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.663,2029.629,"And you better, I think if that is the question of the case --"
1975.75-185,2,32136,james_c_mallatt,,2029.629,2059.456,"I wanted to make that point right away because I believe by my reading of the cases that it is one of the reasons we are here today is this Court is extremely concerned with uniformity in the labor law, but it is also very concerned about affording the people of the United States, including employers a right to some sort of forum if they have what we feel is a legitimate grievance."
1975.75-185,3,25767,gerry_m_miller,,3399.685,3400.916,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
