1968.670,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.77,"Number 670, Fred Banks versus California."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,31.863,35.023,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,458.68,461.919,"Well, our mandate didn't say he should be given a hearing, did it?"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,461.919,465.973,He said for further consideration proceedings in light of Griffin against California --
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,465.973,482.452,"And so the question that you're presenting to us really as on your theory of the case is, what should those proceedings be a more specifically was the petitioner entitled to counsel --"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,482.452,482.942,That's -- that's one --
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,482.942,488.469,"-- for purposes of those private proceedings that this Court ordered on remand, that's number one."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,497.389,498.703,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,527.29,540.06,I notice -- I notice in your brief you've got very elaborate brief and you argue a lot of points but aren't those two points that I stated the points that are before us?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,540.06,540.298,The point --
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,540.298,557.116,"That is to say one, whether on the further proceedings ordered by us for purposes of considering Griffin against California's application to this case, counsel should have been appointed."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,563.43,564.317,"Correct, Your Honor."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,576.762,586.317,"Well, do you concede then that the proper standard for determining whether the error was harmless."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,603.928,604.521,"No, I don't."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,605.649,613.216,"Why don't you tell us as succinctly as you can, if you don't mind about what you think the standard is?"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,617.152,617.619,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,617.827,625.777,If you don't think the reasonable probability of a more favorable result standard is correct what do you think is the correct standard?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,625.777,633.685,I think the correct standard is the one this Court announced in Chapman that the Court must be able to declare beyond the reasonable doubt that the area was harmless.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.685,635.072,But what that means?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,635.072,637.665,That means that the Court has to look at the evidence.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.358,708.28,"But when this -- certainly the Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District of your state, when the case was before for the third time not the second time,--"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,708.28,708.523,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.523,714.861,"-- this is what Justice Fortas read, but for the third time, after it has been remanded in the light of Chapman."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,714.861,715.036,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,715.036,718.709,"First, it was really granted as I understand it the light of Griffin."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,742.636,742.942,It --
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.942,746.021,-- and was said to be in the Chapman case?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,746.021,756.055,"Mr. Justice, what the Court of Appeal did was repeat the language in the Chapman test but how could the Court of Appeal decide this case without hearing a lawyer argue the facts."
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.055,761.26,"Well, that's some – that's a depth question but I'm talking about the standard that they verbalized."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,761.26,764.741,Should the standard verbalize this -- the one that this Court is conducting.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.741,769.165,Does the standard enter the light for you under Chapman?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,769.165,770.041,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.041,779.527,What it means to me based on the conclusive evidence of what the Court is saying that if you look the record and see the evidence that took the evidence of guilt --
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,779.527,780.413,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.413,782.868,-- other than the comment.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,787.295,788.582,I don't believe that.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.582,789.714,"Well, isn't that what they said?"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,789.714,790.224,That's right.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.497,801.641,"If you look at the other evidence and is conclusive enough, you -- it doesn't make any difference about the error."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,808.321,808.887,I would hope not.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.557,833.712,How do you ever charge -- decide harmless error?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,836.545,836.774,That's --
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.774,848.245,How can there ever be a harmless error rule if you don't -- if you don't look at all the evidence to decide that it's so conclusive that this erroneous piece of evidence didn't make any difference.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,851.272,854.657,"I think you're agreeing with me, Mr. Justice, you have to look at all the evidence."
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.657,859.314,"Well, I know but it is that -- I think that's probably what this Court purported to do."
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,859.314,861.513,That's would it -- that's would it --
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,861.513,862.49,"Well, how would you state it --"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,862.49,863.182,-- appear to you.
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,863.182,863.987,How would you state it?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,878.006,878.466,"No, sir."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,878.466,881.392,But then it's not harmless beyond reasonable doubt?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,881.392,881.93,No.
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,895.715,897.37,"Well, the Court did that --"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,897.37,911.68,"-- if there is a slightest doubt that this comment might have convinced one juror, one juror to be the evidence against the defendant and that -- when you can't show that that error was harmless."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,911.68,912.203,I see.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,933.822,935.328,That's right.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.702,941.888,"And you further say that whenever you have comment on his failure to testify, there is such a basis?"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,941.888,945.595,But why is the prosecutor making the comment? He's not up there just beating his.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.595,946.124,Exactly.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,946.124,946.668,That's right.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.668,952.551,"But that I thought was my point of view in the Chapman case and I would hold by myself, you know?"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,952.551,955.739,"Well, I -- you got somebody with you standing over here."
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.739,957.762,But we have to overrule the Chapman case?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,957.762,968.011,I don't think you have to overrule Chapman to get it -- to get the reversal in this case because in this case there is all kinds of doubt the petitioner was the robber.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1174.806,1180.065,Where was the -- you're not suggesting are you any deliberate wrong doing of the --
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1180.065,1180.514,No.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1184.061,1192.31,Certainly and the conviction was affirmed and we -- it was remanded by us only for reconsideration in the light of Griffin which involve comment on his failure to testify.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1193.512,1193.641,No.
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1202.201,1202.819,What joint?
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1202.819,1204.032,-- the evidence isn't there?
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.972,1218.884,"When it was remanded in the light of Griffin, it was simply remanded in the light of case that it said that you can't comment on the defendant's failure to testify and it was limited remand but however, that's -- that's -- I just want to make clear --"
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1218.884,1219.275,"Oh, no."
1968.670,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1219.564,1220.162,-- what you were charging --
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1220.162,1220.569,No.
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1221.528,1226.288,What your -- let me see if I can understand this.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1263.476,1264.473,"Yes, I am."
1968.670,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1264.473,1268.483,You're saying that -- that is the advice in this standard.
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1268.483,1272.552,That is the exact advice in this standard.
1968.670,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.891,1810.071,(Inaudible)
1968.670,0,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,1810.071,1816.364,"Well, if you read -- if you see what the judge said during board there Mr. Justice."
1968.670,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1858.644,1862.058,Mr. O'Brien.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,1862.058,1866.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1939.525,1944.246,Can we ask the Court of Appeals for counsel?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,1944.246,1945.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.063,2014.54,Is there anything the record for the lawyer?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2014.54,2015.493,I beg your pardon.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.493,2020.189,Is there anything in the record from the lawyer?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2020.189,2027.762,The appointed counsel Your Honor on -- at the time of the remand did not file a brief.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.762,2030.384,Did he do anything?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2030.384,2031.362,"Ah, he filed nothing --"
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.362,2032.36,You just said.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2032.36,2034.886,"He filed nothing with the Court, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.886,2036.406,Did he argue?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2036.406,2036.878,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.306,2041.773,"Well, did he have counsel?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2041.773,2042.555,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.377,2044.757,How?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2044.757,2051.837,"He had been appointed counsel, Mr. Chapsky, by the Court of Appeals and on each remand."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.975,2070.308,But did he have counsel in any effective way?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2070.308,2081.476,"Yes, Your Honor, in the sense that he had appointed counsel and then it was a choice by counsel as to whether or not to file a supplemental brief on the Chapman case."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2081.476,2085.385,"Well, wasn't the case set back for that purpose?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2085.385,2088.509,To -- for the Court of Appeals to review in light of Chapman.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.205,2097.109,And I would assume that counsel on both sides to prepare to argue on that point.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2097.109,2097.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.21,2103.222,"And in this case, petitioner had no counsel on that point?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2103.222,2103.585,"Oh, yes."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.765,2114.747,"Well, show me something that he said, wrote or did, the counsel?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2114.747,2117.214,"He did not write anything to the Court, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.214,2119.82,Did he say anything to the Court?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2119.82,2120.474,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.376,2124.05,And yet you said that he had counsel?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2124.05,2124.768,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.959,2173.806,"What you really mean if he is so guilty, he doesn't need it?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2173.806,2174.136,"Oh, no."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.723,2178.238,"Well, you don't take the same position the Court did, do you?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2181.427,2181.992,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2184.9,2188.42,What was there last sentence and opinion?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2188.42,2210.139,"Your Honor, I believe the Court applied the standard laid down by this Court in Chapman that the question is whether or not the error -- in doing the error whether or not the Court could declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2241.049,2248.701,"Well, here you had some sort of a proceeding and this -- when this case was before the Court for the third time."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2260.943,2261.699,"Yes, earlier."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2262.577,2270.498,And if you consider this as part of the same record as this as one might.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2286.016,2287.023,"Well, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2304.498,2304.876,"Well, that's exactly --"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2304.876,2312.944,And the results also vary where in some cases there is no argument or brief nevertheless the case may be reversed depending on the nature of the case.
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2312.944,2324.28,Very well -- I've seen a lot of those cases in that's I guess one of the reasons for a good deal of interest in this case from heart.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2324.28,2324.96,"Well, yes Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2325.853,2327.155,You see what I mean.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2327.155,2327.866,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.62,2346.106,Don't we have the procedure in California?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2361.911,2362.752,"Oh, no Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.935,2365.342,"You couldn't say that, do you?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2365.342,2365.868,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.864,2371.356,"Well, would you commit it?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2371.356,2372.779,And in the -- in the letter --
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.779,2373.743,Was this submitted?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2377.501,2378.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.938,2380.027,How?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2380.027,2380.948,Ah --
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.948,2384.121,The only letter that I saw was the letter asking for a lawyer.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2384.121,2384.91,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.918,2393.871,Did he say they submitted and then won't argue?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2395.264,2395.894,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.223,2401.09,But why wasn't he permitted to argue?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2401.09,2402.343,Your Honor.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.051,2418.491,And so the counsel can waive his rights?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2418.491,2419.074,"Oh, clearly."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.519,2435.295,It is?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2435.295,2437.197,"In many cases Your Honor, in which the --"
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.197,2445.931,"Well, if -- well, assuming that the paying client says I want you to argue, what happens?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2445.931,2448.132,"Well, Your Honor that would --"
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.132,2454.644,"Well, if the paying client says, I'm giving you $25,000.00 more dollars, I want you to argue my case."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2457.844,2459.777,"Yes, that would be up the individual counsel."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.777,2462.562,Sure would.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2467.368,2468.216,"Well, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.687,2482.373,"Well, he didn't argue this anyway."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2482.373,2482.597,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.597,2484.195,Is it orally or written?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2484.195,2487.554,It was originally argued by counsel Your Honor before the Court.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.554,2495.673,"But in this one that's before us now, counsel didn't argue anyway, anyhow, anytime, anyplace."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2495.673,2498.084,He did not argue the Chapman issue Your Honor.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.822,2505.123,This time?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2505.123,2505.561,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.927,2507.358,I'm talking about this time.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2509.881,2510.065,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.065,2511.168,He did nothing.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2511.168,2516.474,"However, when the case is remanded it's back before the Court as a current appeal."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.474,2520.642,And his counsel did nothing.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2520.642,2523.077,"He filed no documents with the Court, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.077,2526.528,Did he do anything else in the Court?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2526.528,2528.961,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2528.961,2541.593,"Now, I wonder if you'd tell us whether there is a rule of the District Court of Appeal with respect to oral argument and if so, what is it?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2541.593,2564.337,"Your Honor, as all I know the question of oral argument is that it is not required in every case and that as a matter of practice oral argument in the Court of Appeals in California in many cases is not conducted."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2564.337,2576.629,I understand that but I wonder whether there was a court -- whether there was a rule of court that would indicate who has the option of making that decision.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2576.629,2580.767,"Well, Your Honor the --"
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2580.767,2580.999,"Well, I suppose --"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2580.999,2588.437,"No, I think it merely states that it may be done and does not particularize and in practice."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2593.608,2599.35,Do you mean just by the court even without asking the parties.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2607.233,2632.562,"Well, in this type of situation Your Honor, namely when we're dealing with the equivalent of a supplemental brief on a particular point as distinguished from the initial original appeal."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2638.892,2645.171,Assuming that you're wrong when you addressed without the lawyer what do you say about the rest of this case?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2655.126,2655.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2758.009,2765.612,But that's not the basis on which the decision below has rested by the Court.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2765.612,2766.154,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2773.263,2775.492,"Well, are you sure about that?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2786.825,2787.511,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.925,2792.85,"Now that requires a consideration of evidence, does it?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2792.85,2794.456,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.653,2815.087,Where?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2815.087,2822.743,"In Oakland, in East Oakland, California, all within the same basic geographical area."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2915.337,2918.106,You said petitioner said that who identified him.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2918.106,2929.532,"Mr. Perry, the witness to whom he was demanding the money identified him and two other witnesses, Mr. Griffith and Mr. Jones who were in the store."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2962.778,2965.332,How many people identified him?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2965.332,2973.679,"Well, Your Honor, there is again additional he then robs, the petitioner then robs the Linden Liquor Store at about 11:30."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.934,2985.733,Besides nothing that was used to --
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,2985.733,2986.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2998.369,3001.386,"Now, how many identified him there?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3001.386,3004.588,"The owner Your Honor, Mr. Polititch."
1968.670,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3007.287,3010.812,"Excuse me, is there any question about the identity then?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3010.812,3011.607,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3075.207,3079.323,How about the -- there were three robberies?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3079.323,3080.086,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3083.724,3084.808,Right.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3086.522,3091.175,And there was a total of six witnesses at the first three stores.
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3100.299,3103.994,Did anybody deny that what was then the alibi to him?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3103.994,3104.553,"No, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3120.76,3131.766,Is there any testimony from the defendant offered by the defendant from witnesses not from himself as to indicate where he was at the time these robberies occurred?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3131.766,3137.517,None whatsoever Your Honor.
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3164.952,3166.763,As having been taken from him?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3166.763,3168.18,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3211.107,3214.261,"Now, before you get to the cause."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3230.298,3231.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3262.686,3264.178,"That was the hand he had used in holding the gun, holding whatever?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3264.178,3269.55,That was the right hand that he was simulating the gun in the robberies.
1968.670,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3310.797,3323.491,"And addition to that, does the State make any arrest that the judgment of each judge that this error was harmless is entitled to any consideration here?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3323.491,3323.654,Oh!
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3373.222,3380.569,"Mr. O'Brien, is this the same judges that heard that evidence?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3380.569,3381.224,"Your Honor, I --"
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.224,3382.717,I guess I find you -- I understand.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3382.717,3388.942,"I believe that there would have been -- there may have been -- no, Your Honor, I believe they are all the same."
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3388.942,3390.223,The names are in here.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3390.252,3391.748,They would be the same Your Honor.
1968.670,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3395.85,3397.359,I see.
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3397.359,3402.805,The court was the first appellate district?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3402.805,3403.563,Second division.
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3403.92,3406.568,Second division that is what area of the state?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3406.568,3410.29,That is the basically the San Francisco Bay area.
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3410.29,3412.936,"And if this -- this trial was in San Francisco, in the city?"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3412.936,3414.639,"Alameda, Your Honor, Oakland, right across the bay."
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.639,3416.75,Across the bay.
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3422.733,3423.483,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3423.483,3426.09,And is that Division II --
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3426.09,3427.247,Of the first district --
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.247,3429.316,And does that consist of only three judges?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3429.316,3430.235,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3430.235,3431.964,"So, unless there was a change in personnel, made entirely personnel --"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3431.964,3434.811,"All -- no, there's not been a change at that time."
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3437.611,3485.392,"I suppose that there is some doubt as to whether the Court applied the correct standard from plaintiff by Chapman, the question is whether a harmless error is harmless -- is harmless error in terms of a judgment of the Court that there was conclusive evidence of guilt which is what was done here or whether the courts tasks is to determine whether beyond reasonable doubt no rational or reasonable juror could have felt that could arrived that a different conclusion absent improper comment."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3485.392,3489.431,"Your Honor, I believe that the Court of Appeals in this case applied that standard and --"
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3489.431,3490.77,Applied which standard?
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3490.77,3491.506,Pardon?
1968.670,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3491.506,3501.837,"The Court of Appeals here applied the first standard that is to say looked at the whole record and said, “From the whole record we find that there is conclusive evidence of guilt.”"
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3527.165,3540.42,"Well, then Your Honor, we then get into a question of what these courts stated in Chapman and the -- in that situation, this Court stated that it was merely a restatement of the original of Fahey standard."
1968.670,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3563.885,3586.549,"Mr. O'Brien, do you think that when this Court sends the case back for reconsideration in the light of a certain case that the Court can just say without more -- we've consider it and we adhere to our -- we adhere to our former opinion and that exactly what happen in this case."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3627.582,3637.631,"Oh, Your Honor -- Your Honor as a minute the most significant part namely they final sentence, namely as to the error and commenting instructing on defendant's failure to testify."
1968.670,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3657.565,3659.645,"No, not at all but my point is this."
1968.670,1,22916,edward_p_obrien,,3687.486,3699.069,"Your Honor, I think that the reviewing Court makes that determination and in some cases may determine to proceed in that matter."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4673.827,4677.129,"I wish to, thank you Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.670,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4677.129,4679.761,"Klitgaard, you may proceed."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4679.761,4681.755,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.670,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4768.558,4769.265,Mr. Klitgaard.
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4769.265,4769.689,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4769.689,4771.03,Would for just a moment.
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4787.683,4788.013,"Yes, sir."
1968.670,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4835.534,4842.079,"Of course in this case, we set aside a judgment twice but we're talking about the final the last time."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4842.079,4842.544,Right.
1968.670,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4842.544,4847.627,And they set aside a judgment remanded it to the Court so that it started everything doing again --
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4847.627,4848.403,"Well, the judgment --"
1968.670,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4848.403,4849.987,It doesn't -- it was vacated?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4849.987,4850.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4853.902,4856.203,So they may begin?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4856.203,4858.763,"Something had to be done to it, it had to be reentered."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4890.835,4896.149,"Well, there's nothing to grant to suggest that the manner -- the petitioner will matter --"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4896.149,4896.317,As --
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4896.317,4896.789,-- these cases.
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4896.789,4907.451,"-- as I thought, these cases here ended the matter when the California Supreme Court says, it's as long as the judgment remains the same if the opinion is modified that doesn't start the time running again."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4913.515,4913.979,"Oh, yes."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4936.114,4939.63,"Well, you must remember Mr. Justice that this time petitioner didn't have any lawyer."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4949.829,4956.828,"You mean -- you mean, when you never got a lawyer -- when you haven't got a lawyer what -- you don't need to get the judgment within to the highest Court of State."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4956.828,4957.781,I'm not saying that.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4973.567,4975.456,"You just set aside, so?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4975.456,4976.388,It was vacated.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4976.388,4979.864,"Yes, it was no longer in effect until it was reentered some time."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4979.864,4981.324,It was reaffirmed.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4981.324,4982.927,And what did we set aside?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4991.649,4994.822,You vacated your older decision -- you vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4994.822,4995.154,That's right.
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,4997.432,4998.483,"No, he didn't vacate that."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4999.7,5009.332,"How about -- thought about --you could not have gone for the first time to the Supreme Court of California I gather, until that judgment which we vacate was entered by the Court of Appeals, is that right?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5009.332,5011.876,"I'm sorry, I didn't follow your question Mr. Justice."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5011.876,5016.76,Then -- what went to the Supreme Court at the time the petitioner attempted the --
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5016.76,5017.85,"Oh, the first time out?"
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5017.85,5023.588,"Yes, that was the judgment of the Court of Appeals, wasn't it?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5023.588,5028.367,"I believe it was the judgment, if not let me answer this way because there's necessary question here in California."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5051.965,5053.826,But now it denies hearing --
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5053.826,5054.731,That ends it.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5054.731,5060.047,"And that means, if the judgment -- the final judgment -- appellate judgment in the case, is the judgment of the Court of Appeals --"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5060.047,5060.596,Correct.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5061.024,5064.388,-- and isn't that the judgment of the Court of Appeals that we vacated?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5064.388,5065.066,That's right.
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5065.066,5069.18,"And then, when the new opinion was filed what happened?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5072.962,5074.623,It's the reinstatement of the original judgment.
1968.670,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5076.812,5081.89,"But on page 342 it says, judgment affirmed."
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5081.89,5084.899,"Well, then Mr. Justice, the judgment was affirmed."
1968.670,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5098.056,5102.121,As you say this judgment could not go to the Court of -- the Supreme Court?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5102.121,5103.072,I beg your pardon.
1968.670,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5103.072,5106.727,Do you say that this judgment could not go to the Supreme Court?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5106.727,5109.796,If I were a lawyer in California advising petitioner at this time.
1968.670,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5123.06,5126.167,"Well, do you consider these factual matters?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5127.903,5130.632,The whole harmless error rule Mr. Justice is one of fact.
1968.670,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5132.069,5138.256,"It's applying a rule to the fact, right?"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5138.256,5144.135,"Yes, every case involves that."
1968.670,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5144.135,5150.115,"Mr. Klitgaard, you may take few moments to -- on the evidence if you wish to continue that --"
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5150.115,5154.184,"Well, let me just come back to Mr. Justice Marshall's point."
1968.670,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5224.805,5226.853,Is that fairly stated counsel?
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5226.853,5229.95,But while it was merely Your Honor in reply to Justice White's question.
1968.670,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5261.377,5271.87,But what is that rule of -- rule that says that the Court of Appeals cannot reverse a case unless the cases are good.
1968.670,2,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5271.87,5275.731,"Penal Code Section 1253, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.670,3,22916,edward_p_obrien,,5299.037,5302.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, just in connect with 1253."
1968.670,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5333.421,5335.571,Have you finish Mr. Klitgaard?
1968.670,4,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5335.571,5338.698,"Yes, unless the Court has some additional questions."
1968.670,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5338.698,5339.53,Very well.
1968.670,4,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5339.53,5340.46,Thank you.
1968.670,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5340.46,5354.832,"Mr. Klitgaard, I want you to know that the Court appreciates your acceptance of our assignment to represent this indigent defendant, that's a real public service and we're grateful to you for it."
1968.670,4,42926,thomas_j_klitgaard,,5354.832,5356.066,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.670,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5356.066,5362.475,"Mr. O'Brien, we appreciate too, the immediate manner in which you represent the People of State of California."
