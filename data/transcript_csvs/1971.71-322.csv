1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.122,We will hear arguments next in Bremen and Unterweser against Zapata Off-Shore Company.
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,55.167,58.703,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the court."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,228.958,236.834,"Do I understand that, that clause was subject to negotiation before he finally agreed upon, wasn't it?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,236.834,237.541,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,237.541,241.982,"Between the parties there had been some discussion, what law should apply, had they not?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,241.982,246.02,The record is devoid of indication that was discussion between the parties.
1971.71-322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.202,272.019,That clause is in the original submission?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,272.019,275.349,"Yes sir, it was in the original submission and obviously in the --"
1971.71-322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.349,283.803,I thought I read somewhere that there had been some consideration of other law besides--
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,283.803,310.219,"What you're referring to Mr. Justice Brennan is the fact that the director from Unterweser, that's the affidavit of Eric Oswegon (ph), in which he said that normally Unterweser applies German law and German forums to their contracts but here, recognizing that this tow voyage would traverse many jurisdictions and as a compromise, they selected the London forum and then submitted that to Zapata and Zapata executed the contract."
1971.71-322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.219,313.974,"In other words, that decision that was made by Unterweser?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,313.974,316.582,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,316.582,326.662,Well is it your view that the parties each having one national court to which it -- for which it would have a preference and agreed upon a neutral court?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,326.662,328.849,I believe that's what happened here.
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.204,354.813,Well did the clause say that in which law would apply?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,354.813,356.345,No Mr. Justice White.
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,360.97,364.573,So there is no attempt to specify a law?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,364.573,376.62,"No, we would contend that the attempt was to specify English law as well and that's how the clause has been interrupted by the English courts which have also had this case before."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.62,386.93,"I mean normally in English court, regardlessly of the location of an accident or of any other contacts would apply English law?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,386.93,397.408,"Apparently, the English law, on that subject, Mr. Justice White, is that where the parties had selected the forum, it is presumed that they selected it with the intent of having that forum apply its own law."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.408,401.978,Would that include the English conflict laws?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,401.978,406.744,I can't answer that question on English law.
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,424.467,437.061,"That would be the alternatives this collision, this accident occurred, this damaged occurred in waters of no particular nation, isn't that true?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,437.061,438.718,That's correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.692,464.106,Outweighed or balanced?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,464.106,465.138,Balanced.
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.962,522.384,"Was that appearance by Zapata there, a general appearance or does it make any difference?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,522.384,526.722,"Well, believe it was a special appearance."
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.388,540.81,Prior action pending where?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,540.81,551.279,"In the US and of course they were referring to their district court action in Tampa, which was filed in January and the action by Unterweser in London was filed in February."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.431,562.323,When was Unterweser's limitations actions filed?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,562.323,567.105,"I was coming to that Mr. Justice White, that comes later."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.334,568.553,Not much later though.
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,568.553,576.474,"No sir, not much later, about six months later."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.687,597.94,"They didn't have to do that, did it, to ultimately prevail on the issue that's here."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,597.94,606.065,We submit that it had to do that in order to protect its limitation right which was about to expire --
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.065,616.689,"Only, only if the forum question didn't cancel out the American action?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,616.689,630.566,"If the forum provision had been enforced by the District Court, and that had been sustained on Appeal because I presume an appeal would have been taken, then they would not have to file a limitation action in US."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.566,636.533,Why didn't they pursue that then from the time the District Court first refused to stay action?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,636.533,645.174,"Because at the time that we filed a complaint limitation, the District Court had still not on ruled on our original motion filed in the original action."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.174,647.463,Why was a limitations action filed?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,647.463,658.292,"Because the six-month statute was about to run, and if you do not file a limitation within six months of first written notice, you may lose that right."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.318,661.065,You may lose it or?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,661.065,664.082,"You may lose it there is some doubt, Mr. Justice White."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,715.619,724.324,Can you file formally petition that in anyway it was something like a special appearance without prejudice to your forum claim under the contract?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,724.324,726.511,"Mr. Justice Brennan, this is precisely what we did."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.511,727.193,I see.
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,727.193,744.348,"In the petition -- in our complaints seeking limitation, we reasserted the supremacy of the forum clause, pointing out that the court had not ruled on, that we were compelled to file limitation, but we still maintain and assert it that, that forum clause was supreme and govern the cause and the matter should be referred to London."
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,744.348,758.91,"If the parties at the outset had both acknowledged the forum clause of the contract, would you have been in the Florida Courts at all in the United States Court?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,758.91,764.707,"If Zapata had complied with this contractual obligations, there would be no lawsuit in Tampa."
1971.71-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.974,775.458,"Mr. Kerr, does English law recognize the type of admiralty limitation proceeding that the United Stated laws do."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,775.458,779.078,"They do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but it is somewhat different."
1971.71-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.146,824.12,"If as you suggest, Zapata had performed it's obligation under the contract to resort to the British forum."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,831.042,842.658,"They would have a filed a complaint, alleging in the British Courts, alleging negligent towage and alleging, I presume the same breaches of same action responsibility."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.372,848.948,"And in that circumstances and under the British law, what about the limitation action, how would that come under--?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,848.948,854.489,"Under British law as we understand it , the moment you have a court of circuit claim against you."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.661,884.356,Wasn't there a provision in this contract saying that Unterweser would not be liable in any event?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,884.356,905.001,"Mr. Justice White there are clauses in the contract on the general towage conditions which are incorporated in the contract by reference, which have been categorized by British solicitor, say affidavit this case as exculpatory and I don't think we would serve a purpose to be called about it, I think they are exculpatory."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.082,919.296,Clearly here though.
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,919.296,923.061,"And in United States, this is of course a critical issue in this case."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.061,923.948,"That's Bisso, isn't it?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,923.948,927.238,That's Bisso and Dixilyn and other decisions.
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.238,935.98,"So maybe if Zapata would never have filed that action, the English court might have been useless."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,935.98,971.011,"We say this, it's premature actually to determine that but the possibilities or the likelihood is that this exculpatory provision or these clauses which in that read altogether, provide an exculpatory provision, would be enforced by the British courts, of course, we say Mr. Justice White, that this was part of the contract, this was part of the expectation and this was part of referring a case to London, which was Zapata's contract and this is a natural, this flows naturally from the entry of the towage contract."
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.011,971.478,Are those clause --
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,971.478,972.537,Which is what they are fighting for.
1971.71-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.537,975.989,Do you know whether those clauses are enforced in German courts?
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,975.989,977.254,I happen to know that.
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1173.582,1193.29,"I gather Mr. Kerr, you are or are you satisfied that in the British forum proceeding, it's improbable that they would apply American law to Bisso on merits of this confidence?"
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,1193.29,1211.618,"I think it's improbable, Mr. Justice Brennan, and I can't give you a positive answer obviously but I think it's improbable because they have already indicated and their case law reflects, that in a situation where parties select the forum, they also intend to select the law, otherwise it will be little purposely selecting the forum, that is the law of England."
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1228.931,1235.042,"But it's either British or German law, than those exculpatory clauses would be enforced probably."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,1235.042,1236.275,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1237.072,1241.869,It's only if the Bisso rule were applied that you might not ---
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,1241.869,1290.871,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it is only if you extend Bisso rule and say that it encompasses this situation and in order to do that, you must say that it's the Bisso rule which makes this forum clause unreasonable and we submit that you get into a situation then when you got to consider, is it more unreasonable to reform this contract after the fact in favor of Zapata and thereby frustrate even Zapata's contractual intent what ended in a contract and at the same time, put Unterweser in an economic, position of economic exposure that a contract to insulate itself from, is that one unreasonable or is it more reasonable to form a contract and enforce Bisso, extend Bisso to cover this situation, I have saved the balance of my time for rebuttal Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.871,1312.12,"What you are saying, I take it, Mr. Kerr's, that it's hardly reasonable to assume that the parties would contract for British court if they intended to enforce American law, for example, in which case it would be in the hands of judges unfamiliar with it to American law."
1971.71-322,0,21067,david_cg_kerr,,1312.12,1312.464,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1357.904,1359.969,"Very well, Mr. Kerr."
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1363.525,1370.203,"Justice, may it please the court."
1971.71-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.224,1512.528,Are the conditions -- is the call for bid in the contract?
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1512.528,1513.455,Sir?
1971.71-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.455,1516.143,Is the call for bids in the record?
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1516.143,1517.143,Yes they are.
1971.71-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.249,1526.077,Was there any insurance provisions in the --
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1526.077,1528.218,"No, Zapata is uninsured."
1971.71-322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.649,1541.039,"Mr. Nance, so Zapata did through experience to review this submitted contract, it did submit some changes they denied?"
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1541.039,1548.521,"No, Your Honor, there is a (Inaudible), no attorneys reviewed this that was --"
1971.71-322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1548.521,1551.778,Or did Zapata itself review the contract and submit to it --
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1551.778,1567.029,"Well they have -– and this is not in the record, they must have the exchange of telegrams and on the draft of the -- I believe the contract that's in the record, it shows the initial of HST that's Mr. Taylor that signed the affidavit."
1971.71-322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.599,1576.899,But they did make changes in other portions of the contract submitted to the Bremen visit.
1971.71-322,1,32176,james_k_nance,,1576.899,1581.202,Yes they did and they are the ones that are initiated in the record.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3592.097,3615.988,"Mr. Chief Justice if it please the court, I have several factual points I think should be cleared up that were raised by questions from the court, but first of all in order to decide what the lower court, the District Court determined or held with respect to our motion, our original motion filed in the initial action to stay this proceeding and have it referred to London Court."
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3836.399,3838.558,"We have stipulated, have both parties agreed?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3838.558,3839.501,We have offered this.
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3839.501,3840.193,You have offered this.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3840.193,3840.546,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3842.862,3846.535,Once you say Mr. Kerr what's the status of that London proceeding?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3846.535,3850.649,The London proceeding of course Mr. Justice Brennan is stayed by injunction.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3869.921,3876.921,"Let's assume you win this case, are you going to abandon your limitations action?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3876.921,3887.984,"Abandon the limitation action in US, I suspect we will Mr. Justice White because then under English law we will be compelled as soon as Zapata makes its claims against us in the English action."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.075,3898.086,Oh I know but do you think you can force claimants to go to England?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3898.086,3899.343,So far as I know Your Honor --
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3899.343,3906.113,"Let's assume well, let's assume some other claimant came in here into this limitations action, you couldn't terminate it then could you?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3906.113,3909.92,"No sir and of course those claimants would not be bound, be bound by the forum provision either."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.92,3910.998,No that's what I said.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3910.998,3912.18,That's right.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3912.18,3920.071,And I suppose you are interested in foreclosing other claimants.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3920.071,3921.914,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3921.914,3926.18,"And if they don't come into this limitation action here in the United States, they are foreclosed, aren't they?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3926.18,3927.289,That is correct.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3928.298,3933.438,My question again to you is are you going to abandon your limitations action if you win this lawsuit?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3933.438,3941.709,"If we win this lawsuit, we would ask as we did, we have already asked in the limitation action that our action be stayed in the United States --"
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3941.709,3943.013,Stayed but not abandoned?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3943.013,3953.58,No sir and the reason for that is that we have one of the concerns here and concerns in some of the cases is what about the Zapata's security after all they brought in rem suit.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3969.163,3978.039,"Well, your claimant and limitation actions is that every claimant except Zapata should be able to litigate in that action against Unterweser."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3978.039,3980.601,"That is correct, that's the purpose of the limitation action."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3980.601,3986.962,"But you say that for one claimant, the Forum Clause precludes his filing a claim."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3986.962,3993.743,I say that the claimant that is subject to a forum provision must litigate where the contract calls for.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3997.883,4004.338,But you gave Zapata notice though I suppose and you got an injunction against their lawsuit.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4004.338,4007.838,We got a restraining order of the initial suit.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4009.789,4013.721,Well I know they may get a notice or an invitation or a direction to file their claim?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4013.721,4015.148,"And they did, yes sir."
1971.71-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4020.537,4028.178,"Mr. Kerr, I suppose there is at least a practical presumption that no other claimants have appeared on the scene since the time of the Act."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4030.835,4033.756,I think at this point that's a safe assumption Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1971.71-322,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4039.119,4042.471,We don't know whether any have been settled or anything.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4042.471,4044.669,Not to my knowledge.
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4044.669,4060.499,"Is this situation different with respect to colloquy, you have been engaging in, from what it would be if instead of a forum clause for the British Courts, you had a different type of Forum Clause."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4071.405,4084.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, evidently there would be a slight distinction as a matter of law because it appears that arbitration clauses now are generally recognized and enforced."
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4111.045,4114.014,I am not so sure if that's true.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4126.399,4131.122,I wasn't referring to the recognition as far as the results or what the review might be.
1971.71-322,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4201.909,4207.299,Could you have done the same thing Mr. Kerr by answering in the fliled suit.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4207.299,4217.932,"We suggest Mr. Justice Brennan no for two reasons; number one, we would not have had a protection of our security."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4320.44,4326.998,Do you think the Forum Clause would have prevented you from bringing the limitations action in Tampa?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4326.998,4327.53,Yes sir.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4347.688,4364.188,"Some of the claimant had arrested the ship in Tampa and sued you and brought a limitations action and you noticed all claimants including Zapata, would you do that under the limitation clause?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4364.188,4374.218,"Yes sir and I think the limitations court would say that since Zapata is compelled by contract to file its claim in London, they may file a claim in London."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4374.218,4375.424,Yeah they may but --
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4375.424,4379.847,They can or should.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4392.557,4400.854,You don't think you could make Zapata come into the limitations action if it had been filed in the circumstances I posed.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4400.854,4407.874,"No sir, because it would have been a limitation action pending in London presumably."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4407.874,4409.776,Not if Zapata hadn't sued you there?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4409.776,4420.552,"No, obviously Zapata hadn't sued us there, there would be no limitation action in London but if the contract had been complied with, all of the issues in this clause, including limitation would have been before the London High Court of Justice."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.552,4423.174,Well I'll put it this way.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4437.72,4439.324,"I think absolutely, successfully."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4441.073,4456.996,"Even though some other claimant arrests the ship filed a limitations action in response to that and then Zapata files this claim along with other claimants, you would say you could make Zapata go to London to litigate his claim."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4456.996,4459.194,"Yes sir, because we would not have filed the limitation --"
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4459.194,4461.972,I guess you have to say that in your position.
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4461.972,4468.612,"Well I feel I do because the action would, there would have been a limitation action pending in London presumably."
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4475.281,4484.313,"Mr. Kerr, I know your time is up but may I just ask you what's the difference between this $8,000 fund fund and it's mentioned what would be available here in forum."
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4484.313,4489.178,This is just a difference in the limitation funds in the two countries.
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4493.303,4497.772,"Well, is it as small as $8,000?"
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4497.772,4498.244,"Yes sir, $80,000, yes sir."
1971.71-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4498.244,4500.666,And what's the amount here?
1971.71-322,2,21067,david_cg_kerr,,4501.92,4511.607,"It's $1, 390,000 which is presently the established value of the Bremen at the present juncture of the proceedings."
1971.71-322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4511.607,4513.357,"Thank you Mr. Kerr, thank you Mr. Nance."
