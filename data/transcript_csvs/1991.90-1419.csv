1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,39.867,"We'll hear argument next in 90-1419, National Railroad Passenger Corporation, et al. v. Boston and Maine Corporation, Inc., and 90-1769, Interstate Commerce Commission and United States v. Boston and Maine Corporation, et al.--"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,65.836,68.818,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.928,100.842,Does everybody agree that the congressional amendment applies to this case?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,100.842,107.215,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was made explicitly applicable to any case pending before, during, or after enactment of the act."
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.036,269.286,"Mr. Roberts, does the ICC have to make a determination as to whether the property is required for inner-city rail passenger service?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,271.836,272.986,"We believe that it does, Your Honor."
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.185,310.221,"Does the ICC have to decide whether a less than a fee interest would meet the so-called requirement, or that what is required is less than a fee interest?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,310.221,310.852,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.852,313.173,It's a fee or nothing?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,313.173,326.323,"The ICC reads that language... required for inter-city rail passenger service... to mean simply that the property that's involved must be put to use by Amtrak in providing that service, as opposed to being used for something else."
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.161,343.487,But who decides whether an easement will suffice as opposed to taking the fee interest in the property?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,343.487,357.777,"Amtrak decides in the first instance whether it will put this property to use in providing inter-city rail passenger service, and if that is in fact what the property is to be used for, that statutory mandate is satisfied."
1991.90-1419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.062,390.17,"Is there any contention that the review that is required of the FCC was not undertaken in this case, as you define it?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.17,392.383,"As I define it, I don't believe so."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.029,479.544,"Challenge you to come up with an explanation as to how this amendment goes to the word required, which is the basis for the decision below."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,483.947,489.741,"Well, if it's a dead stand-off then the Commission under Chevron is entitled to deference in its construction."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.741,491.353,Not on the basis of the amendment.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,491.353,496.685,What the amendment said... what the court of appeals... the amendment needs to be understood in light of the court of appeals' decision.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.707,517.274,"The amendment has to be understood primarily on the basis of its language, and nothing in its language whatever goes to the word required, which was the basis for the court of appeals' decision."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,517.274,518.506,"Well, with respect, I disagree."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.712,545.566,Reconveyance is only one manner of proving that you don't need the property.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,557.484,567.622,"Well, what the court of appeals said is we can tell that Amtrak did not need the property because it reconveyed it, and the amendment at least undermines that holding of the court of appeals."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.304,581.034,"So then we'd have to remand to the court of appeals to say, you should not consider the reconveyance automatically to show that they didn't need the property, but you can still consider whether they needed the property or not."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,581.034,581.925,"--Well, then let me turn to the--"
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.925,583.337,"You don't want to waste all that time, do you?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,583.337,584.188,"--No, I--"
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.188,585.648,It will only come out the same way.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,585.648,591.811,"--I don't think a remand's necessary for that purpose, because under Chevron the decision was wrong even before the amendment."
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.221,606.954,Same way Thomas Jefferson read the necessary and proper clause.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,606.954,611.569,"--Well, and quite different from the way Chief Justice Marshall read it in McCullough against Maryland."
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.58,669.723,"What section are you reading now, Mr. Roberts?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.723,677.27,"--I'm referring to section 402(d), which is set forth in the appendix to our brief, page 1a."
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,803.027,807.14,You're talking about 402(a) and 402(b).
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.14,808.091,"--(d), I'm sorry if I--"
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.091,808.341,(d)?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,818.429,819.32,--No.
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.38,835.212,The appendix to the Government's brief?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.212,835.463,Right.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.906,896.575,"Mr. Roberts, I... of course required can be read the way the Commission wanted to, in isolation, but isn't it unreasonable to read it that way when, if you do not read it to impose a requirement of necessity in the narrow sense, the only thing Amtrak has to do in order to condemn property is to show either... either... that taking it away will not impair the ability of the railroad it's taking it from to function, or that it can't do without the property itself."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,896.575,901.9,Congress determined that Amtrak was entitled to those powers on that basis.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.123,928.229,"You really think they gave Amtrak the power to take any property from any railroad in the country, so long as taking that property didn't impair the ability of that railroad to operate."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.922,937.716,"So long as they use it, so long as they're unable to agree, and so long, of course, as the railroad receives just compensation for its property."
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.906,983.702,"Would you take the position that any instance in which the exercise of the eminent domain power, followed by a reconveyance, would in effect give Amtrak a cheaper way of using a particular line, that Amtrak therefore has met the significantly impair requirement?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.702,988.965,The significantly--
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.965,1002.813,"So that whenever... well, let's say whenever one of B&M's competitors comes along and says well, if you condemn it and give it to us, we will maintain the track for you cheaper than you would have to chip in for the B&M to maintain it for you."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.007,1011.231,"--Well, I think it may well always be sufficient under the statute."
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1035.707,1058.923,"Does that mean, then, that whenever a competitor of the condemnee would make a favorable agreement with Amtrak to maintain the line at a cheaper maintenance or operating cost that it will always be lawful under the statute for Amtrak to... or for the Commission to allow Amtrak to condemn?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1058.923,1086.211,"--Well, no, and the reason is that the reconveyance from Amtrak to the competitor also must be approved by the ICC under section 11343, and in that... on that question the Commission looks at normal competitive concerns: what is reconveyance from one rail carrier, Amtrak, to another going to do to competition in the rail market, and if the Commission refuses to approve the reconveyance the transaction cannot go forward."
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.841,1111.789,How is Boston and Maine going to benefit having its competitor on this line have an upgraded track in part with the subsidy of the Federal Government?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1111.789,1116.411,--Because Boston and Maine retains trackage rights to serve its customers on the line.
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1116.411,1117.392,It doesn't need it.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1117.392,1119.023,Pardon me?
1991.90-1419,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1119.023,1120.205,It doesn't need it.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1120.205,1129.371,"It does need... it doesn't own the track any more so it needs trackage rights to serve customers it already has on the line, and it was granted those trackage rights in this transaction."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.51,1146.072,"It's such a good deal for them, you'd think they would have entered into that deal with Amtrak."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1157.251,1157.419,No.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.041,1162.383,Are unable to agree.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.383,1163.594,--upon terms for the sale.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.855,1169.12,"Now, you think that means nothing more... what was the actual condemnation price here, $2.5 million?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1169.12,1171.073,--It's still subject to challenge.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.805,1172.596,Give or take a little--
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.596,1174.055,The Commission found $2.3 million.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.055,1177.999,"--$2.3 million, and Amtrak came in, and how much did Amtrak offer?"
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1177.999,1178.77,A million.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.77,1181.722,"Amtrak offered a million and said gee, we can't agree, you won't take a million."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.399,1195.093,"No, and what the Commission expressly found in this case was that the parties were unable to agree."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.093,1195.984,Of course.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1204.391,1206.604,"If there is, it was satisfied in this case."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.195,1208.697,Was that a finding below?
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.697,1215.302,--What the Commission found... I'm reading from page 130a of the appendix to the petition.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.532,1232.764,I'm waiting for your good-faith effort.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1232.764,1237.639,It was when I quoted the part about a valid purchase... a valid offer to purchase the line.
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.639,1238.41,"Oh, I'm sure it was a valid offer to purchase."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.876,1256.514,"In the context... as the Commission stated, in the context of the long and laborious dealings between Amtrak and Boston and Maine, the Commission found that the parties were unable to agree."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.514,1261.278,"There were long and laborious dealings about other matters, but this was the only dealing about a purchase."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1277.169,1281.493,"Well, this wasn't a... and this... that's true, and this wasn't a first step."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.909,1293.113,"Every negotiating authority doesn't have a provision like this that says, if the parties are unable to agree."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1296.075,1307.004,"The requirement can't be that the party offer a fair market price for the property objectively determined, because then there'd be no need for the condemnation authority in the first place."
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.833,1336.265,It's a rather silly requirement if that's all it means.
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1348.203,1350.686,"Well, they wanted--"
1991.90-1419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.686,1352.117,--and they thought that would be--
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.117,1354.19,--They wanted a different trackage arrangement.
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.84,1437.429,"--Now, the dissent in the court of appeals would have remanded for a determination of the extent to which the full fee was needed."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.429,1441.433,"Yes, but the... I guess it was a concurring opinion by... yes."
1991.90-1419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1453.912,1466.249,"Well, I note that it does say the Commission has to find the obligations can adequately be met by the acquisition of alternative property, including the interest in property."
1991.90-1419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1473.365,1481.893,"First of all, we only reach that question if the common carrier... the ability to discharge the common carrier obligations of the railroad are going to be impaired."
1991.90-1419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.077,1517.729,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1519.472,1523.415,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.196,1589.097,"Well, Mr. Goldbloom, is it not correct that the statute says that unless the Commission finds (a) and (b) under section 1, then the need of the corporation for the property shall be deemed to be established?"
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1589.097,1596.923,"Yes, Chief Justice, it does say that, but that is a second level of inquiry that the Commission must make."
1991.90-1419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.159,1655.604,So you say the term need of the corporation as used after subsections (a) and (b) does not include the requirement for inter-state... inter-city rail service and it doesn't suffice to dispense with the negotiation requirement?
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1655.604,1659.928,"Yes, Chief Justice, that is our answer, and let me amplify, if I may, on that."
1991.90-1419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.399,1754.723,I don't think you're disagreeing with the Government on that point.
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1770.805,1775.349,I don't believe it goes as far as the word essential.
1991.90-1419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.823,1843.868,"Let me just interrupt, because I think I'm following but I want to be sure I'm right."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1855.555,1860.72,"No, we're not arguing... Justice Stevens, we're not arguing that they did not require the use of this trackage."
1991.90-1419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.72,1860.96,I see.
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1862.091,1863.113,They didn't need the fee.
1991.90-1419,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1886.04,1889.172,Won't it always require less than a fee when it's trackage rights?
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1898.328,1900.601,"No, Justice Souter."
1991.90-1419,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1906.856,1908.967,"Well, I'm assuming that they're taking it from another railroad."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1908.967,1910.477,--It may be property.
1991.90-1419,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1913.72,1920.495,"When, for the... can you give me an example of a case in which they would need to take the fee in trackage rights?"
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,1920.495,1965.194,"I cannot... there is a suggestion in the concurring opinion by Judge Ginsburg in the court below that in a circumstance where Amtrak was dealing with another railroad and where, under the facts in that particular hypothetical, Amtrak was unable to get the type of trackage rights interest or the cooperation of the other railroad in running its trains over those tracks, in those circumstances, Judge Ginsburg suggests that perhaps 402(a) could be used to obtain trackage rights."
1991.90-1419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.993,2037.105,"Well, Mr. Goldbloom, I thought the problem here was that the Amtrak could get a trackage right but it needed a trackage right over a rail line that was maintained adequately to enable it to run its passenger trains at the appropriate speed, and that what it would get here with a trackage right was simply a right to run its railroads over very poorly maintained rails at speeds that wouldn't meet its need."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2057.929,2068.556,"Well, Justice O'Connor, under 402(a) the Commission can impose conditions upon the railroad in providing the trackage rights."
1991.90-1419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.523,2115.337,"Well, in an order under (a) it would be... the Commission would have to order Amtrak to pay the costs."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2115.337,2117.44,--That's because the statute requires that.
1991.90-1419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.44,2126.097,"Amtrak doesn't have the money and has found a mechanism whereby it can get a third party to provide that cost, apparently."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2126.097,2151.693,"By brokering its condemnation authority to a third railroad, and in so doing it has gotten around the provisions of 402(a) which expresses the congressional policy to prevent cross-subsidization, to require that Amtrak bear the incremental costs of the rail passenger services."
1991.90-1419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.693,2156.927,"Mr. Goldbloom, it occurs to me... I'm not sure you're making Thomas Jefferson's argument."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2209.226,2223.818,"Well, I do place stress on it, because I believe the reference to including interests in property is a congressional recognition that something less than the fee might be called for when Amtrak seeks to condemn--"
1991.90-1419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.818,2236.096,"So the required modifies the interest in property, and the interest in property has to be used by the corporation... not necessary to the corporation, but used, and you're saying it's not being used here, the fee."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2236.096,2261.584,"--It's not being used because, as the court of appeals found and as there is no dispute in this case, Amtrak did not want to own the property, did not need to own the property, and had no interest in owning it, ever, and so if it was capable of being satisfied by an interest in property less than the fee, then the fee by definition could not be required."
1991.90-1419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.584,2268.888,"Yes, but that... you're making two different arguments, one, you're arguing they should have proceeded under 402(a) to require trackage rights."
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2274.274,2289.132,"What I'm saying, Justice Stevens, is that when the Commission is confronted with an application under 402(d) it should examine to see what it is that Amtrak is required... Amtrak requires."
1991.90-1419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.213,2338.486,Do you think you could logically make the same argument in the face of the statute as now amended?
1991.90-1419,1,28555,irwin_goldbloom,,2338.486,2340.287,"Yes, Justice Stevens--"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3264.086,3282.849,"On the unable-to-agree point, petition appendix 131a, the Commission went further and said nothing in this record provides any indication that Amtrak and B&M will ever reach agreement on terms of a sale, and I think that's because they were proceeding in different directions."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.622,3291.667,Is that part of your case that Amtrak needed the fee?
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3291.667,3298.92,Amtrak met the statutory requirement of need because its need was presumed.
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3298.92,3300.522,That hardly answers my question.
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3300.522,3302.152,"Yes, Amtrak did need the fee."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.674,3311.619,"Because Boston... they could not get out of just a trackage rights arrangement with Boston and Maine, what they had to have; is that right?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3311.619,3321.927,--Even under a very strict reading of the required phrase they needed the fee because they needed to have it to reconvey it to a railroad that had an incentive to maintain the track at their speed conditions.
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.579,3329.911,"Well, now, who... the Commission never made that finding--"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.911,3330.602,"--Well, there--"
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.602,3331.193,--Did it?
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3331.193,3334.036,"--It did make a need finding, yes."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.036,3337.509,"Well, did it make the kind of a finding I just described?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.509,3340.981,It said that Amtrak had carried its burden of establishing its need.
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.981,3349.667,"Well, did it... did they say they needed it in order to convey to somebody that was more reliable than Boston and Maine?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3349.667,3355.233,"That was the transaction that was before the Commission, and that was the context in which the Commission made that finding."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.233,3357.363,"Well, I guess I'll just have to read the... look at the--"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.363,3358.365,The Commission--
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.365,3359.995,"--They didn't say that, did they?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3359.995,3362.559,--The Commission did not make the findings about Boston and--
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.559,3365.39,"Well, that's what... the court of appeals didn't think it made that finding."
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.39,3367.912,"--It did not, and our position is that it doesn't have to."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.363,3372.053,And Judge Ginsburg didn't make that finding.
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.053,3372.564,--She would have sent back for further--
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.564,3373.666,"You don't disagree with that, do you?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.666,3379.079,--I don't disagree that they made no findings adopting Amtrak's version of events.
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.229,3400.023,"Well, need... you could say, well, maybe they found need but they didn't give an adequate explanation of it."
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.023,3408.81,"--The statute says that need is presumed unless the Commission makes contrary findings, and the Commission rejected each of the two contrary findings in the statute."
1991.90-1419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3408.81,3414.274,So you are identifying what is required with presumed need.
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.475,3426.822,"No, I think it's a two-tier analysis, but required simply means it's going to be useful and appropriate and put to use in providing intercity rail passenger service."
1991.90-1419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3426.822,3438.309,And you would satisfy that level of analysis at this point simply because the ultimate expense to Amtrak of maintaining the track would be less under this arrangement.
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.521,3441.003,"Well, we don't have to go that far."
1991.90-1419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3448.78,3448.93,All right.
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3467.883,3475.93,"That may well be, but I'll reiterate what I said earlier, that there's nothing in section 402(d) or (a) that imposes such an exhaustion requirement."
1991.90-1419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.93,3484.756,"Well, but if the question is need, why did Amtrak need the fee when in the long run it gave it back to somebody?"
1991.90-1419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3484.756,3489.098,It needed the fee in part to be able to convey it to a railroad that would maintain the line.
