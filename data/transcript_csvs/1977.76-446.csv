1977.76-446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.768,"We will hear argument next in 76-446, Procunier against Navarette."
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,50.519,53.181,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,180.955,182.198,Where do we find that in the appendix?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,182.198,185.642,You find that in the record at page 17.
1977.76-446,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.366,203.511,May I ask you question about that particular point?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,203.511,203.981,Yes.
1977.76-446,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.981,212.338,"Does it really matter as I understand your general submission, it is an allegation of negligence is insufficient under 1983?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,216.728,217.029,I am not saying --
1977.76-446,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.029,221.376,"In other words, if it were denial of access to the Courts, perhaps negligence would be enough?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,221.376,223.696,"Justice Stevens, I am not suggesting that at all."
1977.76-446,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,236.228,240.772,But your basic position is that even if it were before us your argument would be precisely the same?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,240.772,242.274,That is correct.
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.274,261.937,"Well, counsel is -- are we focusing here on some sort of a gloss that is added to the burden of proof of a plaintiff because action is bought under 1983 or should we focus on the definition of the constitutional right itself?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,273.517,287.936,"No, California has a procedure for suing public officials who act negligently and so -- in Tort law and it would not be constitutional cause of action at all."
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.936,293.875,"Well, but could not you assert a Fourteenth Amendment claim in the Superior Court of whatever county, Soledad is located?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,293.875,307.878,"As a matter of fact Your Honor, the California Supreme Court has held in the last two years that they have concurrent jurisdiction under Section 1983 and would entertain, and the State Courts may entertain 1983 causes of action in the State Courts?"
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.878,314.923,But there is a take 1983 to enable a Superior Court to entertain a constitutional cause of action?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,314.923,316.166,Probably not.
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.715,330.33,What so you conceive to be the constitutional right that the respondents assert here?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,330.33,336.418,"The respondent assert an inmate's right, a free expression in the mail."
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.552,395.201,"What if we were to decide in this case that the point reserved in Justice Powell's opinion in Procunier v. Martinez should be resolved in favor of the respondent, that is that there is a right of inmates to communicate by letter?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,405.404,406.949,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1977.76-446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.949,409.817,And yet that does not turn on anything to do with 1983?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,413.345,422.721,"Well, my understanding of 1983 is that you do not state a cause of action under 1983, unless you can first find the constitutional deprivation."
1977.76-446,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,422.721,426.099,What happened if the truck went off road every day?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,426.099,426.155,Your Honor.
1977.76-446,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.155,428.033,Accidentally?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,428.033,431.098,I think that if the truck went off the road every day --
1977.76-446,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,431.098,431.993,Accidentally?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,431.993,455.592,"Accidentally, that a cause of action could be stated under Your Honor's formulation in Estelle v. Gamble that that might constitute sufficient evidence to support a claim of deliberating difference and respondents here have two claims of intentional Tort of deliberate refusal, a deliberate indifference under which he may attempt to assert that what happened to him --"
1977.76-446,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,455.592,461.848,How many times his mail negligently not delivered?
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,461.848,470.244,The Allegation in this compliant is that 13 items of mail over a period of one-and-half years were not delivered.
1977.76-446,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,537.32,540.787,"But that submits, for the purpose of this case that is submitted?"
1977.76-446,0,42107,sanford_svetcov,,540.787,544.555,That thirteen pieces were lost.
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1657.867,1659.995,Yes.
1977.76-446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.981,1730.869,With the record that you are not pre mature in the sense that the Ninth Circuit help that there was a constitutional violation under some circumstances for failure to allow a prisoner send mail out of the prison and that 1983 authorized the statement of a claim for the violation of that right negligently?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1730.869,1759.985,"Well, the Ninth Circuit in reaching that determination was applying existing law that many other Circuits, indeed almost all of the other Circuits had already reached the similar decisions with respect to and was not purporting to or did not carry, if you will, the burden on its shoulders that I would believe that this Court does."
1977.76-446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.942,1809.091,And a deliberate conduct counselor?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1809.091,1810.756,I am sorry Your Honor.
1977.76-446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.756,1815.636,In so far as the conduct may have been deliberate that is covered by your first two causes of action --
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1815.636,1816.073,Exactly.
1977.76-446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1816.073,1817.475,-- which are not a issue here?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1817.475,1826.003,"That is correct Your Honor, but if we then, I just want to point out --"
1977.76-446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1826.003,1838.208,"In the presence posture of the case there is no question however this court decides this case that here you got to remand for a trail on your first two causes of action that is clear, is not it?"
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1838.208,1873.187,"Yes Your Honor that is clear and in a way that stands as an argument at least from the standpoint of judicial economy for making the remand now and watching the case and allowing and considering to bringing of it back, once the trail has been had and a sufficient record developed so that a more decisive and clear, a more effectively -- effective standard would be more meaningful and provide more guidance to the other Circuits could then be divined."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.187,1882.251,Mr. Adams do you think that we realize that when we voted to take this case?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1888.283,1889.191,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.2,1895.659,It saves judicial time?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,1895.659,1920.893,"If it is the worse then if the Court to reach the determination at this point in respect of negligence, let me say that there are two basic reasons that it seems to me that the negligence should be allowed as a cause of action in respect of the First Amendment and they go to the purposes of that Amendment, the purposes that Congress had in mind, those purposes being as I understand them, deterrence and compensation."
1977.76-446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.458,2074.545,Are you talking about the contours of the First Amendment right or about some limitations that 1983 puts on the on the First Amendment right?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2074.545,2085.431,"l am talking about limitations that 1983 would put on litigations under any constitutional guarantee, including the First Amendment."
1977.76-446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.73,2113.271,"You think that if you and brought an action in the Superior Court of California under the constitution, assuming you could do that where you were not limited by whatever limitations 1983 may impose, that there be no question that you could recover safer negligent failure to get the mail out of the prisoners as a result of a truck accident?"
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2113.271,2184.291,"If we assume in your hypothetical Your Honor, that common law immunities and limitations to those common law immunities as established for example in California, govern, yes I would have no problem with immunity because in dealing with negligence at least in the form of failure to act, inadvertent failure to act, we are not talking about the exercise of discretion and California has made perfectly clear the in case that I have cited in by brief Johnson v. State that even where discretion ought to be exercised, but in the actual fact of the instance it caused an injury, it was not, then the immunity, that ordinarily would enclose that particular official or the governmental entity that he represents is not available and that official stands fully exposed in negligence liability as though act were ministerial from the outset."
1977.76-446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.291,2211.5,"Well, what if you have a situation where the city has a park with an amplifier system that it makes available to all sorts of different political groups and you represent a group that has had the park made available to it and the amplifier system breaks down due to failure of proper maintenance on the part of the city, is that a violation of your group's First Amendment rights?"
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2211.5,2214.205,"Okay, I would say not Your Honor."
1977.76-446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.205,2220.181,Why is that different from a mail truck running off the road?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2220.181,2222.599,"Well, let me answer that in two ways."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.433,2339.808,Is there any carelessness under 1983 at all?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2339.808,2346.955,"Well, indeed I would believe that there is Your Honor as I sought to contend."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.955,2353.103,Well certainly 1983 was Ku Klux Clan Act and they were not killed?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2353.103,2369.008,"Certainly not, but the governmental official to fail to track down and bring the Ku Klux Clanners to justice many times were and this is something that was squarely in the minds of the Congress, the members of Congress who were debating that and I quoted in by brief Your Honor --"
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.008,2370.478,Yeah I read that.
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2370.478,2371.805,Certain places where --
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.805,2375.714,There is quite a lot in the other side too?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2375.714,2378.007,"Well, I do not mean to take up the Court's time with quotes."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.979,2384.222,Well why would --
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2384.222,2388.793,It is rather ambiguous quotes can be raised from both sides and I think we need to look at current position to decide --
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.793,2391.18,What do you do about the mail truck questions?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2397.413,2400.659,"Well, it depends whether that person has a constitutional right --"
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.659,2409.968,"It was a careless driving that is the 14th time he did it, [Laughter], does that valid 1983?"
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2409.968,2418.911,"I think probably not Your Honor, The distinction I want to make in answer to your hypothetical is that if there is no constitutional right involved, it is a matter for the State Courts."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.911,2420.993,It is just near to that.
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2429.253,2441.778,"Well, if those 13 times were in, were each time directed at picketers, let us say who are exercising their First Amendment rights along the sidewalk, yes, there we have a course of conduct and even if --"
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.778,2446.504,By the mail truck driver?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2446.504,2456.111,"If he is using a government instrumentality to interfere with First Amendment rights I think we got 1983 cause of action, but if they were simply pedestrians or people that he did not like --"
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.111,2461.548,And all he did was he ran through a red light?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2461.548,2467.105,"Well, I would adhere to the distinction of a nice worded instance versus a course of conduct."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.105,2468.36,What my real problem --
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2468.36,2471.227,Although that really seems to his intentionality in your hypothetical.
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.227,2482.392,And what you say you want to prove that these people deliberately denied them the rights because they did not understand the regulations.
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2489.791,2491.84,Why did not I say in the complaint?
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.84,2500.197,Or why did you say that you are only talking about negligence?
1977.76-446,1,35390,michael_e_adams,,2500.197,2517.072,"Because from the two items of mail where there are any facts at all in regard to what happened, it would appear that what occurred was just a blatantly negligent misreading of the applications."
1977.76-446,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.488,2539.121,Is that in this record?
1977.76-446,2,42107,sanford_svetcov,,3525.36,3528.592,Thank you Your Honor.
1977.76-446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3541.791,3542.53,Where are you reading from?
1977.76-446,2,42107,sanford_svetcov,,3542.53,3557.352,"I am reading from the appendix to the petition for certiorari at page 7, and then on page 8 it goes on to say the allegations that state officers negligently deprived him of those rights referring to the First Amendment Rights, states a 1083 cause of action."
1977.76-446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3746.381,3747.054,Thank you gentlemen.
