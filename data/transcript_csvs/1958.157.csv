1958.157,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,39.867,"No. 157, Mark Dave Martin successor to Luis M. Steven, the Secretary of Highways of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, et al Appellants versus JK Creasy et al."
1958.157,0,15424,anne_x_alpern,,42.512,52.911,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2612.728,2617.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2652.645,2655.828,But you have the law – isn't the final word?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2655.828,2672.467,"That's correct Your Honor but looking at the history of the cases in Pennsylvania, the District Court here accepted as the likelihood that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania would decide that access would not be compensable."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2672.467,2674.172,"That's a vested property, isn't it?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2674.172,2674.945,That's correct Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2674.945,2682.137,"And it's vested property, what we would do in case the Supreme Court – goes wrong according to your view of your constitutional right?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2682.137,2699.005,That's right Your Honor but there is always been the remedy of equity in a situation where a limited domain statue does not give a clear and a certain root to compensation for the property owner who was damaged.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2699.005,2703.603,Could a Pennsylvania Court of Equity give you the relief that's given here?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2703.603,2704.532,"Yes, I could have Your Honor."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2708.099,2708.992,Did you get it?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2708.992,2709.527,"No, we didn't."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2711.727,2714.26,"It was brought from – where did you receive it, in Common Pleas?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2714.26,2717.83,"We begin this case in the District Court Your Honor, before the three-judge special court."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2717.83,2731.817,"Now could you -- if you had sought relief in the Pennsylvania Court, is there equitable relief for an irreparable damage such as you claim in the federal -- in the state chancery court?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2731.817,2732.989,We believe there is Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2732.989,2734.756,And did you seek that path?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2734.756,2735.559,"Yes, we did."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2735.559,2736.659,And it was denied?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2736.659,2737.121,It was denied.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2741.418,2744.017,What happened -- what happened to that?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2744.017,2757.117,"That case went before the Commonwealth Court, the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin Country which is the state capital, which is the only court before which a suit against a state official could be brought."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2804.849,2809.368,"May I proceed with your Dauphin Country proceeding, did you brought it to the Supreme Court?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2809.368,2814.393,"We went to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, they affirmed without opinion, per curiam."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2814.393,2816.007,Did you come -- tried to come here?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2816.007,2817.079,"No, we did not Your Honor."
1958.157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2857.313,2858.394,We don't have that.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2858.394,2862.489,"No, you don't Your Honor, I have to read this to you."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2891.572,2897.766,"May I ask you, I am sorry to be pressing you, but I had to go step by step in deciding in this matter."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2912.353,2913.499,That is right.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2913.499,2920.645,"And you sought vindication of that right in a local Pennsylvania court, it denied it."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2924.673,2925.496,Affirmed per curiam.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2925.496,2927.054,They affirmed per curiam.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2943.846,2945.045,It would have been Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2950.171,2961.407,The original case ends up by tying the hands of the Commonwealth so that they can't even give you the money you want because they are enjoined from building – from cutting of access to the road?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2961.407,2962.48,We have not sought Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2969.277,2973.059,"It doesn't say so, the decree."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2973.059,2976.725,Well the decree does enjoin the enforcement of the act.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2977.307,2980.984,"Does that in their words, I can read English."
1958.157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2987.249,2993.761,(Inaudible) or otherwise defined in the Act so it interfered with it and deprived the plaintiff his right of ingress and egress?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,2993.761,3007.322,"If this Court were to remold – wanted the district court to remold that decision, that decree so as to insert the words without compensation the plaintiffs will certainly not object."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3033.902,3044.938,That was done by a District Court of United States without a prior determination on the merits that in fact you couldn't get adequate compensation.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3044.938,3045.11,Only --
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3045.11,3059.609,"I don't care how often or how persuasive either the present Attorney General or the predecessor was is saying you have no money claim, they are not to be depository of the judicial power."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3059.609,3075.062,"But the road by which we could have sought our relief that, as been suggested by the defendants and maintained all along, does result in irreparable damages and there seems to be no way around that."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3128.928,3140.109,"The temporary loss merely, I want to be clear, the temporary loss merely because the state had announced to the Secretary of Highways and the Governor that it wanted to cut all taxes?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3140.109,3141.469,"No, Your Honor, we could not go into that."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3141.469,3154.516,Since you got the relief if not from your state courts then through this Court if we thought that was a serious enough question so that the matter should be held until compensability was decided?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3154.516,3164.924,Your Honor we could not have proceeded in the state courts further or to this Court without following the route that the Attorney General has suggested.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3164.924,3167.411,Not at all if I understand you claim.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3177.349,3178.232,That's correct sir.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3178.232,3189.039,Well if that's so then this Court would have felt you did have a compensable property interest that Pennsylvania cannot take it away from you through its procedural difficulties?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3189.039,3205.333,We had the choice after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had given this summary refusal to review the question of returning to the Federal District Court where case was being held or proceeding to petition this Court by certiorari.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3205.333,3225.771,"May I interrupt you, but the district court certainly would have power to do – (Inaudible) that power to do what it did, it could have had power to suspend action on the declared purpose to cut off access until your legal claim was affirmed by appropriate court, couldn't it?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3225.771,3228.213,"Yes, it could have on theory Your Honor, we feel that it did."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3228.213,3230.828,Or did much more than that?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3230.828,3234.146,We could have proceeded to this Court at that time by petition.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3255.341,3258.844,(Inaudible) because the facts weren't before it?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3258.844,3263.27,But Your Honor the court has not always taken that position even -- that is the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3346.836,3357.582,"But you refuse (Inaudible) comfort zone, decision of this Court, after flying, low flying planes if they frighten chicken, that's a compensable interest?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3357.582,3358.196,That's right Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3358.196,3360.536,I think that would have given you good deal of comfort.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3360.536,3379.991,But you see if we had yielded and gone back to the board Bf Viewer and to get back to where I was before if the state had eventually upon being told they must pay compensation for this loss of access and as all parties agree the sum involved could be at least a million dollars.
1958.157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.868,3433.897,(Inaudible)
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3433.897,3440.852,That is the question that the Attorney General concedes is unsettled and amorphous in Pennsylvania Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3508.343,3510.156,"May I ask you, why won't that (Inaudible)?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3552.142,3552.648,Because --
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3552.648,3554.21,What would bar you from doing that?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3554.21,3558.774,We have cases in Pennsylvania and that have said --
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3558.774,3575.38,"I am talking about it is all right though if the constitution authorizes you to recover so the value of the denial of access which is finally what you are saying it should do, we should hold there."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3588.928,3591.781,If we could be assured that this Court would eventually be --
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3591.781,3607.19,"Suppose you are not assured then if you're not assured what you are saying is that you want the whole Pennsylvania up on the ground that the rule, the constitutional rule for allowing compensation is not enough."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3607.19,3615.186,We are saying that this statute has to be reformed in such a way has to guarantee that our right to access which is a constitutional right is guaranteed.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3615.186,3636.091,"I think that it -- I think it -- I don't think it is enough of what you proceed under the statute maybe I'm wrong, you will be entitled in the end to receive every dime of compensation for denial of access if the constitution as - construed gives it to you."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3642.928,3654.069,"Because the right itself is a right which we feel, which we believe has been defined in this Court as a right which the state cannot deny us under our right in the federal constitution."
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3654.069,3682.778,"Well, I'm assuming if they never could, they can't deny – let's assume they can't deny it, if they have got to pay you for the denial of access, now what do you lose if– if you'd be -- you still got to prove it sometime what the value is and you would be entitled to prove of the value of the denial of access from the day your denial was -- the denial was entered and affected from then on."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3682.778,3696.761,"We would have to do that Your Honor, we have to start it again, the long hard road through the state courts and even with the state -- with the assurance of this Court that our right to compensation was a clear constitution one."
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3702.175,3704.349,"Well, that's the way all others have to do it, isn't it?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3704.349,3744.594,"That's correct, sir, but then we would be faced with this question of the State Law of the open question of how much we have lost whether in fact this -- and this easement could be equated with a lost of land and we fear that the very expense and time involved in trashing out which -- what might become a matter to come up before this Court not once but two or three times before the state, the first, the state condemning authorities and the state courts would be completely controlled and convinced of the fact that we were entitled to be paid."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3744.594,3775.467,"But it doesn't address -- but it -- you are right is not dependent upon persuading them of your -- of the correctness of your view of the law, because either it is compensable in dollars and cents when you finally win, or if during that period you would be disadvantaged to the active operation of the law, the operation of the law could be enjoined until it puts on (Inaudible) doubt as to what your rights are."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3791.843,3794.481,"Well that, as we see it is what has been done Your Honor."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3797.274,3823.734,"But what if you have certain injunction by having a District Court tie the hand of a state and saying the ordinary process of State Law for ascertaining the value of your alleged easement and by alleged I mean, not just determined, I don't mean to question you, the value of your alleged easement can't be ascertained to the normal of channel of eminent domain of the state."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3823.734,3832.411,"Yes, Your Honor, but there are other defects to the statute of which in themselves and aside from the question of due process of the compensability of --"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3832.411,3837.608,But that's the only basis on which (Inaudible) consideration.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3840.582,3841.272,"Yes sir, but on --"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3841.272,3846.802,Didn't enforce state law because very basis was that the state law is inadequate.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3849.68,3852.471,Not only under the due process clause but under the equal protection of the law.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3852.471,3860.619,"Alright whatever it is, but if the U.S. constitution was at stake in the decision the law, not Pennsylvania law, is that right?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3860.619,3861.152,Yes.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3861.152,3867.054,The District Court moved in because it thought the state law was not doing you justice.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3868.315,3869.523,That's correct.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3869.523,3892.82,"Would you be good enough to give us references to what you deem to be controlling Pennsylvania decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on the basis of which you can say that it wasn't prophesy as to whether Pennsylvania Supreme Court would or wouldn't protect you, that it is so clear there is no doubt that Pennsylvania said your easement is no compensable interest."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3892.82,3893.99,"Yes, sir."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3893.99,3896.02,And settle this question.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3896.02,3903.582,"On page 16 of our brief, we cite Brewer versus Commonwealth."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3903.582,3904.196,Page 16?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3904.196,3906.385,16 of our brief.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3906.385,3908.437,Of your final brief.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3908.437,3929.327,"In Brewer versus Commonwealth the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said, “It is of course not open to dispute that before the Commonwealth can be made to answer in the present state of the statute of law for damages in cases of highway improvement, there must have been taking of the complaining property owners' land.”"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3929.327,3940.338,You mean that -- I am to read that – that's the pronouncement by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that only physical taking of physical as.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3940.338,3941.151,Precisely Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3941.151,3945.052,I would have to look up and find out what the facts in that case were.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3945.052,3946.952,"Well, this case as in several others the one cited --"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3946.952,3949.257,"I suppose, what was the controversy about?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3949.257,3966.328,"It was a change of grade case if I remember correctly Your Honor, in which through a change of highway of an engineering development, the physical access of the abutting property owner was -- that was destroyed or cut off."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3994.354,3997.819,But Pennsylvania is unique in having the such a holding?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,3997.819,4027.474,"Oh no, Your Honor, but other -- but in most other states since the development of an non-access highway concept in a compendium that the Court will find cited in our brief in 43 AOR 2nd, the authorities are -- or a marshal they are very clearly and show that most states as the question has come up have now conceded that access is a compensable right."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4027.474,4033.96,Has this Court have said that affirmatively that it is or it isn't as an abstract proposition?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4033.96,4049.261,"It has, Your Honor, in some early cases, the case of Donovan versus the Pennsylvania Company cited in our brief which has said, “An earlier edition of (Inaudible) on this corporations to the effect that access is a compensable right.”"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4049.261,4050.054,Is or isn't?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4050.054,4050.994,It is.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4050.994,4054.87,"Well then, you are protected by the decision of this Court?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4054.87,4070.045,"But the case is not a clear one because of some earlier cases of this Court which the Attorney General has cited of Sauer versus New York, which was involved within this question of a viaduct built in the City of New York."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4085.256,4086.841,But I happen to know that.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4093.848,4096.26,And was later reversed and affected in any event.

1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4097.265,4098.544,In Halo officially.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4098.544,4101.962,But that rested on special New York legislation.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4101.962,4102.218,But it --
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4102.218,4119.502,"But your own statement indicates that it's the best doubtful what effect (Inaudible) was right or wrong and say -- it claims that doubtful but I got to (Inaudible) and the District Court said no in the question on processing, we are not going to decide it absolutely."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4120.167,4120.584,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4120.584,4123.182,I don't think they are wrong on their constitutional law.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4126.622,4142.067,What we feel that District Court did was act as any court as a court of equity is entitled to do when an eminent domain statute is about to be enforced and the right of the property owner to be compensated is not clear an injunction is indicated.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4301.409,4302.656,May I ask you this?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4336.271,4339.53,"We doubt it, that our rights are clear in that situation."
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4339.53,4363.019,"Well, you doubt that you have a right under this -- into this act to bring suit and after the reviewer's act you can get a trial before jury and get this Court to charge that they must give the full constitutional compensation with interest from the time you were denied access to your property?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4363.019,4371.744,If the Commonwealth goes ahead with the condemnation after such a statement then we would -- then we would get -- probably we would get compensated.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4371.744,4373.604,"Well, I am not talking about after such statement."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4392.351,4392.69,"Yes, we do."
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4392.69,4394.609,Do you have any doubt about you having the right to sue?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4394.609,4401.412,"Yes, there is because in Pennsylvania the right to the Commonwealth must be established by statute and --"
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4401.412,4408.575,"Well, it doesn't have to be established by statute if the statute violates the Constitution of United States."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4408.575,4408.863,Well then there is --
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4408.863,4423.454,"You do have a right, do you not, to recover whatever the constitutional -- the constitution allows you to get for taking your property or if you want to call it taking, denying your access?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4423.454,4425.795,Not from the Commonwealth itself.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4425.795,4428.957,Is there anything it clogs you?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4436.631,4440.978,"Yes, Your Honor, there is the long standing law in Pennsylvania."
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4440.978,4442.188,That's Pennsylvania.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4454.871,4467.824,I would not want to say Your Honor that this Court could direct the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or its agents acting for the Commonwealth to submit to suit.
1958.157,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4469.178,4470.652,But notice --
1958.157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4470.652,4487.914,"By change of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court were to say that this was not a taking within this statute and this Court were to say, “Well, that construction is unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.”"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4501.64,4503.431,I'm saying it is questionable Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4507.363,4516.492,But in all events this Court could enjoin officials of Pennsylvania from carrying out a statute which we deem to be unconstitutional unless they pay you first?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4516.492,4517.678,"That's correct, Your Honor, and if the question --"
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4517.678,4523.794,"As you actually -- I notice you sued Governor of Pennsylvania, how did you get leave to sue him?"
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4529.522,4551.489,"If this Court does so order here now, then the plaintiffs will certainly be content, if this Court orders the lower court that to remold this decree or if this Court enters a decree that the defendants may not proceed to convert this road to a non access highway without payment of compensation for the loss of access."
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4551.489,4557.675,You ask us to do that after your lawsuit in the State Court of Pennsylvania.
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4557.675,4588.527,"Well, Your Honor, at the point that come up here possibly on a petition for certiorari but this way we were confident that if we lost in this -- in the District Court we have the right of appeal that was that -- it was a question of how to get before Your Honors at the time and we chose the route via the District Court, the way that it is provided, I mean first going to District Court following the provision that Congress is set up for us to allow a three-judge court to enjoin the enforcement of a non-constitutional state law."
1958.157,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4588.527,4596.704,How did you pass it that up here (Inaudible)
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4596.704,4597.295,That's correct.
1958.157,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4597.295,4600.59,(Inaudible)
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4600.59,4601.908,That's right Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4612.595,4613.996,Isn't that right?
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4633.853,4640.737,Oh there Your Honor it's a question of -- of how to come before this Court and we chose one route.
1958.157,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4648.621,4652.31,"My difficultly is not with your Mr. Good, but with the court below."
1958.157,1,22362,edward_p_good,,4652.31,4655.868,I understand that Your Honor.
1958.157,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4884.851,4887.133,"Attorney General, do you have something?"
1958.157,2,15424,anne_x_alpern,,4887.133,4905.919,"I think in fairness, we should point out that on the question of the matter of going before Board of Viewer which was asked by several of the justices, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has already stated in this particular case that the parties have a right to go before the Board of Viewer and then have their constitutional rights determined."
1958.157,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4971.933,4974.811,We'll recess now.
