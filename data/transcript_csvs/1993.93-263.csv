1993.93-263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.905,"We'll hear argument next in 93-263, Matt."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,48.573,64.914,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.335,98.045,You say the action wasn't incorporated.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,99.427,99.748,--Yeah.
1993.93-263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.097,102.51,And it was not a written agreement?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,102.51,103.18,--That's correct.
1993.93-263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.061,182.143,Was it dictated into the record some way?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,182.143,191.997,"It was summarized by one of the counsel in chambers in front of the district court judge, who had taken, as many judges do, an active role in encouraging the settlement."
1993.93-263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.774,246.594,"Well, do you argue that application of the Federal rules themselves means if you just follow the rules, that there is no right to come in later for enforcement?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,246.594,251.177,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.726,266.958,But that wasn't resorted to here.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,266.958,267.939,--It was not resorted to here.
1993.93-263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.939,276.564,"So do you take the position that if you just follow the rules, the court had no authority to enforce this judgment?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,276.564,278.766,Yes.
1993.93-263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.766,280.506,But on your--
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,284.729,296.146,The only... the constitutional question arises from the district court deciding to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to enforce this settlement.
1993.93-263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.146,301.019,"Well, but we can solve it by just saying the rules don't allow it."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,301.019,303.182,That's correct.
1993.93-263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.182,308.465,"Well, rules, strictly speaking, I suppose, can't confer jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,323.264,324.975,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,324.975,335.803,But are you not also saying that there is no juris... there would be no jurisdictional problem if a Rule 60 motion had been filed here and the other side had been... had asked to be relieved from the burden of the judgment?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,335.803,348.419,"If either party contesting the terms had made a motion that was granted, under the standards of Rule 60 the dismissal could have been vacated and the case could have been restored to the docket."
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,348.419,358.667,"All right, now if the case had been restored to the docket, would you then take the position that the court could not consider your settlement and that the only thing the court could do would be to litigate the case?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,358.667,359.669,Yes.
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.669,368.245,And that being on a jurisdictional basis or on the text of the rules?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,368.245,374.339,"Both on the text of the rules, but also on a practical basis."
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.262,412.413,"Well, would it be available here?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,412.413,420.959,"--I don't believe so under the facts, even, that the district court found of the breach, of the alleged breach of the settlement agreement."
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.941,424.902,What more would you have needed?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,429.764,443.642,"--Certainly, I think there could be cases where either there was a clear fraud in the procurement of the settlement, or perhaps a changed circumstance."
1993.93-263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,448.755,453.269,But mere breach of settlement would never be sufficient under Rule 60?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,453.269,461.374,"--I don't think... I guess the circumstance of the parties could be such, that would be the only way to avoid great hardship."
1993.93-263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.249,473.672,"Mr. Jencks, I'm not sure I understand how you say the constitutional question can be avoided."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,501.031,515.051,"The question of the scope of inherent jurisdiction here is this case, because I think we are prepared to concede that there is such a thing as inherent jurisdiction, and in some situations it may apply to the enforcement of settlement agreements."
1993.93-263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.092,518.724,--So--
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,518.724,521.385,--Why we've adopted and suggested to the Court the rule of practice.
1993.93-263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.989,548.712,"--But we have to consider that question, don't we, whether the inherent power under the Constitution covers this?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,548.712,551.363,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and I apologize if I indicated we didn't."
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.363,553.357,What is that inherent power again?
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,557.219,568.965,"In this case, in the way we would view a proper scope of inherent jurisdiction, it would be the power to vindicate and enforce the court's own orders."
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.965,573.299,"Well, the only order that's outstanding here is an order dismissing the case."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,573.299,574.861,That's right.
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.861,576.552,That's all... that's the only order we have.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,576.552,577.804,"That's right, and that's why we believe--"
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.804,581.016,So the inherent power to enforce an order of dismissal is what we're talking about.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,581.016,586.75,"--I think... excuse me, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.174,599.137,"Yeah, but I think you just... you suggested earlier we're not talking about vacating a judgment and going forward with the preceding lawsuit."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,609.393,610.515,That's correct.
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.515,617.01,And I'm still... I still don't quite understand the concept of inherent jurisdiction to enforce the court's order to dismiss.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,617.01,620.63,Maybe you misunderstood--
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.63,622.442,I know you're not... that's not... you're arguing the other side.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,625.946,626.474,"--No, Justice Stevens, I apologize."
1993.93-263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.972,714.674,"Well, suppose in this case there had been a motion to reopen the judgment under Rule 60, and the court then had said there are problems with this settlement agreement and so I am now going to enter a new judgment which incorporates the settlement agreement and I'm going to enforce the settlement agreement if I have to, would that have been an appropriate method of proceeding and could the judge then have enforced the settlement agreement?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,714.674,717.555,"I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.135,721.035,"Why, if he could have done that in the first instance?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,721.035,745.272,"--I think that the remedy provided by Rule 60 to unwind an order or set aside an order or judgment of the court is premised on restoring the parties to the position they were before they gave up, in this case the dismissals that they reached in connection with the settlement."
1993.93-263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.409,757.6,"Well, I just want to make... get one thing clear."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,783.607,787.761,--He could have incorporated with the parties' consent.
1993.93-263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,812.447,820.452,"Well, if we're talking about the constitutional limitations on jurisdiction, why does that depend on the consent of both parties?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,820.452,834.992,"--As I under... I believe I understood you to ask if... could the court simply on its own, sua sponte, take the parties' agreement, regardless of their consent, and incorporate it in the judgment of the court."
1993.93-263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.992,839.773,"Well, suppose he said I'm not going to dismiss this suit unless it's incorporated in the judgment?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,841.465,842.136,Fine.
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.762,854.995,"--But, Mr. Jencks, doesn't that raise still another question?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,881.162,885.215,With a simple statement expressly retaining jurisdiction?
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.215,886.175,"No, without such a statement."
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,908.101,915.403,"If the basis of the settlement was recited in the judgment, I think there would be--"
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.403,916.125,And the case is dismissed.
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,916.125,917.036,--And the case was--
1993.93-263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.036,922.62,"And 4 months later one of the parties comes in and says they're not abiding by the settlement, what can the judge do?"
1993.93-263,0,36086,michael_j_jencks,,926.65,932.475,"--IF the basis... well, one of the hopes is to trigger the existing rules and remedies."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1603.794,1607.957,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.536,1657.831,But the court could say I will not dismiss unless you agree to embody this settlement agreement in my order.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1659.24,1660.973,Well--
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.973,1665.355,"And your adversary will acknowledge that if that's done, there would be... to enforce."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1665.355,1667.177,"--That's true, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.155,1691.293,"But if the court wanted to retain jurisdiction over such a breach, for... a breach in the future, it could have done just what Justice Scalia suggests, incorporate the agreement and say we retain jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1692.572,1695.394,"Well, that may be right in another case, Your Honor."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.564,1749.841,"I don't understand the petitioner to be challenging the fact that there was an agreement, so... or saying that what appears in the record was not the agreement of the parties."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1753.014,1756.266,"Yes, that is correct."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.319,1778.088,"Well, now, you say:"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1786.285,1790.818,"--When stripped of the too many adjectives, Your Honor, I think what that means is this."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1833.464,1834.536,But he didn't put it in his order.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1834.536,1834.997,--He didn't--
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.997,1837.107,He dismissed the case outright.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1837.107,1838.159,--That's... that is correct.
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.159,1866.065,"Do you... suppose your opponent is correct that there was nothing here to reopen... that there was nothing here to enforce, because all there was was a dismissal with prejudice, do you think you could go back and say, well, alternately, please consider our case under Rule 60(b)(6) and reopen the judgment because?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1874.253,1879.676,"Well, Your Honor, I think we would have available to us not only 60(b)(6), but 60(b)(3)."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.787,1898.687,But that'll just get you the lawsuit.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1901.449,1902.24,"Well, Justice Scalia, I'm not sure--"
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.24,1903.031,Do you want the lawsuit or the settlement?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1903.031,1914.508,"--Justice Scalia, I'm not sure it gets us only the lawsuit, because I believe... we would submit that once the case is properly back before the district court, the district court not only may reopen and put the lawsuit back on the calendar."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.706,1942.755,That's a little strange.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1956.135,1970.043,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what we're saying is there's reason to bring the matter bring and for the court to act, either under Rule 60 or under its ancillary jurisdiction, to give effect--"
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.043,1973.405,But the only way it can bring the matter back is to set aside the judgment and the settlement.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,1976.458,1981.09,"--Well, we believe there's ancillary jurisdiction to enforce, Your Honor, so we would part with you there."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.09,1982.192,May I ask you this question?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2001.954,2004.676,The short answer to that is--
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.676,2006.038,"To enforce the settlement agreement, I mean."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2006.038,2007.771,--To enforce... there would be no express time.
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.763,2019.375,So he... the time limit is just his sound discretion.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2019.375,2025.181,"The district court judge's sound discretion, informed by the facts of the case."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.471,2029.843,"Well, I really want to be sure I understand your position."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2035.337,2037.657,"--Perhaps tested by appeal, but, yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.657,2038.709,Yeah.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2045.455,2050.447,"Well, I think what it... it used the phrase, I believe, the inherent power."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.998,2076.172,"And you would say both of those are their... one is the equivalent of the other, inherent power or... is the same as ancillary jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2076.172,2084.429,"Well, the... I don't know that there is an absolutely precise definition if you read many cases, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.316,2119.303,"When you're using that term, are you referring... you're not referring to, like, Rule 13 or Rule 14, or 13671 you're just saying ancillary jurisdiction, inherent jurisdiction?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2119.303,2120.352,"--Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2120.352,2121.043,You have no statutory rules--
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2121.043,2127.348,"Not in the narrow... perhaps the most frequently today encountered phrase... use of the phrase, ancillary jurisdiction, that is absolutely correct."
1993.93-263,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.348,2131.191,"--Well, you say that Judge Coyle had the authority to enforce his order."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2132.749,2151.112,"Well, we believe that what he did here, in effect, with the substantial proceedings in chambers and his participation, that we had, in effect, a much... a broader order than the narrow stipulation which is all that is on... entered on the docket, the narrow stipulation in his order dismissing the case."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.747,2176.521,"Well, surely there's a parole evidence rule of some sort with respect to orders in judgment."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2192.64,2198.433,"Well, it would be our position that, in fact, we essentially have the writing of the agreement here."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.929,2207.42,But nobody doubts... no one is claiming that there was no agreement here.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2215.828,2222.44,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but our view of that is on these facts there is ancillary jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.809,2236.959,Ancillary to what?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2248.747,2249.298,Well--
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.298,2251.799,The court has... no longer has a case in front of it.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2251.799,2268.972,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we would respectfully suggest that there are a number of instances, as cited in our brief, where this Court has said that if there was once proper jurisdiction in the Federal courts, there can be ancillary jurisdiction based on that original prior Federal court jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.972,2271.433,"For example, what case do you have in mind?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2271.433,2275.004,"Well, the cases where... they come in a number of varieties."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.32,2303.203,The court has authority to enforce its orders.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2307.524,2313.91,"--Well, we have attorney's fees cases, Justice Ginsburg, where the case is dismissed but the court, after the dismissal, deals with the attorney's fees."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.906,2330.9,"Have you had... I'm... what is the contempt case you have, where after a case is dismissed a party is held in contempt for violating--"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2330.9,2338.747,"Well, the action that would be the basis occurred... would have occurred, certainly, Justice Stevens, during the live period of the case before the court."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.758,2365.514,--But are there any cases in which action taken after the case is dismissed provides the basis for contempt of court?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2366.763,2372.638,--In a contempt... I am not aware of any contempt cases--
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2372.638,2373.129,"Yeah, yeah."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2373.129,2375.189,--Where an action of a contempt nature would be after the case was dismissed.
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.189,2376.521,May I ask this question too?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2405.75,2421.771,"Well, if... it would probably... I believe the answer would probably be it would have to be those matters which would be properly--"
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.771,2422.77,Proper relief in the case.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2422.77,2423.351,--Proper relief in the case.
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.351,2426.755,And you would argue in this case everything that was agreed to was something the judge could have ordered?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2426.755,2427.756,"Yes, absolutely."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2451.211,2460.387,"It would be too late now for a 60(b)(3)... not for 60(b)(6), but you'd be too late, wouldn't you, because you didn't move for that originally?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2460.387,2462.698,It may be or it may not be.
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.182,2490.738,Or that you could treat your original motion for enforcement as though it were a 60(b)(3) motion.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2490.738,2503.274,"And we would suggest more than that, Justice Ginsburg, that, in fact, our original motion to enforce, appropriate under the Ninth Circuit law at the time, did all that a 60(b)(3) motion could have done."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.079,2515.381,Did you make any reference to Rule 60(b) in your motion?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2515.381,2516.422,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.422,2520.294,Then it would be a rather strange thing to treat it as a Rule 60(b) motion.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2520.294,2530.262,"Well, there are cases cited in our brief and Professor Morris' treatise that say Rule 60 is to be liberally construed, and there is some authority for treating it liberally."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.541,2549.246,"Well, 60(b) is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge, is it not?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2549.246,2550.434,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.434,2553.686,"And a motion to enforce, I take it, would not be."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2563.454,2568.947,"If we're proceeding under Rule 60, that's... I believe that would be correct."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.824,2649.13,"Mr. Morris, can I give you an example that's based on many years ago that I bumped into many times in practice, and see if you... have you comment."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2668.091,2669.594,No.
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.743,2672.825,"It, of course, is a classic settlement."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2672.825,2682.262,"--Well, it's... a consent decree, I think almost by virtue of its very nature, will have exactly the provision that you have described."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.708,2695.79,"But was it necessary in a Government suit against a couple of newspapers, or something like that?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2698.592,2702.855,"Well, it certainly is the safer procedure and it eliminates the possible position we have here."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.855,2703.376,--Yeah.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2703.376,2707.187,"No question but what... if that language is there, we resolve the problem."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.187,2711.211,"It's just I have to confess to you, a lot of lawyers thought it was necessary."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2711.211,2711.731,"Oh, I agree."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.731,2712.609,And I was one of them.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2712.609,2713.03,Well--
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.03,2714.031,"And you're telling me it wasn't, really."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2714.031,2728.161,"--Well, I think the better, prudent practice would be to do so, and certainly in a consent decree where there is probably a notion of a more vigilant district court role in enforcing the terms of a consent decree."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.123,2769.017,"When you found yourself in this position, that the other side, in your judgment, had not carried out the bargain, did you find other cases in the district court and in the Ninth Circuit where, despite the failure to reserve jurisdiction, parties were able to enforce a settlement agreement that was not incorporated in the judgment?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2769.017,2781.807,"Well, there are cases that we have cited in our brief where dismissals have been set aside and where settlement agreements that have been breached were enforced by the district courts."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.929,2809.603,"Would you have had a cause of action in State court as well, or do you think this was your exclusive remedy?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2809.603,2811.486,"No, I do not believe it is our exclusive remedy."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.759,2844.929,"And the reason you would not have access to the Federal court for this enforcement proceeding, if it was a de novo proceeding, is you no longer have diversity and a mounting controversy?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2845.767,2850.342,"Well, we would not concede that we no longer have diversity jurisdiction."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.224,2882.211,"So when your adversary says you have recourse to a State court for breach-of-contract suit, you say that you could bring that as a diversity suit as well, that you meet the requirements of diversity--"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2882.211,2884.624,"I believe that is correct, Judge Ginsburg."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.367,2896.483,"--Of course, the big difference, I suppose, is if you can go back the way you want to go back in... and maybe you should be allowed to... you're going to get it decided very promptly."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2899.953,2905.298,"That's precisely the point that we make, and that's where we do think the important policies around settlement come in here."
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2905.298,2906.687,And you might not get Judge... what is it?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2906.687,2907.078,Coyle.
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.078,2907.739,Yeah.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2909.619,2912.892,I would assume that we could say that this was a related... yeah.
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2915.724,2916.605,You're reopening the same judgment--
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2916.605,2917.045,--Yes.
1993.93-263,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2926.692,2932.277,"--Of course, then he'd be a party with access to evidentiary facts that are in dispute, and you might have to recuse."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,2933.776,2937.279,"Well, perhaps, perhaps, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2998.748,3002.902,"What... if I may interrupt you, what about the fact that he said I don't want to see you back here?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3002.902,3012.117,"--Well, that's an interesting... that's a good question, Justice Souter, because when you first read that you could easily draw the opposite conclusion; go anyplace, but don't come back to my courtroom."
1993.93-263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3061.14,3065.971,Then why didn't you ask him to amend his judgment because it failed to embody what he had intended?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3071.875,3076.99,"Well, in retrospect it clearly would have been better had we done so... in retrospect."
1993.93-263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3080.291,3090.178,"But in any of your submissions to the court did you claim that the judgment entered was, in fact, mistaken in failing to embody the settlement--"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3090.178,3091.11,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1993.93-263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.11,3093.11,--As a result of your conversation... the conversation on the record?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3093.11,3096.182,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.627,3161.885,"I guess this means that a district judge can't avoid getting himself entangled in the future disputes of a settlement agreement, even if he wants to."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3182.271,3185.343,"That's not our contention, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.343,3185.882,--Why isn't it?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3185.882,3194.178,"In rare circumstances, the facts of the district court's involvement will justify the district court judge making the determination."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.178,3197.28,"Well, he's involved... whenever he's involved in the settlement, which often happens."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3206.246,3207.246,"Well, I think--"
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.246,3209.277,But the terms of the settlement are... have to be set forth in--
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3209.277,3218.513,"--I... because we believe its discretion... I believe it's going to take more, frankly, for the court to decide that it will exercise its discretion than just that it heard the terms."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.051,3235.184,--This is discretionary jurisdiction?
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3236.625,3237.055,That is correct.
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.055,3238.237,--This ancillary jurisdiction.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3238.915,3239.646,Ancillary jurisdiction is discretionary.
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.646,3240.778,--Just if it wants to.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3240.778,3241.669,If it wants to.
1993.93-263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.22,3251.214,"So this judge could have said, I've presided over dozens and dozens of settlements, I don't remember this one from any other, go away, and you would have nothing to complain about."
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3251.214,3252.616,"--Nothing... we would not complain, Your Honor."
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.474,3270.538,"Did you say as a form of Federal jurisdiction, that the judge can just decide I don't want to take the case?"
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3272.048,3272.499,--Discretionary.
1993.93-263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.87,3275.38,--Discretionary jurisdiction.
1993.93-263,1,24273,frank_c_morris_jr,,3275.38,3283.785,"It's ancillary jurisdiction, and if one looks at the historical ancillary precedents, the issue is whether or not the court believes that there is a reason to step back in."
1993.93-263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.785,3293.823,"Except, maybe it's not ancillary... yes, ancillary jurisdiction, some of it is discretionary, but if you consider this inherent jurisdiction I think it's a lot harder to run that argument."
1993.93-263,2,36086,michael_j_jencks,,3298.154,3299.787,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-263,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3368.512,3373.605,"From what... from your point of view, having made that concession, what is involved here other than a misnomer?"
1993.93-263,2,36086,michael_j_jencks,,3393.74,3407.097,"--I think there's a difference whether we choose... whether either of the parties chooses to go back on a 60(b) motion to reopen the previous proceedings, or to enforce the settlement agreement."
1993.93-263,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.278,3424.749,"You... as I understand your argument, you say that he can go on 60(b)."
1993.93-263,2,36086,michael_j_jencks,,3431.004,3432.546,Thank you.
1993.93-263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3432.546,3433.729,"Thank you, Mr. Jencks."
