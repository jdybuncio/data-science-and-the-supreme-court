1962.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.468,177.008,I want to be sure I have the link to each share -- it's Grace Lines which owns --
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,177.008,180.541,"No, it's W.R. Grace and Company which owns Grace Lines."
1962.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.541,181.387,Grace Lines.
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,181.387,183.126,These are two subsidiaries.
1962.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.126,183.478,I see.
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,187.514,190.128,That's correct and Pan Am the other.
1962.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,190.128,192.768,And that Grace Line is a separate subsidiary of W.R. Grace --
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,192.768,195.308,"Fully owned, I believe."
1962.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.48,342.782,"Of course, this long before the days of the CAB?"
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,342.782,345.669,This was long before the days of the CAB which was established in 1938.

1962.23,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,584.031,588.811,Does the President still have to approve these overseas --
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,588.811,596.527,"A transfer or issuance of a certificate involving overseas air carrier, yes."
1962.23,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,596.527,600.692,What was that -- what is the case where we hear -- the Court held I think I just --
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,600.692,602.969,Chicago and Southern --
1962.23,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,602.969,605.776,That that actually the President does not review it.
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,605.776,611.201,"It was not reviewable and that there was no -- as I remember it, it was no jurisdiction to --"
1962.23,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,611.201,615.554,Do we have underlying in this case that presidential decision that this --
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,615.554,616.517,"No, because this --"
1962.23,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,616.517,618.999,(Voice Overlap) this territory shall be divided up.
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,618.999,625.255,"No, there's no presidential decision here except the decision that Braniff should be certificated."
1962.23,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,632.379,638.561,"Well, some of the extensions of Panagra I think took place afterwards, didn't they?"
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,638.561,648.313,"But I don't think those would have to be some of the extensions (Voice Overlap) it might have been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board but that wouldn't, as I understand it, require presidential action."
1962.23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.313,653.402,What the (Inaudible)
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,653.402,654.881,"No, they had grandfather rights."
1962.23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.881,658.848,"Well, does the grandfather rights require that or --"
1962.23,0,15704,archibald_cox,,658.848,659.593,That was automatic.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4179.589,4183.79,May it please the Court.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4332.176,4336.718,"And yet when there were only two, they granted the -- they granted a certificate to a third one, didn't they?"
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4336.718,4340.809,"No, I think -- let me get that straight Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4354.057,4354.816,They (Voice Overlap) Panagra.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4354.816,4357.26,-- they have always regarded Panagra as a part --
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4357.26,4358.326,As a part.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4358.326,4360.951,-- of the Pan American system.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4446.902,4452.399,"(Inaudible) Judge Peck, certainly that's just what the District Court did."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4452.399,4454.54,That's what the District Court did.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4454.54,4457.032,On the basis of finding that there was a violation of Section 2.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4457.032,4469.127,"And I -- my second point after I cover why the District Court was right in the first part of its decision, is why it was all wrong in the second part of its decision."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4469.127,4478.216,But then the theory was that the -- that Pan American was exercising monopoly power in excluding this competitor from going into the United States (Voice Overlap) --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4478.216,4480.832,I do not take it that that was the Government theory.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4481.38,4482.561,Was that the District Court's theory?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4482.561,4484.304,-- anything of that kind in the complaint.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4484.304,4487.949,Was that the District Court's theory?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4487.949,4489.16,It was Grace's theory.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4639.237,4640.355,"Judge, may I interrupt you for a moment --"
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4640.355,4641.048,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4641.048,4646.409,-- but did not the Government charge this as one of the elements in the Government's complaint?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4646.409,4660.875,"The Government, I will hope from their brief, they say that what Pan American did in respect to this route extension supported in part, that's the language of their brief, supported in part the illegal combination."
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4664.372,4666.408,What about the complaint that the Government (Voice Overlap) --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4666.408,4667.218,The complaint --
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4667.218,4670.15,-- substantive allegation of the complaint?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4670.15,4673.626,There -- I again regard it as evidentiary.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4673.674,4678.357,Did they charge the Section 2 violation in the complaint?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4678.357,4681.705,But only in the combination.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4686.954,4692.82,"Well, I -- I was reading the statement from it and one of the statements was that Pan American use this 50% --"
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4692.82,4693.087,That's right.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4693.087,4693.704,-- full --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4693.704,4694.185,That's right.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4694.185,4697.651,-- to prevent Panagra from securing authorities from the Civil Aeronautics Board.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4697.651,4713.742,What they say is supporting in part this whole illegal combination but they say it all stems from the illegality of the combination in the setup in the beginning of this joint ownership and joint organization.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4714.828,4721.523,"At that point in the -- in that episode and throughout the history of this thing, this was hardly a combination."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4724.846,4728.509,It became such beginning about the year 1938 --
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4728.509,4731.104,And certainly with reference to getting a certificate to --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4731.104,4731.219,Yes.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4731.219,4731.842,-- United States.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4731.842,4732.604,Yes.
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4893.629,4897.387,(Inaudible)
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4897.387,4907.653,"There was at that time, Mr. Justice White, no American airline industry in South America at all."
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4907.653,4912.836,I agree with that but for purposes of nominal trade (Inaudible)
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,4912.836,4914.361,"On the -- oh yes, yes, yes."
1962.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5152.235,5154.435,When was that report made?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5154.435,5161.688,"This was in 1928, when Panagra started."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5222.838,5232.753,"Whole history that you've given us shows that there was an airline, an existing airline in the east coast of South America and they are creating one for the west coast, isn't that right?"
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5232.753,5236.333,The east and west coast were -- started almost simultaneously.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5236.333,5236.816,They were.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5236.816,5237.782,Almost simultaneous.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5237.782,5239.163,Pan American has not been operating?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5239.163,5240.037,"No, no."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5240.037,5240.909,It was operating where?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5241.908,5247.456,If it just gotten its mail contract from the United States to the Canal Zone.
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5253.279,5253.672,I see.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5254.751,5256.834,All -- all -- all already together.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5692.936,5698.707,It would get the business that having from the west coast but not the east coast --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5698.707,5701.147,"Oh no, I'm -- you're quite right, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5728.745,5730.266,Why do you come to that conclusion?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5736.859,5743.087,Because they would be able to have so many more airplanes carrying the through traffic.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5743.087,5746.208,More than Pan American would with its big east coast traffic?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,5746.208,5748.534,"Yes, because the east coast traffic doesn't go that way."
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6250.12,6252.301,Are those from Pan Am crew?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6252.301,6256.442,"No, they're Panagra crew."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6300.422,6305.177,And then certiorari was granted and then later (Voice Overlap) --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6305.177,6308.789,"Certiorari was granted, the case was dismissed as moot upon --"
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6308.789,6309.338,Agreement.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6309.338,6316.576,-- the through flight -- the establishment of the through flight agreement which is the best evidence that the whole controversy was settled.
1962.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6404.255,6409.408,May I ask you if in this argument you are challenging the finding of the judge?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6409.408,6414.004,I'm challenging the finding of the judge which is wholly an inference.
1962.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6419.107,6424.125,Is that true with reference to some of the other arguments that you've made?
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6424.125,6434.349,I think that you can all -- we say this that all one has to do is read the decision of the District Court and know that it's an error.
1962.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6434.349,6445.696,"To that finding, and I know you're challenging others, is there any place in your brief where you have set out the findings that you challenge -- I've been a little confused because I couldn't -- didn't understand which."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6445.696,6455.229,"Not in the -- not in the sense that you would approach a case and say, here's finding number one, number two and number three, we don't agree with that."
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6468.548,6481.868,This issue is an effect of the remand (Inaudible)
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6481.868,6483.167,I would say it -- yes.
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6510.572,6515.538,(Inaudible)
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6515.538,6519.009,"I agree with that observation Mr. Justice White, yes indeed."
1962.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6596.661,6601.753,"You got -- back in 1928, this is describing Grace's frame of mind back in 1928."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6601.753,6609.299,"Now -- I'm sorry that I'm -- I have to go -- then I'll have to just say this, if the Court please."
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6923.491,6938.661,"Before you leave, you refer to the Court of Appeals decision in the Second Circuit, and in fact said, that the injunction would be adequate under the antitrust laws because under that opinion, that could have been achieved through the CAB."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6949.065,6953.018,It obviously was not doing that because that wasn't the --
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6953.018,6953.54,Wasn't the --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6953.54,6954.745,-- wasn't the case.
1962.23,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6955.335,6961.84,So that even the proceeding that they have permitted would not have affect through the antitrust (Voice Overlap) --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,6961.84,6972.019,"I readily agree as a legal finding but I'm saying that what it said in its process of reasoning in the rightness thereof, applies very squarely here."
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7024.947,7026.252,One more questions Judge --
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,7026.252,7027.772,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7029.381,7036.25,I understand that you agree with the District Court's conclusion that it's the legality of this combination.
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,7051.902,7056.528,That certain -- it certainly is my position in this case.
1962.23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7072.855,7079.887,"Well, you said that part of your argument as to why it was legal was that there weren't airlines there at all."
1962.23,1,21349,david_w_peck,,7093.804,7111.141,"There is now because these people created it (Voice Overlap) and I think having created something commendably and legally, they're entitled to keep it unless they've abused it in some way and certainly Pan American in my opinion, our submission hasn't abused it in any way."
1962.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7125.787,7132.363,Mr. Mckay.
1962.23,2,34799,lawrence_j_mckay,,7132.363,7136.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1962.23,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7216.004,7221.31,But didn't you win that case in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit?
1962.23,2,34799,lawrence_j_mckay,,7221.31,7223.094,"Mr. Justice Black, the --"
1962.23,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7223.094,7223.959,Douglas was the name.
1962.23,2,34799,lawrence_j_mckay,,7223.959,7226.283,"Oh I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1962.23,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7263.234,7265.706,"So the case was dismissed here, I think."
1962.23,2,34799,lawrence_j_mckay,,7265.706,7274.451,Pan American after the matter was entered into one of the through flight moved and had it dismissed on the grounds of mootness and it was dismissed.
1962.23,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7616.074,7624.884,But I gather that you don't consider the interchange agreement in any way even close to an equivalent of -- about the certificate for Panagra.
1962.23,2,34799,lawrence_j_mckay,,7624.884,7633.895,Civil Aeronautics Board and I believe all the air carriers were all in agreement but an interchange is a very poor substitute for one zone route.
1962.23,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7664.434,7682.947,"And it also suggested that far from a monopoly, the route from the United States to the Canal Zone is very competitive that there are some eight other carriers and that this is an international operation now because of the geographical location of the airport in Panama rather than in the Canal Zone."
