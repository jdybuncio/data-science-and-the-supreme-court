1996.95-891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.346,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-891, Ohio v. Robert D. Robinette."
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,10.989,14.512,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,36.426,45.364,"Under State law, does the officer have the discretion to give or not to give a ticket after he talks to the motorist?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,45.364,59.092,"Your Honor, there is a statute that... if it is a traffic stop, the officer may simply cite the motorist if he has proof of identification, which doesn't have to be a driver's license."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,59.092,62.205,Does... is cite the same as giving a ticket?
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,62.205,64.248,"Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.389,73.184,"So he may cite or warn, and that obviously takes a certain amount of time to make that determination of what he's going to do?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,78.216,78.736,"Yes, he does."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,78.736,81.969,And so he has to have a certain amount of time within which to exercise that discretion.
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,81.969,83.481,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.481,86.203,"Once he says, I'm not going to give you a ticket, can he change his mind?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,86.203,90.897,"He could change is mind, certainly, and give the ticket."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.897,98.101,"If there's a flippant response, or a response that indicates that maybe the person has less regard for the law than the officer thought at first?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,98.101,113.101,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and the question would then become whether or not the officer's decision to change his mind when he told the person he wasn't going to give him the ticket and then decided to give the ticket would have an effect on whether or not the person felt then that he was free to leave, or he was being coerced in some--"
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,113.101,122.387,"Quite without reference to a search, the officer would be entitled to detain the motorist after the officer changed his mind and said, well, based on what your remarks are, I've changed my mind."
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,123.469,124.581,"--Yes, the officer could do that."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.581,130.214,There is no right to leave once the officer proceeds in that way until the ticket is written.
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,130.214,133.326,"Right, that's correct, until the ticket is written or the warning is given, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-891,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.326,137.387,"And that State law is consistent with our cases, and with the Fourth Amendment?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,137.387,138.498,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-891,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,138.498,140.55,Let me ask you another nuts and bolts question.
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,158.594,160.077,"Your Honor, it can be done both ways."
1996.95-891,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,166.22,176.906,"So he had given him a statement which said, in effect, on its face that it was a warning before he began the conversation about whether there was anything improper in the car?"
1996.95-891,0,19261,carley_j_ingram,,176.906,179.748,"Yes, Your Honor, and he had also returned his driver's license to him--"
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1128.645,1145.427,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.456,1166.659,"Supposing we disagree with that holding, is it nevertheless true that we might affirm the judgment in this case?"
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1166.659,1168.402,--I think that you should not--
1996.95-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.402,1170.602,"I understand that, but is it legal--"
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1170.602,1182.57,"--It is possible, if you concluded that on the totality of the circumstances in this case the respondent would not have felt free to leave in light of the officer's conduct in this case, you could affirm the judgment."
1996.95-891,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1190.567,1195.34,--Why would we make that judgment?
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1200.555,1211.864,"The Ohio supreme court, itself, has not made that judgment except based on the free-to-leave warning rule which appears in the syllabus."
1996.95-891,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.864,1215.417,Which appears in the opinion after it had made the other judgment.
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1215.417,1223.292,But the first point in the syllabus presupposes--
1996.95-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.292,1224.344,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Gornstein?"
1996.95-891,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1224.344,1226.945,--This is from App 1 in the petition.
1996.95-891,2,32507,james_d__ruppert,,1730.235,1736.699,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1996.95-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.919,1836.976,"Well now, Mr. Ruppert, as I recall, the Ohio supreme court appeared to be interpreting Federal law here, and cited a number of Federal cases, and in general Ohio has followed the Federal interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, isn't that true?"
1996.95-891,2,32507,james_d__ruppert,,1836.976,1843.741,"I would agree that in some cases, but the Ohio court has also recognized its inherent power to reject--"
1996.95-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.741,1868.769,"Well, there's no question that Ohio could adopt this per se rule as a matter of Ohio law if it wants to, but unless it's clear from the face of the opinion that it has rejected the Federal rule and is adopting something as a matter of State law only, under Michigan v. Long we assume that it's interwoven with Federal law and we have jurisdiction."
1996.95-891,2,32507,james_d__ruppert,,1868.769,1869.63,--I understand--
1996.95-891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.63,1875.672,I think your position would require us to reject or overturn Michigan v. Long.
1996.95-891,2,32507,james_d__ruppert,,1875.672,1889.302,"--I don't think so in my first analysis, Justice O'Connor, and my reason for saying that is when one looks at the syllabus, which indicates the right which the court is addressing is guaranteed by the Federal and Ohio constitution."
1996.95-891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.559,1918.841,"But Mr. Ruppert, in Michigan v. Long we talked about opinions of State courts, not syllabi, and although Ohio may have a special rule as to the holding of its court, I think Michigan v. Long would require us to look at the opinion rather than just the syllabus to decide whether the Michigan v. Long test is satisfied."
1996.95-891,2,32507,james_d__ruppert,,1918.841,1925.056,"I would agree with the Chief Justice that would be appropriate, Your Honor."
1996.95-891,3,19261,carley_j_ingram,,3130.205,3133.079,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-891,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.7,3167.934,Am I correct that you think the detention ended when the officer gave him the driver's license back?
1996.95-891,3,19261,carley_j_ingram,,3167.934,3168.595,--Yes.
1996.95-891,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.595,3170.485,But it continued up until then?
1996.95-891,3,19261,carley_j_ingram,,3170.485,3173.567,"Yes, and it was lawful, lawfully continued until then."
1996.95-891,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.559,3176.18,"Thank you, Ms. Ingram."
1996.95-891,3,19261,carley_j_ingram,,3176.18,3176.57,--reject... thank you.
1996.95-891,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.57,3178.07,The case is submitted.
