2000.99-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.715,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-603, Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, and United States v. Velazquez."
2000.99-603,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,69.557,71.415,"Levine, Your Honor."
2000.99-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,71.415,72.158,Levine.
2000.99-603,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,72.158,78.557,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2000.99-603,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.472,196.784,"Mr. Levine, does the statute at issue here in your view prohibit a Legal Aid attorney representing an individual client from making a constitutional challenge to the application of a particular welfare law?"
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,978.073,999.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-603,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.0,1012.319,Are there limits?
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1012.319,1013.972,"There are limits, and the principal--"
2000.99-603,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1013.972,1015.003,And what are they?
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1015.003,1039.895,"--The only situation in which this Court has struck down a Government funding restriction on viewpoint grounds was in the Rosenberger case, and in that case, what the Court held is, there the university had made funds available to encourage a broad diversity of private expression and had created what this Court there termed a public forum and reiterated in the NEA case that--"
2000.99-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.895,1049.061,"Well, in Rosenberger I do think that the Government wasn't paying for the speaker, and here it's paying for the speaker."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1086.296,1092.445,"--Well, Congress did not establish the Legal Services Corporation and the program under it as a public forum."
2000.99-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.17,1136.368,It's a paradigm of free speech.
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1139.711,1152.221,"--It is, but as this Court said in the Walters case and the Yorkline case, the First Amendment really doesn't add anything to what has been the traditional source of constitutional guidance in that area, which has been the Due Process Clause."
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1152.221,1188.563,"Well, but it does add something, because given the fact, as Justice Kennedy has just pointed out, given the limitations that this kind of forum involve restrictions on relevance and so on, there still is a speech, a central speech element in what's going on here, and there is a general principle, I think, that when the Government takes action to disfavor speech simply because it disagrees with the Government, you're getting just about to the molten core of the First Amendment."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1210.854,1212.523,With all respect--
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1212.523,1214.735,So that's what I think is extra here.
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1217.875,1228.194,"--But there are many situations in our legal system in which Congress has enacted laws that favor one litigant over another, one sort of claim over another, the furnishing--"
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.194,1229.43,This isn't merely favoring.
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1235.846,1236.3,--No.
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1242.244,1242.699,"Well, yeah."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1270.191,1276.218,"--Well, any speech that would happen in a courtroom first of all is not the lawyer's own self expression."
2000.99-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.235,1286.704,Is the Government the client?
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1286.704,1301.027,"The Government is not the client, but what the Government is, is, it is the Government that established the program and, as this Court held in Rust, that when the Government establishes a program, it is entitled to encourage certain activities and not others, and--"
2000.99-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.027,1314.856,"Well, but we said in Forbes, the public television case, that when the Government established its forum you have to give certain discretion to the immediate speaker to preserve the integrity of the message."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1329.057,1337.064,"--In Forbes it is possible to think of what was going on there as a debate, and classically a debate among candidates about political issues."
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1344.828,1356.838,"Well, the terms of the debate by the lawyer may not be political, but the lawyer's raising of constitutional issues is normally a direct response to what, in fact, is the result of a political debate."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1363.421,1374.007,"--No, but once the matter has been reduced out of the lobbying or the political sphere into the litigation sphere, we have a set of procedural and substantive rules that have legal consequences."
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1378.282,1390.436,"Well, that's right, but if I may just cut you short a little bit on that, those rules allow for challenges to what are political determinations by the Congress."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1393.847,1406.683,"If I could just go back to the Rust case, what the Court said there, and it is very similar, because it had to do with the furnishing of particular services, and particular types of expression were not permitted under that program."
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1406.683,1408.375,But it was Government expression.
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1408.375,1410.604,"No, it was... I... it was not--"
2000.99-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1410.604,1420.718,"The doctors, I thought, were hired to give the Government's message, and only that message, to the people that they counseled."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1420.718,1427.944,"--I don't think that's a fair characterization of the program in Rust, and in fact the respondents in this case concede that the Government was not the speaker."
2000.99-603,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.579,1454.072,May I ask--
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1454.072,1459.606,"--some types of services are outside the scope of the program, and that's exactly what Congress said here."
2000.99-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.606,1474.733,"--Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you a question about... and you keep bringing up Rust, and it seems to me that whatever else is wrong with this, it fails the line that runs from Speiser v. Randolph."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1492.194,1493.786,If I could make two responses to that.
2000.99-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1524.788,1535.479,"And so the same lawyer could present this... the argument without any inhibition, using the counterpart organization."
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1535.479,1539.483,--The... it would... the matter would have to be presented by the counterpart organization.
2000.99-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1592.365,1596.619,"Well, this would be tagged onto, say, State funds, this restriction, as well as--"
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1596.619,1600.167,This fund does... this restriction does apply to State funds.
2000.99-603,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.167,1603.057,"--Mr. Kneedler, let me... would you just clear up one factual thing for me?"
2000.99-603,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1610.57,1611.041,Yes.
2000.99-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.385,1615.582,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1617.357,1630.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.334,1717.628,"You can put it that way, but you can just as readily put it, may the Government fund representation in cases that raise certain issues and not fund representation in cases that involve other issues."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1732.793,1733.077,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.5,1757.226,"What's wrong with a category of case that involves welfare recipients, but does not involve a challenge to the constitutionality of the welfare law, or the validity of regulations enacted under the welfare law?"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1759.083,1764.468,"What's wrong with it, Justice Scalia, is that it is overtly viewpoint based."
2000.99-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.19,1796.047,It doesn't favor one side or the other.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1810.702,1813.675,"With respect, this is a unique restriction."
2000.99-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.31,1831.341,But it hasn't said that.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1838.566,1839.598,"Yes, but that's simply--"
2000.99-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.598,1840.795,There's a big difference.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1840.795,1845.996,"--Well, with respect, I don't believe so, because all it does is impose an unconstitutional condition on the subsidy."
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.197,1874.564,"What if the statute said, Mr. Neuborne, that these Legal Service lawyers could represent low income clients seeking welfare benefits, but they... once a case went to court, they could not handle it?"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1874.564,1877.947,"In other words, a categorical restriction saying no welfare cases."
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.947,1881.54,"Well, at the administrative level, yes--"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1881.54,1881.623,Yes.
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.623,1882.178,--but you--
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1882.178,1883.109,That would be--
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.109,1884.019,--we won't fund you going into court.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1884.019,1885.793,"--That, Chief Justice, would be a very different case."
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.348,1888.022,What would be your answer to that?
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1888.022,1892.414,--There is... it would depend on the motive with which the restriction was imposed.
2000.99-603,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.581,1908.372,"Well, why wasn't Rust a situation involving some kind of viewpoint discrimination under your view?"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1910.313,1921.459,"--Under the Court's decision in Rust, a fundamental distinction was raised, and if I could compare two cases that the Chief Justice wrote, I think it demonstrates that."
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.972,1957.679,"Well, Mr. Neuborne, Rust doesn't say where the Government wishes to expound its own... Rust didn't say that the Government is the speaker."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1957.679,1963.235,"--Well, my understanding, Chief Justice, is that is the way the Court has construed subsequent cases."
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.235,1969.551,"Well, are you talking about the Rust opinion... you say you're going to compare two cases which I wrote, one of them being TWR--"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1969.551,1969.817,I'm sorry.
2000.99-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.817,1971.037,--and one being Rust.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,1973.971,1975.124,That'll teach me to do that.
2000.99-603,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.04,2009.97,"Well, maybe here the Government has a welfare program and they believe in it, and they don't want it challenged."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2009.97,2016.557,"--Well, but that point of view... yes, the only difference here is that the Government does have a Rust speaker in this case."
2000.99-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.043,2028.9,"It's not the Government's lawyer, it's the client's lawyer."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2028.9,2032.244,"--No, what I meant, the Government, the other lawyer in the case--"
2000.99-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2032.244,2032.532,Oh.
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2032.532,2036.126,--is the speaker that would fall within the Rust parameters.
2000.99-603,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2081.163,2089.418,"Mr. Neuborne, I want to get you to state your first premise, and I think it's this, but if I'm wrong, that's what I want to find out."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2095.364,2095.819,--Yes.
2000.99-603,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2095.819,2106.138,"You've got another principle that says, the Government cannot use its leverage, whether it be by subsidization or otherwise, to engage in viewpoint discrimination."
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2106.138,2106.715,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-603,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2106.715,2127.399,"Is your basic principle that whenever a given set of facts could be characterized by either one or the other of those principles, that the First Amendment principle always prevails, that trumps the other one, that there always should be a choice to characterize the issue as a speech issue, not as a mere subsidization issue?"
2000.99-603,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2127.399,2133.647,"I'm not sure I understand what... your question, but I'll try to answer it."
2000.99-603,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.2,2138.666,He's asking you if Rust has to be overruled to decide this case.
2000.99-603,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3438.55,3440.862,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-603,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3726.272,3727.099,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
