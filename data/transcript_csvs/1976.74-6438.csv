1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.052,We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-6438 Scott against Kentucky.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,22.785,23.66,Thank you.
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,102.346,107.582,How do you explain Weinstein against Brad verdict on that basis?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,107.582,113.415,"In this case Your Honor, the petitioner Scott is on parole until 1984."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,125.435,128.738,"But he was on parole, was he not?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,128.738,136.279,"When the case was here and the decision was rendered mooting the case, the petitioner Bradford was off parole."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,136.279,138.328,He has served his full time and was not even subject to parole?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,138.328,140.428,"Yes, he had served his full sentence, that is right."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.478,147.685,"Well, Mr Rivkin one another question, if I may?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,147.685,148.236,Yes.
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.236,156.708,"If, now being on parole, his parole is sought to be revoked, he would get a Morrissey type hearing, would he not?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,156.708,163.223,"Yes, he would, during that, that is right, but he would be returned…"
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.223,170.177,That is because he now has a conditional liberty outside the walls of the institution.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,170.177,171.596,"Under the terms of Morrissey, that is right."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.255,183.301,This sentence you mean?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,183.301,186.182,"This sentence, that is right, excuse me."
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.081,205.607,"Those are not two separate grounds, but together they are one ground."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,205.607,206.253,That is right.
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.297,210.711,That is capable of repetition yet evading review?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,210.711,212.934,That is right.
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.624,215.807,"Right, yes."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,215.807,222.422,"Secondly, we believe that this case should be treated and maintained as a class action."
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.706,277.658,"That is, if it is a class action."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,277.658,283.057,"If, regardless of formal certification these cases hold and they permit intervention and that is my third point."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,295.219,297.7,Did you do that in Court of Appeals?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,297.7,302.33,"No, in the Court of Appeals the name petitioner Scott was still in prison, he had not been paroled yet."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.33,305.113,But did you move to have it certify as a class action?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,305.113,306.495,"No, we did not move that in the Court of Appeals."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.495,309.875,You could have had intervention in Court of Appeals without any problem.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,309.875,313.217,There was no necessity to have it then Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.252,328.804,"I think I read in brief that you had hundreds of these guys who are claimants at your door, so why did not you put some more of them in there, just as a precaution?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,333.244,335.622,I would like to think so.
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,335.622,336.849,"Well, why did not you?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,336.849,347.944,"We chose out of ten or twelve individuals, we chose two whose statements seem to us representative or most representative of the class with the best factual situations."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,352.142,357.546,"I guess, you could not make it a -- the Court of Appeals could not have certified, even if you had asked them."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,357.546,359.327,I do not think so Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.17,368.201,They do not certify because of mootness.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,368.201,371.978,The certification of the class I believe would have dispelled any mootness.
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,371.978,381.084,If you had asked for the certification in the Court of Appeals; my question is could the Court of Appeals certify?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,381.084,392.477,"I believe they could have, but we found no reason to, I am afraid, that the case was a live controversy, Scott was in prison and there was just no necessity to do that."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.477,393.73,"Well, then I misunderstood you."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,398.353,404.997,"That is right, we would have moved for Rule 23 certification."
1976.74-6438,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.997,406.757,You did not in the Court of Appeals?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,406.757,408.669,"We did not, no."
1976.74-6438,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,413.226,420.322,"The Court of appeals mentioned in passing or in describing the case, as I recall, that it was a class action."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,420.322,425.934,"That is right, so did the district judge, Your Honor, and I think, they in fact treated it as a class action."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,531.92,540.28,Would you agree that the State Legislature can simply abandon a parole system entirely?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,540.28,541.246,"Yes, I do."
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.167,707.344,Who attends the five or ten minutes hearing?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,707.344,713.174,The hearing is attended by normally all members of Parole Board and the prisoner.
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.174,713.694,That is all?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,713.694,715.851,"That is all, yes."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,730.641,738.889,"Legislature provides for no hearing if they wanted to, that there is no presence of the prisoner, would you think that?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,738.889,745.58,"That exist in I think three states, Georgia, North Carolina and one other state, there is no hearing at all required."
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.191,771.45,Hearing to find how?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,771.45,785.393,"A meaningful hearing, a hearing in which the individual is given an opportunity to present evidence, a statement, a meeting whatever adverse evidence is in the file against the individual."
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.127,803.82,With Court’s assistance…
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,803.82,810.496,"We believe that assistance by an advocate, whether an attorney or a lay advocate would be essential."
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.121,835.417,And would you allow prior access to the…
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,835.417,838.553,We also believe that that is one of the ingredients of due process.
1976.74-6438,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.387,841.08,Before the actual hearing?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,841.08,842.356,Before the actual hearing.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.942,887.361,"Mr. Rivkin in your brief, I notice was filed before this Court’s decision in Meachum against Fano."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,891.037,893.803,"I plan to Your Honor, yes."
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.803,909.101,"With your oral submission here and answers to the questions of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Brennan have not deviated from your brief, I would say on specifically 2 (b) one, two, three and four of the last 20 pages of your brief."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,910.212,910.557,That is right.
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,980.8,987.955,"As part of your argument, to the extent we have allowed you to make is directed to the claimant liberty."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,987.955,989.479,That is right Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.196,995.048,Let us assume that you have persuaded us that liberty is involved.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1004.032,1012.209,We think that the notion of deprivation in this instance is met both under the cases of this Court and the realities of the system.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.885,1094.683,"When you say, illegitimate criteria, is not under Kentucky law the decision of the Board is final?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1094.683,1099.179,There is review available in the Kentucky Courts.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.547,1137.098,"To that extent and the State has set up some system within its own jurisdiction for correcting illegitimate, what you call use of illegitimate criteria?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1137.098,1141.722,The Court has indicated on one occasion that it would review for abuse of discretion.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.447,1164.651,Did the State Court put it on a federal constitutional ground?
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1164.651,1171.546,"No, it was solely on and it sounded in administrative law in the same."
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1190.172,1195.045,Would you say parole as grace and then you speak out as a pre-Morrissey decision.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1203.887,1208.942,"No, Morrissey rejected the characterization of parole as grace."
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.942,1210.959,I would not have thought so.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1223.677,1226.448,That is right that was the holding of Morrissey.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.448,1233.395,That certainly does not hold that parole or granting or denial of parole is not a matter of grace.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1233.395,1234.976,It is a matter of discretion.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.907,1251.606,"Well, now why do you say that the Court rejected that in Morrissey?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1251.606,1262.242,"I believe it explicitly said that we reject the characterization of parole as either a right or a privilege, and we will look on it as liberty that is valuable to be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.242,1271.148,"Well, that is parole once granted."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1283.566,1317.606,"That is right, and I think Your Honor’s question fits in directly with Mr. Justice Stewart’s question concerning whether an applicant for a benefit as opposed to one who retains a benefit is entitled to due process protection, and I believe under the cases of this Court, as well as under the notion that an individual who is not paroled could conceivably be characterized as being deprived of his/her liberty, if parole is not granted as contemplated under the system, that for those reasons, we believe that the application of parole was under due process protection."
1976.74-6438,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.606,1325.374,"Mr. Rivkin, your brief I think includes the statistics on the percentage of applications for parole that are actually granted in Kentucky."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1325.374,1341.163,"That is right, there are 60% of the individuals who are in prison are released on parole and of those 60%, 68% are paroled the first time they appear before the Board, and those are statistics from 72 or 74 approximately."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.163,1341.801,Thank you.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1341.801,1347.762,"With parole viewed in the context above, the nature of the interest at stake becomes apparent."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1395.556,1400.615,"Which hearing are you talking about, the hearing on the ground of the scene or the hearing back at the institution?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1400.615,1407.804,"The hearing back at the institution, the second hearing, the Board first must ascertain certain facts just as it does in parole release."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1431.398,1446.168,"By the time he has last hearing, the time he has the second hearing back at the institution, under Morrissey, he still is in a conditional liberty status, is he not?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1449.279,1453.092,"The prisoner, I believe normally would be incarcerated during that period."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.092,1455.169,It has then not then revoked.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1455.169,1455.545,That is right.
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1455.545,1461.059,"Incarcerated in the same sense, a person is incarcerated when he is arrested before he is charged?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1461.059,1461.567,That is right.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.372,1533.394,"Well, did not Meachum reject the idea that there could be any claim for a hearing in connection with the transfer other than on a statutory basis?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1533.394,1537.754,I think the difference between Meachum and this case is two or three fold.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.375,1559.182,"But it has not said you will be paroled if such and such condition has met, has it?"
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1559.182,1562.199,"No, the State has not said that, but in fact that is what happens."
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.199,1564.862,"Well, but then that is a non-statutory thing."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1564.862,1565.918,It is a practice.
1976.74-6438,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.918,1574.332,"Yeah, but did not Meachum reject the notion that a practice, even if it could be shown with the equivalent of a statutory entitlement."
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1574.332,1576.811,I do not think so Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1639.128,1645.383,You said that even though there is not a explicit statutory provision of a kind as described in my brother Rehnquist’s question there.
1976.74-6438,0,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,1656.166,1656.86,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.872,1669.968,Mr. Kimberlin.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1669.968,1672.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1976.74-6438,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.007,1722.939,How do you knowing that?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1732.523,1733.308,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1733.308,1736.347,"Their occasion to certify it class, although it was requested in the complaint."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1736.347,1737.755,"Yes, Your Honor that is true."
1976.74-6438,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1737.755,1745.223,And how do you explain the Court of Appeals reference to this case as a class action?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1749.043,1755.537,"Well, we do not believe that the reference to it as a class action in effect stable should as a class action, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.537,1756.656,There is no explanation to that.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1758.092,1760.526,"That is correct Your Honor, that is correct."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.496,1775.965,"Mr. Kimberlin, I think the petitioner is still in custody in a legal sense, and that he is on parole now."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1775.965,1777.472,He is on parole now.
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.472,1780.533,Does that mean he is subject to certain restrictions on his conduct?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1780.533,1781.675,"Yes, he is Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.675,1786.809,"Under the Kentucky procedure, may he apply for a change in the present restrictions?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1791.271,1792.595,"Yes, it is possible Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.595,1795.953,Would that be in the nature of a parole release hearing that he made such an application?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1795.953,1802.982,"No, well in a parole release hearing, yes, it would be somewhat similar to that, but not a parole consideration hearing."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.576,1817.424,In a modification he would be entitled to any particular kind of procedure that would be followed in such a request?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1817.424,1825.531,"Well, Your Honor, I do not know exactly what the procedure would be or what he would be entitled to in that type of hearing in which he would ask for modification, I do not know."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.531,1827.614,I see.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1827.614,1844.352,"We do not think that this case falls within the during the old doctrine of a case of a reoccurring nature yet evading review, because it appears to be that this particular doctrine only applies to cases where the same parties once again come into conflict at some subsequent time."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.719,1858.675,What about petitioner’s figure that one-third of them do?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1858.675,1860.325,"Well, that figure of course would --"
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.325,1861.999,That is a pretty good percentage.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1861.999,1866.727,"But that only applies to those who actually do, and I do not believe this Court would have to entertain the presumption."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.159,1874.38,"You assumed that he would, I do not think you have assumed either one, can you?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1874.38,1883.363,"Well, I think there would be a presumption that an individual who has been granted a parole, would you ever think he could to sustain that parole and continue it in order that he may maintain the conditional liberty that at parole reflects."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.363,1886.211,And it also recognizes the fact that one-third do not.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1886.211,1891.871,"One-third do not, one-third do valid approach, yes, Your Honor, that is true."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1911.569,1920.436,"I do not want you to give a legal advice of the petitioner or run a law school or anything, but how could he avail all of this?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1920.436,1921.559,"I am sorry Your Honor, I did not hear you."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.559,1926.729,How could the petitioner in this case evade the situation he is now in?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1926.729,1929.621,You mean in light of the mootness problem here?
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.621,1930.559,Yes.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1930.559,1940.225,It would seem to me that the first thing to then is to try and attempt in every possible way to achieve certification of the class at some point in time prior to the case reaching this stage in the litigation.
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.192,1963.009,"I thought, I limited to this case, what could he have done in this case, where he had two people, he asked class action, the judge ignored it, what could he have done?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1963.009,1967.646,"It is a possibility, he could have asked for class action in United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.145,1971.341,And the thought this is that is what?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1971.341,1974.091,"Well, I would say there is only a possibility Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.263,1978.553,Do you know of any case?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1978.553,1981.102,"No, Your Honor I do not."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.102,1983.38,So I guess he is just stuck.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1988.911,2002.425,"Well, Your Honor he came up for second parole consideration hearing as a matter of course at which time he was granted the parole, which he desired and that happened just prior to certification being to the petition for Writ of Certiorari being valid in this case."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.425,2007.922,It seems to me that your suggestion is that he could have asked the Court of Appeals?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2007.922,2021.285,"Well, there are any number of cases that have been before this Court Your Honor where individuals, whatever action was coming against them, they considered adversely for which they were seeking protection or relief no longer existed or they themselves were no longer in preview."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.285,2023.781,"The case is not against him, it is his case."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2023.781,2024.424,Yes Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.424,2029.084,"Well, of course petitioner has gotten everything he wants, I mean, he has gotten parole."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2037.407,2045.044,"Well, that certainly is correct Justice Rehnquist because after all he has in fact being granted the parole, and that is why we feel he no longer has any personal interests at stake."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.044,2047.296,Then the class action is just out.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2047.296,2049.509,"We believe it is out, we do not believe it can survive."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.509,2052.301,And you do not know of any way to keep it in.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2052.301,2053.224,"No, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.224,2063.659,And you do not know of any way that a group of prisoners who want this done can get relief other than all of them joining as petitioner.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2063.659,2069.744,"If I were counsel, I would had seen to it that very many of them would have joined as plaintiffs together."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2069.744,2073.679,Your answer is the only way to join in lawsuit.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2073.679,2074.708,"Yes, Your Honor that is true."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.708,2077.909,So that is the end of class action in this field.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2077.909,2080.063,"So it has to, in any class action?"
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2080.063,2091.703,"As a class action in prisoner cases, where they can be paroled, there is no way for class action."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2091.703,2098.153,"Well, the District Judge would have granted a class action that would resolve the problem. There have been cases in other Circuits where the judge has granted class action."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.153,2103.864,"Where a District Judge refuses to certify a class, there is no possibility of a class action."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2103.864,2109.891,"I do not know, but that is true Your Honor, that may be, but I do not know."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.891,2116.372,I am back to Justice Rehnquist question about the petitioner having been granted all the relief he sought.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2123.306,2124.245,"Yes, Your Honor that is true."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.245,2138.465,"And if he should prevail in the litigation, is it completely unconceivable that there might be some remedy for the failure to grant the hearing when he says he was constitutionally entitled for hearing for his damages or his statements or reasons for the first time, is that unconceivable?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2138.465,2141.075,"Yes, Your Honor that is true, that is a possibility."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.075,2150.373,Then how come the case be moved?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2150.373,2155.919,Maybe you have me there.
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.516,2167.759,But he is seeking relief in a Federal Court now for that very reason?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2167.759,2179.493,"Well, for the same reasons, although he has been extended relief, we do not believe that he has an extended parole, that he is entitled to any relief now because we do not feel he has any personal interest at stake."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.493,2182.267,But he did not get the parole the first time he asked for it?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2182.267,2183.393,"No, he did not, Your Honor, That is true."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.393,2185.63,He served some time in jail as a result of that.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2185.63,2193.601,"Yes sir, but that would lead us then to the very basic nature of the case itself in parole consideration, which I think I shall now address myself to that ---"
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.601,2194.478,"Of course, you do that."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2194.478,2195.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.523,2205.981,"Any idea that there is some retroactive possible kind of relief presupposes the answers of the question presented by the entire case, does it not?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2205.981,2210.777,"Yes, Your Honor this is why I think I perhaps now should address myself to the very essence of the case on the merits."
1976.74-6438,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.777,2213.14,Did they complaint or asked for the damages?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2213.14,2223.719,"No Your Honor he did not ask for damages, and in fact I do not believe that perusal of the complaint will even reveal that the petitioner himself ever alleged that he was entitled to be paroled at that first hearing."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.719,2234.544,The last paragraph for relief is the plaintiffs be awarded any and all other relief to which they or the members of their class may appear to be entitled under that prayer a judge would have the power to grant broader relief.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2234.544,2236.571,"That would be a possibility, although he did not succeed if we were prosecuting --"
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.571,2241.278,"When we talk about mootness, we are talking about the power of the District Court, not the form of the pleading, are we not?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2241.278,2243.364,Yes Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.364,2251.086,Was that your understanding that the Court could have award damages without a specific added prayer for damages?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2251.086,2255.102,"No, Your Honor, I believe you grant specifically request damages, it is a possibility."
1976.74-6438,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.102,2257.754,That was my thought.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2257.754,2269.161,"We would now turn to the primary issue on the merits, which is whether the due process calls does in fact attach two parole consideration hearings in Kentucky and it is the belief of the respondents that it does not."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.406,2343.023,"General Kimberlin, let me put a hypothetic case to you."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2377.598,2380.83,"Well now, we are dealing with a judge type situation."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.83,2387.242,"That is the first question, as soon as you answer that I am going to ask the case of any different, if the power were given to a Parole Board instead of a judge."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2387.242,2396.127,"I think it would be different than from the situation we have here, in that the sentencing process has ended once in parole, when the person has left the state trial court level."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.127,2421.576,"Well, their argument of course is that as a practical matter, the sentencing process really has not ended, that is why I am trying to put the hypothetical case where the statute had made it perfectly clear that the decision on how long the man would be incarcerated would be made by a judge after a third of the statutory period had already been served and the judge would then have absolute discretion either to prolong the period of incarceration or to release the man."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2424.63,2426.889,"Well, perhaps it is not different from the situation."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.889,2431.458,"Well, then if that is not different, would the Due Process Clause apply to such a hearing?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2434.418,2446.071,I think perhaps it would not apply in that kind of situation coming before judge who has complete discretion upon a statutory entitlement that a person be considered after he serves a certain amount of time of the sentence.
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.071,2452.612,So the key to your position really is the totality of the discretion invested in the Parole Board or the sentencing judge?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2452.612,2455.347,I think the key to our position here is what is his interest here?
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.667,2481.376,I think that his position is that it is a liberty interest because the question to be decided is how long shall a man stay in jail?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2481.376,2485.882,"Well, that is an expectation and so far as the petitioner himself is concerned, he hopes to be released."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.976,2493.169,That seems to be one of the 60% instead of one of the 40%.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2493.169,2509.609,"Well, I do not know exactly what the statistics will mean because in statistics, we are looking at the end result and in order to build up those statistics to begin with, the Parole Board had to consider each case on a case-to-case basis and a parole consideration itself reflects a very individualistic treatment of each person."
1976.74-6438,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.423,2542.516,Actually deprived of it.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2542.516,2545.171,"Exactly, he has to be deprived of it."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2609.743,2611.836,Mr. Kimberlin I have another point.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2617.742,2622.77,I am not exactly sure what that would mean other than the fact but talking with all respondents.
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.77,2628.478,"I mean does he has to go to the prison everyday or you spend nights there, but what is the…"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2628.478,2634.951,I do not know that it is necessary to know what exactly what “close supervision” would be because this is the status somebody whould have who is on parole.
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.951,2650.944,You say that this case has moot because the man is out on parole under “close supervision” and you tell me that I do not need to know what “close supervision” is?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2650.944,2666.068,"Well, we have talked to our clients about “close supervision” about the aspects of this case in the individual characteristics of Scott and “close supervision” would be checking him with parole officers being limited in where he could go and that sort of thing, but no we do not know."
1976.74-6438,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.92,2678.635,Petitioner would put it in the record in this case as to the nature of the…
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2678.635,2679.948,Of “close supervision” Your Honor?
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.769,2683.882,"Well, whose job is it on this mootness point?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2686.386,2688.63,"Well, I believe it is not my job."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.63,2697.514,"Well, if he has to report to the prison three days a week, and spends two days in the prison, would you say the case was moot?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2697.514,2700.781,"Yes, Your Honor because those kinds of considerations deal specifically with the possible."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2700.781,2707.748,"If he was released on parole one hour a week, would you say this case was moot?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2707.748,2713.528,"I do not think that those considerations would be relevant to the consideration of mootness to determination of mootness, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.528,2717.244,"Well, what makes it moot, is that (Inaudible)."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2717.244,2718.056,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2718.056,2724.724,"Well, I am saying if he is not really out, it would not be moot, would it?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2724.724,2727.172,If he were actually back in the prison again?
1976.74-6438,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.172,2733.015,If he was not actually out which is just as clear to me as “close supervision.”
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2733.015,2736.5,"Anyone who is on parole, there is always some limitations."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.302,2763.266,General Kimberlin that is the very point.
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2769.609,2770.288,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.691,2782.23,"Well, let me just interrupt you."
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2787.422,2795.779,"Well, I think it was a rule of court in the tax case because it would be the Court of Tax Appeals that would be in charge of permitting people to come before you."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.779,2802.598,Did not the rule and the tax case specifically provide that the Board had absolute discretion to turn the man down?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2802.598,2826.988,"Well, it may have been Your Honor, but now if someone in that Goldberg case, if an individual fell within the class that would be entitled to become a member of the Tax Court Bar then he could not be denied relief without due process being accorded I believe."
1976.74-6438,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.025,2863.859,Did you read the Goldsmith case is indicating that any lawyer in any accountant was entitled to be admitted to practice?
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,2863.859,2865.776,"No, Your Honor."
1976.74-6438,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3079.839,3093.425,"Mr. Attorney General, suppose no hearing were accorded to prison inmate at all and the Board denied parole without any hearing, what recourse, if any would the prisoner have?"
1976.74-6438,1,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3093.425,3095.98,"Well, he has an entitlement."
1976.74-6438,2,21458,dean_hill_rivkin,,3154.489,3156.166,Just a few points Your Honor.
1976.74-6438,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.037,3261.585,Thank you gentlemen.
