1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.238,We will argument next in Singleton against Wulff 1393.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,46.238,49.182,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.551,358.511,Mr. Boicourt does the record show whether or not the payments in question would have gone to the patient and then to the doctor or would have gone directly to the doctor?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,358.511,368.055,"As I understand the system, Mr. Justice Rehnquist the patient makes application for the Medicaid benefit payments, since that in to the state."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,445.557,450.64,(Inaudible) the oral argument to these issues?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,450.64,462.587,"In the Eighth Circuit, your Honor, the petitioner did not brief or discuss the merits below, believing that it was appealed solely from an order dismissing for lack of standing."
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.937,496.975,"Or are you under some notice though I take it that, since they were the appellant, that they were at least urging the unconstitutionality of the statute before the Eighth Circuit?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,496.975,502.74,We certainly got their brief first and they did brief the constitutionality of statute.
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.894,640.126,"Do the doctors not make any claim that they would have gotten money through this plan, if the section which they claim was unconstitutional, were stricken and that they did not get the money without it?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,640.126,662.78,"The actual claim in their complaint, your honor, was that they did not know what the interpretation of the section was and therefore they were deterred in the practice of Medicine not knowing whether they may or they may not paid by state of Missouri for abortions performed on eligible welfare recipients."
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.78,665.172,"(Inaudible) they were to be paid, they would have done --"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,665.172,682.991,"Certainly, the inference is made in their complaint that they would be ultimate source of welfare moneys paid out by the state of Missouri but for the existence of the statute."
1975.74-1393,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,921.029,929.639,"If you prevail here what is likely to happen, to be back and start all over again with proper plan?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,929.639,941.953,Well that will up to the people who are pushing a particular legislation or I think it is likely that they will seek out plaintiffs who are proper parties to litigate the constitutionality of the statue.
1975.74-1393,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,941.953,946.774,What would you gain with that in the long run?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,946.774,954.861,"Well, for one thing what we really want to gain, that comes up on the second issue we want to have hearing on constitutionality of the statute."
1975.74-1393,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,969.04,976.718,(Inaudible) just as much of a crusading type law suit if you have a female patient plaintiff in addition to the doctors?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,976.718,977.9,"Well, crusading to--"
1975.74-1393,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,977.9,980.089,…or that accusation for?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,980.089,1001.691,"To that extent your Honor but if the state is to be and we are constantly subjected to law suits in order to keep this to a reasonable minimum, I think that the Federal Court should require that the people bring those law suits, satisfy the traditional standing requirements of Article 3 of the Federal constitution."
1975.74-1393,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1001.691,1006.664,But my question was premised on the event of you prevailing here.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1010.621,1030.483,"Well, again Your Honor, it probably not as much of existence of what we gain in this particular case, is that the principle that stands for that if the state is to be sued in Federal Courts, the proper parties only would be ones who would be entertained."
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.483,1035.326,"I would like you to pause for a moment, would you help me on procedure here again I know you covered it I am a little bit lost?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1035.326,1035.518,"Yes, Sir."
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.518,1038.704,What exactly is the posture counts one and three?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1038.704,1043.701,Counts one and three were also dismissed but were are not appealed.
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.701,1044.367,Were not appealed…
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1044.367,1049.955,And the petitioner in this case was not the defendant with regard the counts one and three.
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.955,1055.776,"That is as to the standing question there, it would appear to have been standing for the doctors in those counts, I take I that you would have--"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1055.776,1059.639,"They were dismissed on other grounds, lack of case or controversy in both cases."
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.639,1065.288,"I see, thank you."
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1065.288,1094.317,"Both Federal Medicaid laws in Missouri state statutes are designed to afford optimum relief to eligible persons whose applications for Medicaid assistance is denied or is agreed or whose interest in their application of Medicaid’s assistance are agreed in that interest because the statutory framework provides that they have a right to seek a hearing, specifically provides that."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.29,1280.237,"District Court saw an un-constitutional question, is it?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1280.237,1290.169,"No, I do not think that is clear at all your honor, the District Court in fact impaneled the three-judge court, that it found no substantial constitutional question, one judge could have taken care of the matter."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.169,1292.296,(Voice overlap)
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1292.296,1294.606,If the Judge who impaneled the three-judge Court --
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.606,1300.597,(Voice overlap) the Court of Appeals if they decided the case on the constitutional ground.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1300.597,1302.726,Would not have got to the Court of Appeals in that case --
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1302.726,1304.822,I beg your pardon.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1304.822,1308.145,"Excuse me, would you please repeat the question Mr. Chief Justice?"
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.145,1312.987,"When the case first went in to the District Court, it went to a three-judge Court, did it not?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1312.987,1314.136,"Yes, your honor."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.136,1316.449,And then what did the three-judge Court do?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1316.449,1320.437,They dismissed for lack of standing.
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1320.437,1327.29,Then that was essentially the same as the action of single District Judge was it s not?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1327.29,1329.967,"Under Gonzales, it certainly was Your Honor."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.967,1335.651,"So, otherwise it could not have gone to the Court of Appeals in this posture could it?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1335.651,1339.438,That is correct.
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1339.438,1349.085,Then you pointed that the Court of Appeals immediately took on the constitutional question which the District Court did not reach?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1349.085,1351.665,"Yes, Your Honor, of course, I think --"
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1351.665,1361.687,"But do you think their proper procedure should have been on that issue, if they were going to be decided to send it back to the three-judge Court to reach constitutional issue?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1361.687,1362.09,"Yes, your honor."
1975.74-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.12,1374.882,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1374.882,1376.066,"No, your honor."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.066,1378.038,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1378.038,1380.624,"No, I am not giving up a standing point."
1975.74-1393,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.891,1614.498,"Do you think that under limited grant, limited the question one and two, the issue of the correctness of the constitutional termination is before us?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1614.498,1616.73,"To this extent, your honor—"
1975.74-1393,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1616.73,1627.637,"What I am trying to get at, may we reach and pass upon whether the Court of Appeals correctly decided the constitutional question?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1627.637,1641.692,"No, your honor I do not think you can reach that, I think it becomes relevant because respondents are alleging that the constitutional issue is so clear, so clearly settled by the Federal Courts that there is no reason."
1975.74-1393,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1641.692,1647.027,We would disagree with the conclusion on the constitutional question.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1655.274,1660.116,"Yes, your honor, under the statutory scheme set up a Congress, I do think that is the case."
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.116,1672.027,"Actually if you had sought to challenge the constitutional ruling of Court of Appeals you would have come here by appeal and not by certiorari, would you not have?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1672.027,1695.913,"As I understood the statute your honor, either one would have been acceptable, that although I could have raised the certiorari or appeal to constitutional questions but on appeal, I could not have raised questions who are not of a constitutional magnitude and other questions in regard to standing and their jurisdictional writ to merits that I was not sure about what the court would say in regard to the recent constitutional magnitude."
1975.74-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.913,1716.336,"So really the effect of the Eighth Circuits passing on the constitutional question here is that if they decided adversely to the state, the state can come here on appeal but if they decided in favor of the state, the original plaintiffs can come here only on certiorari?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1716.336,1719.437,That is correct.
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.437,1726.721,"(Inaudible) it did not issue declaratory judgment, it did not issue anything did it not?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1726.721,1729.58,The Court of Appeals declared a statute to be unconstitutional --
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.58,1734.113,"It said so in its opinion, it did not issue one, because the judgment is substantive?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1734.113,1735.531,No your honor and it did not--
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1735.531,1740.72,Is anything different from the opinion filed?
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1747.167,1768.547,"That is true your honor, but I do not think that we should allow the Court of Appeals merely by not saying in it is opinion we hereby enjoin the state to avoid the clear legal rule that they have only appellate jurisdiction because certainly the state is going to abide by a ruling in the constitutionality of the statutes."
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.547,1772.951,"As I remember they said in their opinion that they expected you to abide by, did they not?"
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1772.951,1773.69,They certainly did.
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.69,1774.557,That is right.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1774.557,1775.124,And I do not-
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.124,1785.925,I do not quarrel with that but I mean it is so strange for them to take an action which if they were District Court they would have had the issue of injunction or declaratory judgment.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1791.877,1792.962,"Exactly, your honor."
1975.74-1393,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.962,1800.517,I am confused.
1975.74-1393,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1800.517,1809.406,"This Court has never decided and had not decided at the time, the Eighth Circuit rendered its opinion."
1975.74-1393,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.051,1833.661,Mr. Susman.
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1833.661,1838.188,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-1393,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.873,1857.743,This is jurisdictional question.
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1865.325,1886.119,"We agree with the petitioner that the hornbook type of black letter law is clearly that issues not decided below, will not be decided on appeal and yet as we attempt to point out in our brief, there are exceptions which have been accepted by every Circuit to this general black letter rule."
1975.74-1393,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.119,1890.39,(Inaudible).
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1898.817,1906.211,"Well, the three-judge Federal statutes would appear to give the jurisdiction solely to the three-judge District Court panel."
1975.74-1393,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1909.133,1910.454,Do you say it would appear to?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1910.454,1911.399,Right.
1975.74-1393,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.102,1943.107,Does the judge on the on the Court of Appeals panel?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1943.107,1944.217,"No, there certainly was not."
1975.74-1393,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.217,1948.143,"So, it did not, it was not even a de facto of three-judge District Court, was it?"
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1948.143,1949.064,"No, it was not."
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.068,1964.935,"But in most cases, can the other party give the right to answer?"
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1964.935,1965.569,"Yes, in this—"
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.569,1966.747,In most cases?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1966.747,1967.418,That is correct.
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.418,1970.048,"Then, they did not have right answer here?"
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,1970.048,1993.681,"There was no answer filed by petitioner in this case at any stage of the proceedings, although we cite in our briefs, several other cases in which Court of Appeals also rule on the merits in which the one side of the other, the defendants below at least had never filed an answer because filing an answer could in no way contribute it to the case because the issue was so clear."
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.555,2001.507,"The Federal government, I guess we get to the point eventually where the court could just read statute and declare it unconstitutional?"
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2001.507,2005.508,The Court of Appeals in this case did issue a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional.
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.508,2008.176,Where is the judgment?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2008.176,2012.335,In the last if this is maybe consider the judgment in the last para --
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.335,2013.877,The last paragraph of opinion?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2013.877,2014.276,That is correct.
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.276,2016.445,It is not a judgment?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2016.445,2018.042,No that is all that they said they did not—
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.042,2020.032,It is all they said?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2024.748,2027.917,"That is correct, they did not issue an injunction."
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.917,2031.454,"It is kind of peculiar, is it not?"
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2031.454,2038.983,It was difficult to find cases on either side of this issue on the second point.
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.642,2046.565,(Inaudible) that your client’s is suing on behalf of “their patients”?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2046.565,2048.197,That is correct.
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2048.197,2051.096,And we do not know if they have got patients in that too?
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2051.096,2056.094,"Well, they state in their verified complaint that they do have patients, they have not refused patients."
1975.74-1393,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.379,2078.371,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1393,1,24566,frank_susman,,2078.371,2079.473,"No, that is not all."
