2003.02-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,1.365,Ms. Zinn.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,1.365,5.451,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,35.256,38.349,May I ask on... on the first point?
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,53.493,54.575,"No, it's not immaterial."
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.512,61.917,No.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,90.203,92.599,--Unrepresented by the State Attorney General.
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.599,93.425,Unrepresented.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,116.998,120.257,"Fact and a matter of law, Your Honor."
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.747,136.438,"No, but that... but that's a waiver theory."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,160.919,179.328,"--Under our second argument, our position is that since the decree is a remedy ordered in a valid Ex Parte Young case, it provides prospective relief only from alleged ongoing violations of Federal law."
2003.02-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.755,186.387,And therefore it's consistent with the Eleventh Amendment without any waiver.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,186.387,187.585,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,189.897,191.755,Can you tell us how it worked?
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,209.588,210.869,--In... in this case--
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.869,215.737,--And let... let me just say also there's no excerpt of record or docket entry.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,224.737,226.511,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.226,249.174,And--
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,253.965,254.458,That's correct.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.458,254.997,--that's it.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,254.997,255.619,That's correct.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.619,256.072,Okay.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,268.538,269.858,The same parties--
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,269.858,273.573,Wearing different... wearing different hats or proceeding under some different theory.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,273.573,280.055,--The same parties were before the Court for the entire case with the exception of two State agencies which were dismissed early on.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.055,280.426,Right.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,308.95,310.353,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.783,335.04,"The State, if... if I remember correctly, came before the judge and urged the approval of this consent decree."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,335.04,335.595,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.595,336.05,Did it not?
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,340.962,342.077,"Correct, and they were unanimous."
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.334,351.736,That... that's your waiver.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,353.511,353.799,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.799,373.756,"I frankly am reluctant to... to decide the case on that ground if another ground is available simply because that would require a case-by-case investigation as to... to what extent the participation by... by other State officials existed, whether they were authorized to participate and so forth and so on."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,383.771,389.853,In our... in our view both positions are clear in this case.
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.117,400.201,You have to make sure that the State Attorney General was authorized to represent the State in this case or whatever other official you say committed the waiver.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,404.326,405.252,--No.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,410.52,413.409,"No, but Justice Scalia's question didn't go to waiver."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,420.467,428.846,"--But in Lapides, it appeared to me that that was resolved fairly simply based on the application of Federal law to the State--"
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,428.846,431.158,Once... once it was understood that he could represent.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,431.158,437.103,"--Yes, which was determined by an examination of the State statutes involved."
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,444.162,444.716,"Oh, sure."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,450.023,451.22,--But--
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.22,455.224,"This case might not be difficult, but I... I don't like going rummaging around in State law."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,458.158,459.189,"--I do too, Your Honor."
2003.02-628,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,459.189,467.463,"Ms. Zinn, I thought that you said in response to my question that this... this waiver... that's not your preferred ground."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,489.282,490.785,That's correct.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.804,520.116,Let's put... put it this way.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,532.023,533.409,--Yes.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.409,537.002,"--rules, that then there must be a waiver?"
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,537.002,542.325,No.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,542.325,543.234,All right.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,544.637,545.669,Well--
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.669,547.981,Especially if they've asserted their immunity at the beginning.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,547.981,560.78,"--Because under this Court's traditional rules concerning equitable decrees, even a disputed injunction need not be specifically tied to the provisions of law for the--"
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,560.78,580.675,"So you want us to write an opinion that says after the State has specifically asserted its Eleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a consent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of jurisdiction set forth in... in Ex Parte Young without waiver."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,580.675,588.765,--The question of the scope of remedy is a different question from the Eleventh Amendment/Ex Parte Young question.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.709,596.939,"Well... well, you introduced the point of remedy."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,623.195,626.91,"--For example, damages?"
2003.02-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.316,647.631,"You... you really can't tell until the decree is entered whether or not it complied with Ex Parte Young, I would think, because it isn't necessarily fought out on the... in the... in the trial of the case exactly what the remedy will be."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,647.631,660.634,"The... the validity of consent decree should be... as in an Ex Parte Young case, should be measured under this... this Court's decision, for example, in Milliken and Rufo."
2003.02-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.412,678.839,But maybe... maybe there should be a special rule for Ex Parte Young cases.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,708.023,715.082,"--Milliken involved a State official, and it's one of the key cases about the scope of disputed injunctions."
2003.02-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.164,727.879,Is this outside of Ex Parte Young?
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,752.195,752.605,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.605,759.914,"And now you get that injunction, and that injunction contains provisions that aren't all about Federal law."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,784.927,785.836,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.836,789.469,Ex Parte Young authorizes such a thing.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,789.469,790.5,Correct.
2003.02-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.5,791.948,"Now, is that last statement right?"
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,791.948,792.691,Yes.
2003.02-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.691,795.458,So then it's not outside Ex Parte Young.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,799.007,800.287,Yes.
2003.02-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.287,808.545,And what is your authority for saying that Ex Parte Young validates the going beyond the Federal issues involved?
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,813.125,814.034,Milliken.
2003.02-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.481,831.002,"Well, I'm not talking so much about enforcement as about entering it in the first place consistently with Ex Parte Young."
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,831.002,869.185,"Well, this Court's decision in Firefighters generally sets out standards for entry of a consent decree, and a decree is properly entered, as this one was found to be, if it furthers... if it serves to resolve a dispute within the court's subject matter jurisdiction, which is the case here... this is a Federal question about the Medicaid Act... if it is generally within the scope of the pleadings, which is true in this case, and if the remedy in the decree serves to further the objectives of the... in this case, the Medicaid Act, which is true about all of the provisions of the decree in this case."
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.185,872.779,So you're really saying that it doesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,879.671,880.868,That's correct.
2003.02-628,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.014,892.84,When you had--
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,937.635,940.502,"Well, I'd hate to put words into Mr. Cruz's mouth."
2003.02-628,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.502,940.978,I know.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,941.638,943.662,But I believe that is part of their claim.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,943.662,944.489,--Okay.
2003.02-628,0,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,944.489,945.436,May I reserve the rest of my time?
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,950.145,960.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.719,1049.007,Suppose the Attorney General had not been involved and simply the State officials on their own entered into this consent decree.
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1049.007,1065.976,"First of all, you would have the question of waiver, and that is answered by the inquiry that Lapides and other waiver cases have... have instructed, which is do those... are those officials authorized by State law to conduct litigation on behalf of the State."
2003.02-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1065.976,1070.267,So that would be a factual inquiry in every case whether the particular official--
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1070.267,1072.375,"Well, I would say... I would say it's a legal question--"
2003.02-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.375,1073.156,--I understand.
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1073.156,1081.412,"--that typically in almost every State, Justice Scalia, it would be the Attorney General who is authorized to represent the State in litigation."
2003.02-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1081.412,1084.096,"Well, Justice Scalia can preserve his own hypothetical."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1084.096,1084.468,Right.
2003.02-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.468,1093.179,"But suppose that there was... that the officials did not have the authority to waive the Eleventh Amendment, but they did enter into a consent decree."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1093.179,1093.567,Yes.
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.671,1135.449,"This... this carries you so far beyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex Parte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign immunity when you are simply requiring State officials to adhere to State law."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1174.747,1191.837,"--In an Ex Parte Young action, State officials like all other Federal litigants are free to enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is strictly required by Federal law on one or more issues because there is a tradeoff."
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.326,1207.441,I'm not worried about the officials.
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1232.599,1242.242,"First of all, we... we presume... this Court presumes that State officials, when they act in their official capacity, are acting in good faith to implement the best interests of the State."
2003.02-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1248.846,1254.335,"Mr. Gornstein, is... is taking the Attorney General out of it kind of a hypothetical question?"
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1262.88,1281.002,"--I don't know of any such case, and as I was telling Justice Scalia before, all the Court's waiver cases up until now have been ones in which the Attorney General has represented the State and has waived the... has... has been authorized by the State to represent the State's interests in litigation."
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.002,1300.776,"Might be improper for... for the... for the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with Federal law, to... to approve a consent decree that goes beyond that without the presence of the... I mean, maybe waiver is a necessary concomitant of... of the theory of Ex Parte Young that you're giving us."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1300.776,1308.123,"No, I don't think it... it is a necessary... waiver is not a necessary concomitant because it is a component of an Ex Parte Young case."
2003.02-628,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.921,1326.039,"Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what you mean in your argument when you say go beyond."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1380.259,1381.562,"Yes, but let... let me explain further."
2003.02-628,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.562,1382.388,I guess my question is--
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1382.388,1383.065,Yes.
2003.02-628,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1383.065,1387.051,"--why do you acquiesce in this phrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young?"
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1387.96,1388.416,"No, I--"
2003.02-628,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.416,1392.047,"--Has anybody seen a consent decree that simply said, we'll obey the law?"
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1392.047,1392.707,--No.
2003.02-628,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1409.304,1409.759,That's all--
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1409.759,1414.3,And Milliken permits that as long as it's aimed at remedying a violation.
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.393,1445.796,--You should have given a different answer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric podiatry would further the objectives of the law to provide the medical care to... to children.
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1445.796,1463.257,"Well, at some point it has to resolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter jurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no arguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates to, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as a decree under Rufo."
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.257,1465.365,"Well, you really haven't saved us a whole lot of trouble then."
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1487.945,1497.809,"In general, once a decree has been entered, there's no objection that can be made at the enforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction."
2003.02-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.688,1547.304,The Attorney General was involved in the case in Rufo.
2003.02-628,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1549.04,1549.328,"No, no."
2003.02-628,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.434,1567.532,"--Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1569.595,1574.962,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.572,1617.232,But can I ask you this question?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1623.631,1627.718,It does not necessarily mean that and no court has determined that.
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.718,1634.405,"No, but isn't it... isn't the... in order to determine the court's power to act, don't you have to look at the facts at the time litigation started?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1634.405,1641.176,"Well, under Ex Parte Young, the question is not retrospectively was there a violation of Federal law, but... but--"
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.176,1641.714,No.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1647.659,1656.325,"--There is a strong argument that there was not a violation of Federal law at the time the litigation commenced, but that matter was never adjudicated one way or the other."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.325,1659.669,"That's right because the State, in effect, waived its right to adjudicate that."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1659.669,1665.696,What the State did is pursue an option to settle the... the matter and avoid an adjudication.
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.696,1683.529,"But doesn't that mean there was at least a potential violation of law that would give the court jurisdiction to enter a remedy, which might go beyond merely saying, don't violate the law in the future, that because you may have violated the law in the past, I have the power to order you to do some things that may not in themselves be illegal?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1683.529,1694.265,"We would agree that this case was initially properly brought under Ex Parte Young in that the complaint, under the terms of the Verizon decision, alleged a violation of Federal law."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.709,1723.26,"Well, do you think in order to enter a consent decree, the judge had to adjudicate that there was a violation of Federal law?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1723.26,1724.396,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.266,1758.826,"So you're... you're telling us that the effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by it, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's... let's not fight about whether there was a violation or not, we'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this consent decree is simply we'll fight about this same question later."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1759.857,1761.548,If the agreement was--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.548,1762.746,And you haven't given up anything else.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1769.144,1769.887,--Well--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.887,1775.173,"You're just telling them, you know, just dismiss this case, and if you want to get us, bring the same case later."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1777.335,1780.578,--The consent decree offered the other side a great deal.
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.38,1795.811,"Only so long as the State chose to do it because on your theory, you... you create this oddity."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1838.824,1842.168,"--Justice Ginsburg, we're... we're making both distinctions."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1848.65,1849.188,Why?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1852.282,1858.143,--It would be more difficult because you at least had the predicate for Ex Parte Young in the first place.
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.812,1871.889,"Well, but it seems to me that when matters are in doubt and a consent decree is entered, obviously with the consent of both parties... that's what it means... that it is a question of Federal law."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1873.375,1880.684,"It... it is absolutely a Federal judgment, but on the terms of the consent decree, there was no concession of liability."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1886.461,1886.916,No.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1901.118,1903.923,In essence--
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1903.923,1907.555,So we're in... it seems to me you're in the same boat under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1907.555,1921.384,"--The second part of Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical about whether even if this were fully adjudicated, would this content... consent decree be proper, the answer is plainly no because this consent decree does not enjoin ongoing violations of Federal law."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1923.696,1928.61,"So in other... I take that to mean, yes, we would be making exactly the same argument--"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1928.61,1929.103,--Absolutely.
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.103,1930.218,--if this had been a litigated decree.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1931.704,1932.004,Absolutely.
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1932.004,1953.046,"--that the order saying, A, you did something wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the future to avoid that, you've got to do the following things, A, B, C... you would say so long as at the moment of enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in the sense found in the judgment, they cannot order A, B, C, and D."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1953.046,1956.556,"Under Milliken, the question would be the relation--"
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1956.556,1956.928,No.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1960.809,1971.295,"--Our answer is going to be that the... the jurisdiction that this Court has created under Ex Parte Young and its progeny exists for one purpose, to vindicate the Supremacy Clause."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.295,1974.639,"No, but you're... you're getting into... into a general answer, and I want a specific answer."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2002.874,2011.047,"If C and D were necessary to ensure compliance with Federal law, then they would be permissible remedies once there was a finding under Federal law."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.047,2011.436,"Well, all right."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2024.134,2028.054,If there's an ongoing injunction--
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2028.054,2043.203,"We didn't... we didn't appeal saying, look, Supreme Court, they... you know, they... they nailed us to the wall on liability, but they do not have jurisdiction to order A, B, C, and D and E because they don't have jurisdiction to enforce it."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2047.168,2054.681,"--If the injunction is ongoing, then the State officials could come in at any point and say, C, D, and E are not necessary--"
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.681,2057.449,Can I ask you what is the purpose of doing this?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2119.742,2121.805,"--Justice Breyer, two responses."
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.718,2127.089,No.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2127.915,2128.492,--consent decree explicitly--
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.492,2131.426,--That's not answering my question at all.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2133.86,2141.746,--The second response... your... your question refers to volumes of Federal law and State law that may or may not have been violated.
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.513,2145.34,I'm not asking about this case.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2174.811,2183.894,"Justice Breyer, the exercise of requiring a... a violation of Federal law derives from this Court's cases beginning with Ex Parte Young and moving on."
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.894,2185.38,You're saying the cases require it.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2224.267,2232.812,"Justice Breyer, under the Fifth Circuit precedent, the means to challenge this sort of decree is precisely what we did, to challenge it."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.014,2242.1,You mean you can never move for modification prior to an enforcement action?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2242.1,2249.448,"--Well, you can, and that's the second part which is the Fifth Circuit treated what we did as a motion to modify or vacate the decree."
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.642,2256.052,The Fifth Circuit... excuse me.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2300.512,2309.345,--It is true that treating our... our argument as a motion to modify is not purely based upon changed facts and law.
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.237,2333.948,"Why don't you make a virtue of a necessity and say that that is precisely your response to Justice Breyer, that you cannot do what you want to do under rule 60(b)?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2333.948,2335.6,--That--
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.6,2336.343,Why not?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2354.176,2354.63,--My... my--
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.63,2355.169,Right?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2355.169,2355.745,--My hope--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.745,2356.876,So that's your answer to Justice Breyer.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2356.876,2357.519,--My... my hope would be--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.519,2359.543,But that... that leaves you with Justice Ginsburg's problem.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2360.574,2371.887,"--My hope would be to make virtues out of either approach and to say that it could either be done on... under an effort to modify or a challenge of enforcement, that either avenue is available."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.088,2381.379,"Modification doesn't depend on changed circumstances, does it, under that theory?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2385.466,2391.122,"--Well, we don't know what the circumstances were when... when this matter was entered because there was no adjudication on the merits."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.949,2397.809,"Well, but there are allegations of fact that would have... the allegations did allege a... a violation of Federal law, did they not?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2397.809,2411.944,"--If those... they did, and if those allegations were true, then there are changed circumstances because the district court was very clear that there is absolutely no evidence that even a single class member has ever requested services and been denied."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.899,2419.563,"Yes, but that's not an answer to all... the statute requires more than waiting for requests to be made."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2419.563,2424.021,"--But... but that really is the critical dispute because the statute, the Medicaid statute--"
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.021,2431.33,"As I understand the record, you've made marvelous and extensive changes in your practices, and that's why you're in such wonderful shape now."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2434.302,2442.597,"--That's possible, and so this could be fairly characterized as a motion to modify because there is not an ongoing violation of Federal law now."
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.715,2468.315,"Well, but I want to know if you could go... could you go through 60(b)?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2499.44,2502.041,--Yes.
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.041,2502.662,Yes.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2510.852,2513.619,And that's what the Fifth Circuit treated what we did.
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.196,2514.568,All right.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2515.661,2516.22,--We will prevail either way.
2003.02-628,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.22,2520.678,"So if we think you have a right to go in under 60(b), is that the end of the case?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2520.678,2527.199,"If... if what we did is deemed that, because--"
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2527.199,2527.737,Mr. Cruz--
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2538.595,2550.605,--It's not a bit beyond and... and one important caveat of 60(b) is most of this Court's 60(b) cases are in a context where the State or a State official is not a defendant.
2003.02-628,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.605,2555.063,"Well, 60(b) is basically changed circumstances or changed law, isn't it?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2555.063,2555.601,It is.
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.087,2568.604,"But beyond that, Rufo said that when you're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the 60(b) is more flexible than it would be if you were dealing with a private party."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2568.604,2569.431,--It... it did.
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.423,2578.281,"Yes, but we're talking about 60(b)."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2603.627,2616.547,"--We don't necessarily concede that the court should have entered this decree, but the point at which we litigated it is the point at which the Federal court began to exercise coercive authority of a Federal court over the State."
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.033,2623.317,"It didn't exercise authority till the plaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the decree."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2625.342,2626.29,--But--
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.29,2627.571,"You could have said, yes, we are."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2627.571,2628.519,--But what--
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.519,2630.088,You didn't say that.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2630.088,2631.081,--We did say that.
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.775,2662.0,"They gave up their lawsuit, and you're... you're... and you know, packed up and went home, and you're telling them that they... that they accomplished nothing by doing that."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2667.573,2670.007,"Justice Scalia, they accomplished a number of things."
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.406,2677.604,"Well, you can't say it was voluntarily."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2686.808,2691.266,--The State officials endeavored to improve the program--
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2691.266,2693.041,To comply with the decree.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2693.041,2697.311,--But the decree was drafted as an effort to end this... this litigation.
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.311,2704.641,"Yes, but it imposed obligations on the defendants which they had to perform in... to avoid being held in contempt of court."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2704.641,2724.703,"Your Honor, that actually opens the door to yet another reason why we do not believe this Court should hold that Ex Parte Young defendants can engage in commitments that extend far beyond Federal law because that open... opens a Pandora's box to separation of powers problems."
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2724.703,2726.478,It's... it's maybe far beyond.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2744.394,2753.31,"Justice Kennedy, no body of law, Federal or State law, requires virtually everything that's in the consent decree."
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2762.432,2767.716,These are just necessary procedures to implement the program and to make it work well.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2767.716,2769.014,"--I mean, the consent decree--"
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2769.014,2770.5,And they were agreed to you by your client.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2770.5,2777.254,--The consent decree requires that the State officials train private health care workers in cultural sensitivity.
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2784.973,2791.744,"Well, suppose it were shown that the failure to do this caused serious flaws in the implementation of the program."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2791.744,2795.497,--The Federal law requires--
2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.497,2805.861,The court surely has the authority... and the parties certainly have the right... to stipulate to provisions that will make the consent decree effective.

2003.02-628,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2816.924,2818.16,But that's... that's the issue.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2834.673,2835.993,--Justice Scalia--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.993,2846.85,"Why... assuming everything you said is true, that this goes beyond what could have been imposed under Ex Parte Young, nonetheless, you had the State Attorney General who agreed to all of this."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2857.353,2863.751,"--Justice Scalia, the premise of the question that the Attorney General had power to waive sovereign immunity is not correct under Texas law."
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2899.151,2900.637,May I stop you at that point?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2923.466,2935.932,"Justice Ginsburg, your... your hypothetical is in fact the law in the Texas, in that the legislature has explicitly said the Attorney General may not waive sovereign immunity in Government Code 402.004."
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.932,2947.699,"--Then what was the attorney... then the Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal court when the Attorney General said, this is a consent decree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2959.337,2966.768,"Justice Ginsburg, the Attorney General didn't deceive the court because the Attorney General never represented that this was a waiver of sovereign immunity."
2003.02-628,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.108,2988.316,But nothing required the State to agree to this consent decree.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3021.464,3026.582,"--The State acted in an attempt to avoid a long, protracted litigation."
2003.02-628,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.092,3035.87,"In Gunter, the State was also hailed involuntarily before the Federal court."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3035.87,3046.373,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but Gunter was an adjudication on the merits and found an ongoing violation of Federal law and then enjoined that ongoing violation."
2003.02-628,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.783,3053.786,"Well, you prevented it from happening by entering into the consent decree."
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3053.786,3057.23,--But that could have happened at the stage of enforcement.
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.706,3095.563,Are you suggesting they filed a lawsuit they didn't think they could win?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3095.563,3100.143,They filed a lawsuit that was filed before Judge William Wayne Justice--
2003.02-628,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.143,3103.281,"It was filed in good faith alleging violations of Federal law, was it not?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3103.281,3108.938,--It was... it... we presume it was filed in good faith and it alleged violations of Federal law.
2003.02-628,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3118.348,3120.371,Then why enter a consent decree?
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3140.433,3142.868,--It was an effort to end the litigation.
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3147.121,3147.387,No.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3150.63,3162.436,"It is a voluntary agreement and it allows... it agrees that the district court is available, it's familiar with the law and facts and can... the case can be brought back to it if there's ongoing dispute."
2003.02-628,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3162.436,3162.974,Right.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3165.491,3169.761,Or we'll agree to this and that will resolve the matter.
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.154,3189.723,Only with the State Attorney General.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3253.42,3254.096,That--
2003.02-628,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.096,3255.482,But that's not this situation.
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3259.464,3261.88,--But... but that is a fundamental problem with these cases.
2003.02-628,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3350.136,3353.934,"Well, surely they had attorneys, State attorneys, representing them, did they not?"
2003.02-628,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3353.934,3355.875,"--They... they did, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-628,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.879,3379.115,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2003.02-628,3,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,3381.427,3387.66,Some of the arguments made are not tethered in... tethered or tied to the record in this case.
2003.02-628,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.591,3469.827,Would a change in administrations be a change of circumstances that... that justifies 60(b) being invoked?
2003.02-628,3,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,3469.827,3470.432,--No.
2003.02-628,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3473.525,3478.234,"Is there then a way to deal with the problem that Justice Scalia raised, which is a serious problem I think?"
2003.02-628,3,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,3478.234,3481.866,--If a change in... in administrations results in--
2003.02-628,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.866,3495.916,"Well, what they do is they go examine this decree and there all kinds of things in the decree that may be very nice and really helpful to people, but actually the legislature would never pass them, and they have nothing to do with Federal law."
2003.02-628,3,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,3501.472,3502.049,--Yes.
2003.02-628,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3502.049,3504.361,"But it's a known problem, and what's your solution to it?"
2003.02-628,3,42308,susan_finkelstein_zinn,,3504.361,3516.417,"As has been pointed out, Rufo does create a more flexible standard for modification when consent decrees are involved in institutional reform litigation of this type."
2003.02-628,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3544.447,3545.024,"Thank you, Ms. Zinn."
