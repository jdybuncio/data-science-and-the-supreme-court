1988.87-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.366,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-56, Owens and Lessard v. Okure."
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,60.621,64.403,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-56,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,563.199,567.883,What does that have to do with the present time?
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,567.883,582.173,"Well, we think that the analysis of this Court in Wilson was in large measure a historic analysis not totally, but in large measure a historic analysis as which would be the most appropriate statute to use."
1988.87-56,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.127,986.5,"Mr.... Mr. Schiff, it may work well in New York where it's easy enough, as you say, although I guess there's some contest on the point, to pick out what is the... the intentional tort statute."
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1026.715,1038.362,"Well, our position is that the... the line that should be chosen is... is not solely to try to determine whether a statute applies to all intentional torts."
1988.87-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.244,1108.046,xxx that the statute you're referring to covers all intentional torts?
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1108.046,1113.031,"--Well, I think virtually all."
1988.87-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.936,1126.679,And do you think that statute covers only intentional torts?
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1126.679,1127.3,--Which?
1988.87-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.091,1130.372,The one you're... the one you think should apply.
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1131.822,1133.465,"Yes, it only covers intentional torts."
1988.87-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.465,1134.784,--But it doesn't say intentional torts.
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1136.567,1138.257,"It lists... yes, that's right."
1988.87-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.257,1143.69,"And the other... and the other statutes don't say unintentional either, do they?"
1988.87-56,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1143.69,1145.543,"No, no."
1988.87-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.278,1445.7,"Thank you, Mr. Schiff."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1448.292,1464.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.607,1616.501,Do you suppose it might narrow the choice a little bit to say intentional tort is the category you rely on?
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1616.501,1618.342,"--It... it would not, Your Honor."
1988.87-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.342,1618.953,Why not?
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1618.953,1619.744,Because--
1988.87-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.744,1626.199,"Well, it wouldn't... at least it wouldn't be possible to apply statutes of limitations governing unintentional torts."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1626.199,1635.115,"--Well, I... I don't think that that's what will happen because many statutes cover both."
1988.87-56,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.41,1646.072,What if we just said assault and battery?
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1653.885,1666.294,"I... I don't think that would create any problems, but I think that line would be an arbitrary one and not consistent at all with the statutory history of Section 1983."
1988.87-56,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.294,1679.785,"Well, I'm not sure it's any more arbitrary than just the general tort statute if that general tort statute wouldn't be... wouldn't be covering, as it apparently would not in New York, the... the majority of claims that... that 1983 was concerned with."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1679.785,1687.069,That's... I think that's important misconception of what 1983 was concerned about.
1988.87-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.029,1735.189,xxx think Wilson made much sense then.
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1735.189,1736.091,--Excuse me?
1988.87-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.091,1739.381,I wouldn't think you would think that Wilson made much sense.
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1739.381,1740.132,"Oh, absolutely."
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.454,1800.042,"Since... since our decision in Daniels and Davidson, certainly any due process claims sound very much in intent and not in mere negligence."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1800.042,1801.064,--Well--
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.064,1803.695,And those are brought under 1983.
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1803.695,1816.482,"--I... I think that... that when you try to take the word ""intentional tort"" and use that word ""intent"" and apply it in a constitutional context, you have two different words with two different meanings."
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.501,1833.743,"No, but my question to you is about the due process intent, not equal protection."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1833.743,1835.335,"Well, in the substantive due process area--"
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.335,1836.755,But a procedural due process.
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1836.755,1842.231,"--In procedural due process, I don't think that that's the answer and I don't think it has been resolved in... in those two cases."
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.231,1843.68,You don't think what's the answer?
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1843.68,1847.073,That is that... that intent is the... has been determined.
1988.87-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.073,1848.493,"Well, certainly negligence is not there."
1988.87-56,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1848.493,1857.889,I don't think in the area of procedural due process that this Court has determined that intent is an element in the denial--
1988.87-56,2,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2692.563,2701.588,"Unless the Court has further questions, I would only ask the Court to reverse and direct that the complaint be dismissed."
1988.87-56,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.199,2702.94,Very well.
