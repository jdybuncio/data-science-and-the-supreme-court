1982.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.489,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 80 Original, State of Colorado against the State of New Mexico and others."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,27.138,30.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,54.837,58.21,"The important thing, Mr. Simms, of course, is whether we understand it, isn't it?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,58.21,60.491,"--I agree, that is the important thing."
1982.80_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,129.787,131.347,"Mr. Simms, who wrote that?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,131.347,132.679,I don't know who wrote it.
1982.80_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,133.348,135.231,Those are some anonymous author's comments?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,135.231,139.822,--It was written by the editorial staff of the Digest in San Francisco.
1982.80_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.905,148.688,I find it kind of a surprising authority if you don't even know who wrote it.
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,148.688,153.212,"Well, it was written by the editorial staff of the Western Conference of Attorneys General."
1982.80_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,153.212,155.953,I personally find it kind of amazing that you cite it to us.
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,164.589,167.501,"I think the central issues are three, Justice Burger."
1982.80_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.694,422.357,"Mr. Simms, may I ask you whether it's your position that as between two states, both of which are states using the appropriated water theory, that the prior appropriator must make reasonable use of the water that's appropriated?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,433.294,440.998,The court has said that each state is obligated to conserve water to the extent that is economically possible.
1982.80_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.289,492.944,"If the historic use is somehow wasteful, can the Master take that into consideration or not?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,492.944,494.745,"--Oh, I think he definitely can."
1982.80_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.2,591.296,"Would there be any support in the case law, counsel, for requiring, for example, the appropriation user to line ditches with concrete, or anything of that sort?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,591.296,608.687,"No, on the contrary, Justice O'Connor, the cases, and specifically, Nebraska versus Wyoming, indicate that farmers are obliged to be only as efficient as they economically can be efficient."
1982.80_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,633.214,638.427,"Mr. Simms, the Master did find that the operation of that district was inefficient, didn't he?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,638.427,645.272,"He did find... I don't think he found... yes, he did find that it was inefficient."
1982.80_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,645.272,651.347,"And he also found, as I recall, that there was a loss of about 33 percent of the water."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,658.821,668.849,What the Master found was that 33 percent of the water diverted was lost in the application of water in the Vermejo Conservancy District.
1982.80_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,730.558,740.984,"Which case, if I may interrupt you, among the eight that have addressed generally this area, discusses the efficiency question you are now discussing?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,740.984,746.898,"--Wyoming versus Colorado, Colorado versus Kansas, Nebraska versus Wyoming."
1982.80_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,746.898,748.751,Which supports you?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,749.83,751.743,All three of those cases support us.
1982.80_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.923,793.931,"Am I correct in thinking that, if I read page 21 of the Master's report correctly, that he said there that if you apply the rule of prior appropriation in this case, it would prevent any diversion to Colorado."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,820.418,822.729,"I think not at all, in response."
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.349,904.945,"Mr. Simms, what's your benchmark for appropriation?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,908.545,912.359,It is not necessarily decreed rights.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.54,915.26,"Well, what about this case?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,949.923,955.607,--If there were enough water in the river to satisfy the average annual use... if you want to put it that way.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.954,994.794,"Well, in this case suppose our view of the record was that there was water left over in the river after satisfying the average historic use, as you put it, of the New Mexico users."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,994.794,997.866,I think it would be extremely difficult to reach that view.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.266,1000.998,"I know, but suppose."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1005.921,1009.864,"--If your facts are right, there would be water available for Colorado."
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.302,1025.405,"I know, but you mean a fully decreed river."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1025.405,1026.745,"--No, fully appropriated river."
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.745,1038.913,You say there's absolutely no water left over in the river after you satisfy the average historic uses of it.
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1038.913,1042.976,The decreed rights is an example for the Vermejo Conservancy District.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.719,1084.543,Do we have to decide this case properly... do we have to decide whether the Master was incorrect in doing that?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1084.543,1089.967,I think it's important that you do understand that the Master was incorrect in doing that.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.967,1091.226,Is that a factfinding?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1091.226,1096.572,"I think it is a factfinding, but it is spoiled by two problems--"
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.572,1100.453,So we have to overturn the Master in this respect to come out on your side?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1100.453,1103.785,"--In that respect, but not to come out on our side in general, no."
1982.80_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.727,1495.513,"When you talk about the water getting down past the Vermejo diversion point, that's because of what you referred to as inefficiency?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1495.513,1498.425,"No, it is not inefficiency at all."
1982.80_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.425,1500.126,What is it?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1508.5,1511.442,"Except in periods of flood, that is the case."
1982.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.638,1567.73,"What happens, Mr. Simms,... let me give you this hypothetical."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1602.093,1604.354,"No, it is not a rigid doctrine."
1982.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.232,1614.9,Existing when?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1616.232,1618.293,Existing at the time of the lawsuit.
1982.80_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.456,1647.822,"Well, isn't the supplying of domestic water given priority in most western states as opposed to use for irrigation or manufacturing?"
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1647.822,1651.405,It is given priority as a preference for it in the state of Colorado.
1982.80_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.679,1662.572,"At any rate, Colorado Fuel and Iron wasn't contemplating giving drinking water to a lot of people by its use, I take it."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1662.572,1672.408,"No, they're contemplating taking water out of the Vermejo River and putting it in the Purgatoire system on the theory that there is need in the Purgatoire system."
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.408,1673.67,For what?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1678.673,1679.772,That's a good question.
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.675,1683.095,"It isn't in the record, anyway."
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1683.095,1689.77,"Water Division 2 thought the uses were so speculative, he also threw it out for that reason, to begin with when he went."
1982.80_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.072,1695.023,Is there any evidence in this case about it?
1982.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,1696.185,1696.755,--Yes.
1982.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.71,1723.493,"Very well, Mr. Simms."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1730.088,1752.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it's the position of the state of Colorado in this case that the report of the Special Master provides for a fair allocation, an equitable apportionment of the water of the Vermejo River."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.215,1808.418,I'll wait until you get to your point.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1809.239,1823.418,"--Fourth, I would like to emphasize by reviewing some of the cases, the fourth point would be that the Special Master's report is entirely in accord with prior decisions of this Court."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.492,1828.161,"No, you go ahead."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1829.863,1833.222,"Preliminarily, I am a western water attorney."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.933,2049.304,How do you know what he was referring to?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2053.107,2063.245,"Justice White, in his report he said that the system of canals used to transport the water to the fields is inefficient."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.245,2064.184,On what page are you?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2064.184,2067.827,I'm at page 8 of his report.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.298,2131.38,"So what if there is, Mr. Welborn?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2131.38,2147.552,"Well, this, Justice White, gets to my first and my third point, which is really the basic point here, and that has to do with the elimination of waste by the district that will offset the Colorado allocation."
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.423,2255.41,"Mr. Welborn, do our cases require a state to... or a prior appropriator... to make that kind of structural change to utilize the water more efficiently?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2259.273,2260.495,"--Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor."
1982.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.314,2300.209,"I don't want to interrupt your response to Justice O'Connor, but let me just throw in this question and answer it when you can, if you wish."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2348.923,2355.208,"--I think that I can answer, then, perhaps both questions at the same time."
1982.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.695,2394.561,But don't most state systems that follow the appropriation system themselves allow for discounting of wasteful uses?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2394.561,2400.035,"They do not... it's a matter of degree, of course, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.821,2452.612,From the Purgatoire?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2452.612,2454.512,"--Excuse me, on the Vermejo."
1982.80_orig,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2543.881,2547.073,May I ask this question.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2567.646,2574.001,"I'm saying that the decisions have said that, Your Honor."
1982.80_orig,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2574.001,2577.211,"I think the Master in this case also said it, didn't he?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2577.211,2578.312,The decisions have said that.
1982.80_orig,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2661.486,2679.108,"So that, if I understand your correctly, if a state, with respect to an interstate river, had never used any water before and the other state was making 100 percent use of it, the state that had never used any water still would be entitled to some."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2679.108,2691.227,I'm suggesting that that would be a matter for the Court to consider in its balancing of equities; that the door is not closed for the new use.
1982.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.992,2704.644,But the first two were riparian states.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2704.644,2708.257,"The first two, Justice Rehnquist, were riparian states, but there's a great similarity."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.908,2802.158,"Mr. Welborn, do you think the findings of the Special Master are adequate for us to tell what the impact would be on the conservancy district if Colorado is given a priority for 4000 feet of water?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2802.158,2804.439,"Justice White, I do think that they are adequate."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.439,2815.448,"Well, do we know from the Master's report how much the average historic use is, for example?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2815.448,2820.25,The average historic use in the Vermejo Conservancy District?
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.25,2821.542,By these four users.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2821.542,2829.616,"I don't believe that it gives the detail of that, but I respectfully suggest that if--"
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.616,2831.058,You certainly argue a lot about it.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2831.058,2832.118,--I beg your pardon?
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.118,2834.809,Your brief certainly argues a lot about it.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2834.809,2836.251,We do discuss it in our brief.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.251,2855.684,"But the Master didn't find it, and do you think that the priority given Colorado would mean that some of the historic use, average use, would be interfered with in New Mexico?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2855.684,2856.154,No.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.604,2862.088,You think there's enough water to satisfy Colorado's priority?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2862.088,2870.753,"--This is exactly right, and I don't believe for that purpose the Special Master need to have gone into the detail of the uses there."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.524,2878.498,"If that's true, he could have avoided... he might have avoided a lot of argument about... that you've been making."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2900.614,2907.64,"--Not necessarily, Justice White, and I will explain why not."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.552,2919.477,"Well, the Special Master certainly didn't get into these facts."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2919.477,2922.278,"--He didn't get into these facts, but he found that there would be--"
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.278,2924.75,"But there was evidence in the record from which he could have made these findings, couldn't he?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2924.75,2926.16,--He found that--
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.16,2931.803,Wasn't there evidence from which he could have made the kind of findings that you want us to recognize in your brief?
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2931.803,2940.221,"--There certainly evidence, and I would, if I may, like to point that out because I think it's very basic to this case."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.615,2968.287,"But you say that the conservancy district wouldn't even feel it, in an average year."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2968.287,2969.439,--The reason I say--
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.439,2970.9,"Well, do you say that or not?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2970.9,2971.971,--I do say that.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.971,2976.993,"Now I ask you again, what about a dry year?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2988.16,2997.697,"The conservancy district... and this is the purpose, Justice White, of the reservoir system... the conservancy district operates on the basis of these reservoirs."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.697,2998.758,I understand that.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2998.758,3001.56,That contain thousands of acre feet of water.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.56,3003.821,"All right, five straight dry years."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3006.983,3012.527,In five straight dry years of--
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.527,3015.168,"That is not unheard of, is it?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3018.511,3040.904,"--Well, I don't believe the records... Colorado's Exhibit 5, Table 2, tabulates the U.S. Geological Survey records for the period of record at the Dawson Gauge, and they don't find a period of five straight years that you have that sort of a situation, but I would--"
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.904,3047.94,"--I would suggest if you were going to make this kind of submission, that even in a dry year the conservancy district isn't going to get hurt."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3060.679,3066.025,--I would acknowledge if there were five straight years you would see a--
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.025,3066.894,Or even one dry year.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3066.894,3081.593,--I would like to point out that the Colorado diversion would take place at a point from which approximately only one-half of the Colorado production of water could be taken.
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.215,3105.779,"Well, yes, but it would still reduce the amount of water that reached the state line by 4,000 acre feet."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3105.779,3116.217,"It would reduce the amount of water that would reach the state line, and if you have the hypothetical situation of five straight years, I won't say there wouldn't be an effect."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.966,3122.769,"Well, I don't even know from the findings of the Master whether there would be an effect in one dry year."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3122.769,3131.535,"But in a dry year, of course, the amount of water Colorado could take would be diminished in proportion to the amount of water anyone else could take."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.535,3132.056,"Well, I don't know."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3139.662,3159.484,"That, as I say, geographically, that wouldn't happen because of the diversion points, and I would suggest that in the decree in this case, the diversion points could be specified to be those named in the Colorado decree or points above those that are named."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.484,3170.771,"Well, I would think Colorado, under this allocation, could take up to 4,000 acre feet out of those particular streams."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3170.771,3182.579,"Well, as I say, if the diversion is limited to those diversion points, there would be a built-in safety factor, but this gets back, Justice White, to the basic point."
1982.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.579,3183.861,"Well, I don't understand that."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3183.861,3203.523,"That the states stand in these proceedings on the basis of equality of right, and as New Mexico has said in each brief, in the Arizona versus California, states have sovereign interests, and that what these cases consider is a division of the benefits."
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3207.336,3217.762,"Mr. Welborn, in order to make your argument that New Mexico wouldn't be hurt, do you have to assume that New Mexico will have made more efficient use of the water?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3217.762,3218.723,That is correct.
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3218.723,3220.226,That is your basic assumption--
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3220.226,3220.643,That is correct.
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3220.643,3226.728,--that they have gone out and put underground pipes or something in to take water to water the stock.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3226.728,3227.399,No.
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3249.204,3258.928,"But the point is, for you to say New Mexico wouldn't be hurt, you are assuming New Mexico will apply some conservation measures that have not historically been applied."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3258.928,3262.391,"--That is quite correct, Justice O'Connor, and I think that bears on the equity."
1982.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3277.692,3291.089,"But to what extent do you think courts have a right to get in in these disputes and weigh the extent to which ditches should be lined, or pipelines installed, or new storage facilities built, and so on?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3291.089,3296.174,"I think, Justice O'Connor, this Court has gotten into those things in some detail."
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.229,3402.944,"Mr. Welborn, with all of this, it strikes me none of this was in the Master's report."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3402.944,3405.396,I suggest--
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3405.396,3407.807,"Well, I would like to ask you a very simple question."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3416.423,3419.024,--I think that--
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3419.024,3422.567,How many findings we will have to make that the Master did not make.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3422.567,3429.801,"--Did you want me to list those and just how many in terms of number, or do you want me to describe them?"
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.801,3430.852,Either way.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3430.852,3441.537,"Well, I should think that the Court could base its conclusions on the finding of the Special Master that there would be no material injury to--"
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3441.537,3444.949,There's a difference in your thinking between conclusions and findings.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3444.949,3448.222,--And I suggest that the Court--
1982.80_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3448.222,3449.924,I'm talking about findings.
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3449.924,3457.879,"--Right, could look at the record, as New Mexico has even suggested, and determine these factors."
1982.80_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.432,3480.614,"Mr. Welborn, doesn't that involve a change in the theory of the Master?"
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3496.685,3500.599,"And I think, Justice Stevens, that is a proper rule of law."
1982.80_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.599,3502.889,"But if you followed that rule, you don't need any more findings."
1982.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,3503.649,3505.752,"Yes, I think you do."
1982.80_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3789.447,3791.209,Very well.
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3794.001,3810.781,"First of all, I want to remark that no decision of this Court in any prior equitable apportionment case has sought to sacrifice an existing economy to facilitate a new use."
1982.80_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3825.3,3831.155,"Mr. Simms, are you saying that the prior appropriation is the controlling factor in all of these cases?"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3831.155,3833.405,"It is the controlling factor here, very obviously."
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3858.312,3863.385,"Mr. Simms, may I ask you on that point, does the law of the upstream state have a bearing on your argument?"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3875.183,3882.078,--I think in either situation there would still be the attempt by the Court to protect existing economies.
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3894.436,3899.719,"In other words, are you willing to say that the law of Colorado is irrelevant to your position, simply because--"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3899.719,3901.85,"No, the law of Colorado is not irrelevant to our position."
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3909.567,3911.307,"--My question is, what if it were different in Colorado."
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3911.307,3913.39,If it were different--
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3913.39,3915.29,"If your argument depends entirely on future use, then it would be irrelevant."
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3918.943,3922.834,"--No, if it were different, the issues would be slightly different."
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3939.316,3952.875,"Well, is it your position that if two states are in dispute, and if the downstream state succeeds in appropriating all the water that it needs before the upstream state appropriates any water, the upstream state can never get any water?"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3952.875,3961.319,"That's correct, and the best way to answer that, I think, Justice Stevens, is, imagine for the moment this were an intrastate stream in Colorado, fully appropriated--"
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3961.319,3962.01,"Well, I understand the interests."
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3965.302,3966.962,--I can't answer that question.
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3970.866,3972.916,And then say Montana appropriate all the water in a stream that originated in Canada.
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3975.808,3980.623,I don't think there is enough international law on that subject to answer that question.
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3997.164,4002.298,"Well, that's right, because they all originate in the same source of law, but what is the source of law on which you rely?"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,4002.298,4002.786,--The source--
1982.80_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4002.786,4004.028,"It is all New Mexico law, is it not?"
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,4004.028,4012.443,--The source of law on which I rely is the federal common law handed down by this Court in each and every one of the equitable apportionment cases.
1982.80_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4012.443,4015.575,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Simms."
1982.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,4015.575,4016.086,Thank you.
1982.80_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4016.086,4017.197,"Thank you, gentlemen."
