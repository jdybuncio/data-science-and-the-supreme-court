2010.09-291,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-291, Thompson v. North American Stainless."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,7.62,9.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.804,113.756,Is Ms. Regalado still engaged to this fellow?
2010.09-291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.756,114.723,They're married?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,114.723,115.891,I'm sorry.
2010.09-291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.658,117.425,Yes.
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,117.425,118.91,They're married.
2010.09-291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.91,119.793,"Oh, they're married."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,119.793,121.195,And they have a lovely 2-year-old daughter.
2010.09-291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.195,121.895,"Oh, good."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,123.845,132.401,"I think, Your Honor, that this Court's Article III jurisprudence would have precluded her from getting any remedy."
2010.09-291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.029,160.07,Could she have gotten reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing hurt to her?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,160.07,163.439,--Perhaps.
2010.09-291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.966,189.155,"Suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and is a very valuable employee."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,200.212,201.58,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.699,218.941,"Because you start with somebody who is unlike the shareholders, there is no Title VII violation as to them."
2010.09-291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.636,239.188,"No, it's the same hypothetical."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,246.108,250.812,I think the thrust of your question was -- is: Are the shareholders like Thompson?
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,265.988,269.69,The question is whether he's aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII.
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,269.69,270.892,That is the other question.
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,270.892,278.563,"And your argument is that if there is injury, in fact, sufficient to satisfy Article III of the Constitution, then the person is aggrieved."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,278.563,290.889,"The Court's decision in Trafficante goes that far, and in practice it has not proved a problem under Title VIII."
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,293.172,297.126,Is it your argument that we have -- that we should go that far?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,297.126,297.793,We do not--
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,297.793,300.495,We don't need to go that far?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,300.495,301.428,--You don't need to go that far.
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,301.428,302.428,Where do we draw the line?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,302.428,325.86,"Well, I think the Government -- I think as far as you need to go, which is not the same as saying, that's as far as the law goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the very method by which the law was violated; that that would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved."
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,325.86,326.978,Where does that come from?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,329.062,336.251,"Your Honor, I don't -- I think that's as far as you need to go in this case."
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,354.88,356.165,I understand the argument.
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,393.005,400.694,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there are two other limitations that would be applicable here, as indeed they would have be under Title VIII."
2010.09-291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.47,502.892,What -- what do you do with the argument that says there's a middle step?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,522.99,527.209,"--Well, the -- we think that's just clearly wrong."
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,576.407,581.011,Suppose Thompson were not Regalado's fiancee at the time.
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,597.354,599.89,"--Well, the -- the plaintiff would have to prove two things."
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,633.313,634.146,How does that translate?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,672.954,673.854,"--Well, I think--"
2010.09-291,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,673.854,676.323,Can you help -- can you help provide where the clear line is?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,694.201,696.219,--They wouldn't all have to go to a jury.
2010.09-291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.233,725.156,"Well, why can't -- why can't they get -- the first question, to go back, is a confusion in my mind: Why couldn't she bring this suit?"
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,760.16,766.316,I think that that kind of remedy would pose very serious problems under Article III.
2010.09-291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.316,767.066,Why?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,767.066,768.0,Because money isn't going to her.
2010.09-291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,768.0,769.0,So what?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,801.739,805.775,"Well, I think it -- I think it is of some -- some importance here."
2010.09-291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.963,826.438,"--But that's because the award of money to be paid for somebody else, their absence of money, didn't hurt you, but where there -- for example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to get the beneficiary put back."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,841.698,847.102,"Well, as -- as I say, I think -- I think Article III would be -- would be a major obstacle there."
2010.09-291,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,847.102,860.509,"I understood your brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a very expansive view of what type of retaliation would give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly harmed employee."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,865.479,878.323,"I think we've got a situation here in which this violates the rights of Regalado, but Regalado's ability to herself bring a lawsuit and get a remedy is limited, and that -- that--"
2010.09-291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.323,882.708,You're not taking the position that she could not have sued in retaliation?
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,898.134,902.688,--It's possible she could bring a suit.
2010.09-291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,910.275,925.285,Let me -- because your time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely affected close relatives.
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,935.492,941.979,"If I might respond to that briefly, you're referring to section 12112(b)(4) of the ADA."
2010.09-291,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.736,977.436,Thank you--
2010.09-291,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.436,987.775,"But the Fair Housing Act has a definition of injury that would include Mr. Thompson, and that's not in this act, that express language."
2010.09-291,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,987.775,990.477,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1022.947,1023.864,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1039.643,1042.376,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.037,1060.806,Can I ask you this?
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.589,1070.678,"Put yourself in the -- in the shoes of an employer, and you -- you think -- you want to take an adverse employment action against employee A."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1110.822,1118.476,"Justice Alito, we are not arguing for a test that would create a kind of protection for a so-called right of association under Title VII."
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1136.688,1137.306,I understand that.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1155.518,1157.051,"--No, I think it's actually quite the contrary."
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1171.794,1183.168,"Well, but you say, but it won't be because of the degree of connection between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the means of retaliating."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1208.486,1217.924,"Well, if there's -- I don't think there's any reason for the Court to try to fashion a hard and fast rule that identifies some relationships that are close enough and others that aren't."
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1228.263,1234.017,"But Burlington Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in that case."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1244.056,1256.716,"--Well, it's certainly going to be important whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like this both to establish that the employer knew of the relationship and the relationship was one that is of sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be deterred from making or--"
2010.09-291,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1256.716,1259.584,Why does that matter under your theory?
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1282.95,1283.9,--Well--
2010.09-291,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1283.9,1290.271,--if the intent was to retaliate against the person complaining of discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's supporting them?
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1290.271,1294.675,"--In that scenario, I think that that person would have a cause of action, but for a different reason."
2010.09-291,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1304.363,1308.315,So an opposer is anyone who -- who assists?
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1308.315,1312.284,That's our understanding of what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.
2010.09-291,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1312.284,1315.754,"Let's assume they did it in private, but the employer knew it."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1331.881,1350.242,"I think that -- again, I think it's a question that sort of turns on whether a jury would find that a reasonable employee in the position of the person who had engaged in protected activity would be deterred from making or supporting a charge of discrimination if they knew the consequence was that their best friend would be fired."
2010.09-291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.242,1353.879,I don't want to have to go before a jury as an employer all the time.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1372.941,1375.627,"Well, I think that it would be an essentially arbitrary rule."
2010.09-291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.627,1376.31,I know.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1376.31,1382.797,"At end of the day, the question is just the question that the Court assigns under Burlington Northern."
2010.09-291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.184,1387.817,"Yes, but as--"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1387.817,1389.636,"I think, in defense of the Court--"
2010.09-291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.636,1392.088,"--As the Chief said, it -- it spreads much further than Burlington Northern."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1405.646,1416.37,"--Well, an employer always is going to have to be careful to some degree not to visit harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons."
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1416.37,1417.754,But you're -- you're a reasonable person.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1420.906,1425.059,I don't think that there's any way to fashion a hard and fast rule.
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1463.934,1465.317,Very good friends is enough?
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1465.317,1476.575,I think that a reasonable employee who knows that the consequence of making or supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be that their best friend at work is going to be fired may be deterred from engaging in protected activity.
2010.09-291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.575,1480.444,"In -- in your view, could Regalado have brought this suit, or brought a suit?"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1480.444,1487.883,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the statute."
2010.09-291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1487.883,1493.87,"Well, if that is so, why doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the act?"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1493.87,1496.989,"Well, for two reasons, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.431,1525.508,"Well, but I -- I assume that part of the thrust of your argument is that this was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well, it's not important enough for her to sue."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1528.71,1537.649,"--Well, I think in that situation, that she certainly -- she might sue, but she also might assume it ought to be her fiancee whose job was actually lost who ought to carry--"
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.649,1538.766,"Well, can't they talk about that?"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1538.766,1539.466,--They might--
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.466,1541.118,"I mean, it's not like you're dealing with strangers."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1553.492,1563.198,"--Well, the fact that they were close at the time of the retaliatory act doesn't necessarily mean that they might still be close at the time that they need to decide whether or not to press charges."
2010.09-291,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1563.198,1572.656,"The point you were first making, I thought, was: These are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they would naturally think that the person who was hurt would be the one to sue."
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1572.656,1574.272,"That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.122,1576.524,Why is that a problem?
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1587.915,1590.883,--They may not be close by the time--
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.883,1591.5,They are lay people.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1592.933,1596.085,"--Well, that is certainly one point."
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.714,1619.018,"Well, if someone in Thompson's position filed a charge with the EEOC, couldn't the EEOC tell him, you're the wrong person to sue?"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1619.018,1621.803,"It conceivably could, but that is--"
2010.09-291,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.803,1623.422,But the EEOC thinks that he's the right person.
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1623.422,1626.29,"--Well, the EEOC certainly does think he's the right person."
2010.09-291,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1628.606,1632.194,"If the rule is that -- if the rule is otherwise, why couldn't they provide advice?"
2010.09-291,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1632.194,1642.9,"--The EEOC is ordinarily not in the business of advising people who filed charges with respect to charges that other people might file, for confidentiality reasons, among other reasons."
2010.09-291,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.9,1644.602,"Thank you, Ms. Kruger."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1650.489,1652.941,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-291,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1662.464,1675.787,Do you -- if Regalado had sued and said -- assume the fact; I know that you claim it didn't happen -- they fired my fiancee to retaliate against me.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1675.787,1676.556,--Okay.
2010.09-291,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1676.556,1685.579,Do you agree with your adversary that she wouldn't have Article III standing to seek reinstatement or back pay for her fiancee?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1685.579,1692.399,I don't -- I do think she could seek reinstatement to get general equitable relief of the court.
2010.09-291,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.355,1701.989,I would like to see that case next--
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1701.989,1703.041,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-291,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1703.041,1705.207,--and see what position you take the next time.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1715.014,1715.681,Okay.
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.672,1735.428,"You know, but if you concede that she could have sued, then what's the big deal?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1758.627,1765.114,I agree that she can bring the cause of action based upon Burlington and the way that the language is written in Burlington.
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.868,1773.47,Okay.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1784.593,1785.195,No.
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.396,1790.079,Okay.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1790.079,1797.899,"But I think that the way that Burlington reads now, and that is whether someone would be dissuaded, if that is harm to her then she could bring the cause of action."
2010.09-291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.05,1826.668,So you're saying an employer could adopt that policy?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1826.668,1828.537,I'm sorry?
2010.09-291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.537,1831.656,Are you saying an employer could adopt that policy?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1831.656,1835.441,"No, I'm not, because the person who is discriminated against--"
2010.09-291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.441,1851.218,"So if an employer says, now, if anybody makes a discrimination claim, we're going to fire two other employees just to show you that we run an efficient corporation here, you say that that is proper or improper?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1851.218,1855.287,"--It's improper, because the person who was discriminated against would have the right to sue."
2010.09-291,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.287,1858.723,Who is the person who is discriminated against in the hypothetical?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1858.723,1862.691,The person who -- the person who filed the EEOC charge.
2010.09-291,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.691,1863.641,Okay.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1863.641,1865.377,What makes this case a little cloudy--
2010.09-291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.377,1869.495,"But the persons, the two people in the hypothetical that are fired can't sue?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1869.495,1877.101,"--They cannot, not under the discrimination provision of Title VII, because they were not discriminated against based upon their conduct."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.809,1906.22,"Why should -- in this World War II Nazi scenario, why would the woman who caused the random firing, why would she bring a lawsuit if these people are really nothing to her?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1915.06,1916.693,"--She may not, but the EEOC could."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.693,1918.512,--She might not even like the people who were fired.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,1918.512,1923.082,"In which case she wouldn't have been injured, so she would have no claim."
2010.09-291,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.762,2001.016,"Well, but his point was that ""aggrieved"" includes not only injury, but wrongfulness."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2012.39,2015.258,But it's -- it's treating Regalado with discrimination.
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.316,2028.649,You couldn't win on that under Burlington.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2103.966,2104.533,--Yes.
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.533,2106.435,So why don't we get to the second question?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2137.471,2138.406,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.406,2139.506,That was picked up by the APA.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2139.506,2140.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.339,2142.024,"It says ""person aggrieved""."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2161.836,2162.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.772,2166.574,"You don't have to -- I'm just asking a question, quite a long question."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.574,2172.311,You don't even have to agree with his description of what Sanders Brothers and the APA say.
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.311,2175.33,"You don't, but it would be pretty hard to do that, because it's in black and white here."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.33,2185.535,Isn't there a doctrine of the scope of persons protected under a particular statute?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2185.535,2186.67,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.67,2192.374,"Doesn't the word ""person aggrieved"" bring that whole lore along with it?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2192.374,2194.241,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.241,2216.923,"Can we go back to -- first, you agree that it is unlawful to retaliate against a person who filed a complaint under Title VII by dismissing a close relative?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2219.874,2223.326,"I believe it could meet the standard under Burlington, yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2223.326,2226.862,Do you want to get back to Justice Breyer's question?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2228.864,2229.514,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.647,2278.597,I'm not sure it's broader.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2310.616,2315.503,"Yes, I -- I believe it should be read into Title VII, because that's the term ""aggrieved""."
2010.09-291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.386,2348.807,"That's not -- that's not an altogether novel question, but it has come up under some other statutes."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2376.125,2377.242,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.074,2398.724,Ms.--
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2398.724,2399.44,And Title VII--
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.44,2400.674,"--Go on, I'm sorry, finish."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2400.674,2401.442,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.113,2417.869,"That's -- that's why this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the interest to be protected against had nothing to do with protecting competitors from competition."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2492.434,2496.321,"And I'm sorry, and your question is?"
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2496.321,2514.865,"If, in fact, you set in motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the coworker, though that would be hard to get pass Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to retaliate against A, B can bring the suit?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2523.571,2528.209,"But, Your Honor, respectfully, there's no basis in the statute to adopt that rule."
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.209,2529.825,That is the problem with my theory.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2533.011,2533.511,I'm glad--
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.511,2559.744,"But there are -- I do -- I think that it isn't so hard to find in some of the sources that Justice Ginsburg mentioned and others instances where the only kinds of suits that have been allowed are where it was like a family member or was being used as a means, and there never have been cases where they allowed somebody who was just suffering consequent injury."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2566.834,2603.423,"--If we look at the kinds of cases, for example, the Trafficante case, and the other cases under the APA where Congress has used this broad language or has interpreted the term v. Spear, the environmental species act or the Blue Shield of Virginia case, which was a Sherman Act case, the injury or the act, the violation -- the violation in those cases had the potential to -- to inflict harm on a large group of people."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.067,2624.587,"I don't see where you're going, the employee has to fire three fiancees or a larger number of--"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2624.587,2636.811,"--No, my point is, is that if we're looking at trying to compare Title VII and whether or not we're going to impose some prudential limitations on the ago aggrieved language, those statutes are different than the statutes that we have--"
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.811,2639.863,"--But, you know, I don't know what aggrieved means, I don't think anybody does."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2658.677,2672.084,"--Your Honor, this is not a situation like Calleleki, where the Court is trying to determine on something about a procedure within the EEOC, and that is, what does it mean for a charge, because you need some kind of special expertise."
2010.09-291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2689.879,2696.219,It's not a 100 percent -- he thought there might be an Article III impediment.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2737.194,2741.081,"I -- I agree with that, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2760.059,2769.315,But this is a -- an interpretation of the substantive meaning of the statute.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2769.315,2770.1,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.1,2773.552,It doesn't have to do with the evidence in a particular hearing.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2791.613,2792.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.487,2834.29,What's -- what's the function of the compliance manual?
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2838.325,2840.861,I don't know--
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.861,2841.761,But they have to leave him alone.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2847.865,2849.567,"--Yes, they can."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.567,2858.489,"So can the Justice Department, but we don't defer, thank goodness, to the Justice Department's interpretation of the criminal law, do we?"
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2858.489,2861.608,No.
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.608,2862.408,No.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2862.408,2869.131,"Your Honor, the concerns from the employment side in this case are substantial."
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.247,2924.997,22 and 23 of--
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2924.997,2926.133,--The joint appendix.
2010.09-291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.133,2927.249,--Okay.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,2927.249,2931.537,He says in this memo: I am disappointed in compensation this year.
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.028,3101.797,I'm not sure why the employer's intent comes into this.
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,3129.899,3137.922,--But the position that's set forward by Thompson is you determine whether someone is a protected party by looking at the intent of the employer.
2010.09-291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.922,3143.826,"Well, you would have to show he had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true however he retaliates."
2010.09-291,2,34742,leigh_gross_latherow,,3143.826,3156.466,"That's true at trial, though, after a plaintiff gets past his initial burden of proof, and in this case the plaintiff is going to be able to establish their burden of proof solely by saying that they were a protected party and there was intent on the other side."
2010.09-291,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3225.96,3227.146,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3230.348,3232.55,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-291,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.733,3243.588,"Mr. Schnapper, in the point you are making, would you have an answer to the -- this point that was made about the burden of proof?"
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3252.027,3259.681,"Your Honor, McDonnell Douglas -- the particular formula in McDonnell Douglas was for hiring cases."
2010.09-291,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3280.678,3282.212,I'm not sure why not.
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3282.212,3282.946,--What?
2010.09-291,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3282.946,3284.046,I'm not sure why not.
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3290.402,3291.818,"Well, probably -- the other person did."
2010.09-291,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3291.818,3293.252,--The other person did.
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3318.636,3320.004,"Well, there has to be -- right."
2010.09-291,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.966,3371.87,What happens in the -- what happens in the animal shelter hypothetical that your friend proposed?
2010.09-291,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3387.047,3394.136,I don't -- I don't -- I think this Court's decision in Burlington Northern makes it clear that the plaintiff wouldn't have to be an employee.
2010.09-291,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.357,3428.074,--Thank you.
