2014.13-1032,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case No. 13-1032, Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, Executive Director, Colorado Department of Revenue."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,11.489,15.776,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.068,186.635,"Well, it often happens."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,190.356,191.189,--Well--
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.189,193.641,"I mean, the fact that she didn't raise it is irrelevant."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,198.293,214.822,"--I believe that certainly for purposes of comity, Your Honor, the decision on the part of the government to seek the resolution of the matter in -- in a court is -- constitutes effectively a waiver of -- of the comity question."
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.822,216.238,"Oh, the comity, okay."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,220.709,221.042,No.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.516,238.17,Excuse -- if the -- if the -- would the State be seeking the relief?
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,238.17,238.687,--Yes.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.403,241.472,The State would be seeking to enjoin its own tax?
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,241.472,244.341,--What -- what the State -- State sought was a summary judgment.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.709,251.178,"Well, but that -- that just means the district court should throw it out."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,252.028,253.911,But that wasn't the request on summary judgment.
2014.13-1032,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,261.734,265.769,"Actually, you have raised the very question I started with, which is the waiver question."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,300.524,301.274,That's correct.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.942,330.044,--But the statute's addressed to the courts.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,345.053,346.153,Well--
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.153,349.524,"It seems to me it says that we just don't have the power, period."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,351.674,352.476,--I believe they can.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.909,383.878,"Well, that's -- that's fine."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,413.695,439.162,"Well, I -- I think the State's argument is weaker not merely because they changed their mind, but because I think they made a studied decision that the Tax Injunction Act, by its terms, and what the Court is presented with is an issue of statutory construction as construed by the executive director to the point of informing both the appellate court and -- and this Court that the Tax Injunction Act was not a jurisdictional bar."
2014.13-1032,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.672,456.541,"Mr. Isaacson, can we get to the nub of this question?"
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,501.836,515.995,"--So I believe, Justice Ginsburg, those cases that you're referring to, like the Blangeres case and the Sipe's case, are situations in which it was the taxpayer that was seeking to prevent that information-reporting from taking place."
2014.13-1032,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,532.107,533.291,But suppose it weren't the taxpayer.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,550.485,557.172,"In that case, I believe that the Tax Injunction Act would bar -- the Tax Injunction Act would not bar Federal court jurisdiction."
2014.13-1032,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.095,570.247,So -- so you say the words “ assessment ” and “ levy ” in the statute apply only to taxpayers.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,570.247,570.916,--No.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.287,604.12,But--
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.12,606.322,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.322,607.189,My very point.
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,608.455,620.929,The question is whether the word “ collection ” includes an injunction that makes it more difficult for the State to collect the tax.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,687.821,695.411,"--So, Justice Breyer, I think you have to read the word “ injunction ”, which is the first set of operative words--"
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,695.411,697.096,It doesn't say anywhere “ injunction ”.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,697.096,697.479,--Enjoin.
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.479,701.231,"What the word is, “ enjoin ”, “ suspend ” or “ restrain ”."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,747.962,757.834,"So the words “ enjoin ” and “ suspend ” operate on the words “ assessment ”, “ levy ” and “ collection ”."
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.834,758.117,Yes.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,758.117,775.113,"And as this Court ruled in the -- in the Hibbs case, in which even though the Court was divided on the issue of the meaning of the term “ assessment ”, which was the key issue in -- in that case, that the assessment is the recording of liability."
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.763,830.864,"So your point is that if, in fact, there is in Colorado a law somewhat like Federal law that says all employers must report to the State the wages that in this Boulder area, or Denver, we pay our employees and someone tries to enjoin that law in Federal court, you are saying they can do it."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,843.773,858.45,"Well, in the W-2 concept, what Justice Kagan was referring to, there's a tax liability responsibility that the employer themselves have, so that I think that a court might well conclude that because of the obligation--"
2014.13-1032,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.45,859.233,1099s.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,859.233,871.258,"--In that situation, I think if it's a third party, that third party is an outsider as this Court defined outsider, an individual whose own tax liability is not of relevance."
2014.13-1032,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,895.64,900.96,What about the Alexander v. Americans United case under the Anti-Injunction Act?
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,911.752,912.585,--Right.
2014.13-1032,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.245,960.498,"But where -- where do you get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the -- the plaintiff has to be the taxpayer?"
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,971.389,992.386,"--I think the discussion of the Tax Injunction Act in the Levin case, Levin v. Commerce Energy, where a group is identified as outsiders, individuals or entities whose own tax liability is not of relevance to the -- to the case, is the source of -- of that authority."
2014.13-1032,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.97,1034.797,"I guess I don't -- what I don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean, it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight, and we're going to take up a collection to buy the pizza."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1082.96,1086.514,"I think two responses, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1032,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1154.892,1161.563,"--But you're saying that collection is only as the money changes hands, that that's the only thing that constitutes collection?"
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1161.563,1161.93,--No.
2014.13-1032,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1171.853,1175.222,So -- so you're saying it's just like garnishment or things like that?
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1181.126,1190.915,It -- it certainly goes far beyond garnishment and would include any activities on the part of government officials once the taxpayer's liability has been determined.
2014.13-1032,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1190.915,1198.255,"So you've got to know that he or she owes $1,482 because they've done the calculations and they haven't paid that over."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1198.255,1198.671,Yes.
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.347,1218.599,"Well, I'm not sure what -- what you have conceded."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1266.746,1274.35,"Well, I'm not sure what the basis, the underlying basis for Federal jurisdiction would be in -- in the hypothetical that -- that you have--"
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.35,1277.386,"Well, it's -- it's a Federal constitutional violation."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1277.386,1282.79,"--I think if it's a Federal constitutional violation, the Tax Injunction Act would not be a bar to it."
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.795,1315.244,"So the only thing that would make the States able to do -- to get information about tax liability without being sued in Federal court is the fact that the person from whom the information is sought is liable for the tax, if the seller has to retain the sales tax."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1315.244,1327.485,"Well, as I -- as I pointed out, there may be circumstances in which you have a third party that is effectively acting in regard to a taxpayer's liability."
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.722,1335.855,I don't know what you mean by a third party acting in regard to--
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1335.855,1337.274,"It could be a successor in interest, for example."
2014.13-1032,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.274,1338.624,"--Oh, of course."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1338.624,1344.361,But I think you have two convergences here that would -- would not necessarily be present in the hypothetical that you present.
2014.13-1032,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.429,1400.447,But the -- the State's not interested in just liability.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1405.082,1405.601,--Absolutely.
2014.13-1032,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.118,1409.47,So it seems to me that that -- that's just not responsive to the issue.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1409.47,1424.063,"--No, I -- I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, that the -- in this case the Direct Marketing Association members are not challenging the authority of the State to pursue collection of tax revenues from customers."
2014.13-1032,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.78,1428.448,"We're talking not about what you're challenging, we're talking about what the State's interest is."
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1428.448,1441.356,--The fact that the State has an interest in this information and much of the briefing that the State has presented emphasizes the importance of this -- of this information to -- to their tax system.
2014.13-1032,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1442.956,1444.224,But it's importance for a reason.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1471.475,1476.779,--I'm not sure that the State is saying they're not able to collect the tax absent this information.
2014.13-1032,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1501.477,1508.75,But wouldn't you agree that in any case in which a -- a government goes about collecting the tax it has to say how are we going to collect this tax.
2014.13-1032,0,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1525.526,1544.006,"I believe the -- I believe the issue that the Court is confronted with is in the construction of this statute in regard to what the meaning of the word “ collection ” means in the context of being associated with assessment, levy, and collection."
2014.13-1032,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.151,1565.053,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1572.49,1575.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.452,1595.356,Am I correct that Colorado is the only State that seeks to do this with respect to out-of-State sellers?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1595.356,1598.991,Colorado is the only State with this precise combination--
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.991,1600.593,That -- that's amazing.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1625.975,1632.381,"--Well, of course, the question on the merits is whether there are, in fact, problems with it."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.381,1632.797,No.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1633.714,1634.431,And--
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.431,1640.987,But the fact that it's -- it's a one of a kind gives me some pause.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1652.459,1653.044,"--Well, I would agree with that."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.044,1656.346,And all sellers will also have to be providing this information.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1656.346,1661.231,"Certainly, I think if we ultimately prevail on the merits, that's true."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.535,1685.432,Let's assume I am a not -- not-for-profit -- an unpopular not-for-profit corporation that has members who don't -- who don't want their identity known because hurtful things will be done to them.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1721.622,1725.341,"Justice Scalia, I'm telling you that cannot get into Federal court."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.829,1735.531,It can't be that central if no other State has it.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1735.531,1736.698,Justice--
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.698,1738.048,How central can it be?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1738.048,1748.106,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the use tax is obviously a large and growing portion of -- of the tax base that States should be able to collect."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.497,1763.782,I'm -- I'm a little bit confused.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1782.443,1783.879,That's right.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1783.879,1784.479,All right.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1795.753,1801.241,"Well, it comes indirectly, that the States typically get that information from the IRS."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1806.443,1807.493,So there is no -- okay.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1816.899,1817.567,--Correct.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1817.567,1824.738,--for certain entities in which they're resident or working.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1824.738,1825.555,Right.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1825.555,1829.541,And so that's because of jurisdictional powers.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1829.541,1830.224,That's right.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1830.224,1833.693,The State can control someone who is within their jurisdiction.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1833.693,1834.243,Right.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1834.243,1837.128,So that makes sense to me.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1864.628,1870.282,"Well, the -- I don't think that the TIA says that."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1878.705,1880.574,How are -- how are they enjoined?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1895.499,1906.122,--It is stopping us from using the tool -- the means provided under Colorado law for assessing and collecting that tax.
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.122,1922.732,"Let's -- let's assume a State law that gives the State taxing authority a lot of money for new computers, and somebody challenges that law on some State ground, whatever it is."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1944.245,1945.763,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.763,1946.213,Why not?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,1946.213,1960.69,"The circuit courts have -- have addressed these types of questions much more often than this Court have, and they've uniformly -- at least eight of them that have addressed that kind of question have drawn essentially the same line."
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.103,1983.388,That isn't a very narrowing thing.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2010.537,2011.587,--I don't think--
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.587,2016.024,GDP consists of about $16 trillion.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2072.693,2077.097,"--Justice Breyer, I agree with you, that's the strongest argument against us."
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.322,2094.291,"Really, you can't ask your citizens the same way that the Federal government asks us?"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2115.206,2131.499,"--Justice Breyer, indirectly, at least, Colorado makes the same statement to its citizens about this tax, but it can't determine who owes the tax and they can't determine how much they owe, and it therefore--"
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.499,2132.199,If they tell you the truth.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2132.199,2134.399,"--That would be nice, yes."
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.399,2135.751,This is the west.
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.934,2145.273,Can it make the -- the foreign seller collect the tax?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2145.273,2147.559,Not under Quill.
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.559,2151.761,"Well, that is sort of strange."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2167.036,2167.955,"Well, this is exactly--"
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.955,2169.888,--I don't know why the one and not the other.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2169.888,2173.107,--This is exactly their argument on the merits.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2179.596,2179.913,Couldn't we--
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2179.913,2182.113,Can I ask a question about where your argument might lead?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2247.005,2254.494,"--Justice Alito, that is where this could lead and that's a slightly more detailed version of their argument on the merits."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.036,2301.74,"But you know that we accept minuscule, minuscule percentage of appeals from State supreme courts."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2338.248,2345.835,"--Justice Scalia, that's an argument that Congress has rejected in enacting the Tax Injunction Act."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.835,2347.354,"Well, for collection, yes."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2347.354,2349.973,Assessment and collection of the tax.
2014.13-1032,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2349.973,2369.869,"Mr. Domenico, you don't dispute that what Congress had in mind when it passed the Tax Injunction Act was the proposition that States that have a system, taxpayer, you pay now, you sue for a refund later."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2391.666,2395.335,"That was the Paradigm case, I think, is an accurate way to describe that."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2403.857,2413.063,"Well, Congress wrote a statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess, levy, and collect."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2452.69,2458.777,"Well, in the pizza context, I think it would be unlikely to use those technical terms."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2495.117,2502.121,"Well, let's say we're back in -- we're in the pre-internet era and I order something over the phone from an out-of-State vendor."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2540.579,2547.368,The vendor has assessed it simply by informing them that they have to pay the tax?
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2547.368,2547.802,Yes.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2547.802,2551.887,"I wouldn't say they've assessed the tax, no."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2551.887,2554.572,"Well, that's -- that's what you're arguing here, isn't it?"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2554.572,2555.306,I don't think so.
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2555.306,2556.008,That's exactly what happens.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2556.008,2561.242,The State's law is the means by which it can assess the tax.
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2585.36,2591.264,"You would say that by saying that, making that illegal statement, they've enjoined the -- the payment of the tax?"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2591.264,2591.797,"No, I wouldn't say it."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2593.231,2594.883,They have restrained it?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2594.883,2595.233,--Yes.
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.369,2601.453,Restrain means impede?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2601.453,2603.838,"Well, what the Court has said--"
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.838,2606.773,Isn't restrained a synonym for impede?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2626.485,2635.96,--The Court has used the words interrupt the assessment or collection of the tax to -- the practical effect of suspending it during the litigation.
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2638.11,2649.8,"Well, so let's say the law says not only do you have to notify the people at the point of sale on the internet, but it must be in inch-high type so they're sure to see it."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2659.158,2662.693,If the challenge is only to the size of the font requirement?
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.693,2671.483,"Well, I mean, you -- you can make light of it if you like, but they're more likely to notice it if it's there glaring them in the face as opposed to a little footnote at the bottom along with the all the other--"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2671.483,2674.768,Well -- and there are regulations of that sort with this law and that's--
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2674.768,2677.303,--And that restrains the collection of the tax?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2677.303,2683.373,--If you don't -- it restrains the means of assessment and collection of the tax under State law.
2014.13-1032,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.864,2726.55,Your argument is at least intentioned with this Court's decision in Hibbs.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2746.031,2757.005,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think what Hibbs was about was that that case did not interfere with the collection -- the State's revenue collection mechanisms."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2785.422,2790.576,"--Well, I'm not quite sure that you're addressing the essence of Hibbs."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2820.245,2822.097,"I don't agree with that, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.018,2880.8,It's the means of what -- let's posit a State law that requires all taxpayers to use only a single bank because it will be -- one bank named by the State because it will be easier to levy upon all -- upon all accounts.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2913.105,2929.38,"Well, I think the -- that the test that's been developed and has proven workable for decades in the circuit courts, none of them have rejected, is the question would be is the purpose of that law, the assessment or collection of taxes--"
2014.13-1032,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.38,2929.63,"Yes, it is."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2930.68,2949.794,"--and is the likely effect -- if the whole reason that that law was passed was to improve the assessment or collection of the tax, then it would -- then the Tax Injunction Act would allow that challenge to be brought in State court that the State courts have proven themselves able to."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2959.95,2967.09,"Well, you're disavowing then our pointing to in Hibbs the Second Circuit case."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,2983.532,2994.407,"--I think the Court -- I think the Court, looking at Wells, can make a distinction based on the fact that in that case the State had given up on assessing or collecting the taxes."
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3013.803,3027.211,"I don't want to miss the question that we started at the beginning of your brother's argument, which was the consents below issue."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3027.211,3027.728,--Right.
2014.13-1032,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3027.728,3041.221,Why was it that until your briefing here you have been arguing that the TIA did not apply or were not challenging the analysis by your adversary?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3041.221,3043.406,It was just -- it was a mistake.
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3048.308,3056.23,"I guess Federal law is the same because we have the, what is it, the AIA, the Anti-Injunction Act."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3087.016,3093.753,"Well, Justice Breyer, under the AIA, the challenge provisions are fairly complicated."
2014.13-1032,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.188,3096.838,"No, no, I'm not interested in State now."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3109.531,3114.683,"--Well, Congress has used the word “ collection ” -- “ assessment ”, “ levy ” and “ collection ”."
2014.13-1032,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3135.43,3161.248,"It seems to me that you have to distinguish some of the hypotheticals, say, from Justice Scalia about the computer being used to expedite tax collection or the bank by saying that what we have here is an information device that's so closely linked in the ordinary course to the collection of taxes that it's collect -- but I -- I--"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3161.248,3161.981,You could certainly--
2014.13-1032,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3161.981,3167.652,--I don't know how you would formulate that test and I'm not quite sure how you'd get it out of the statute.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3167.652,3175.073,"--Well, so the -- the lower courts again have -- have had more experience with this, particularly under the AIA."
2014.13-1032,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3189.75,3192.935,But don't you have to do that in order to distinguish those hypotheticals?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3193.502,3195.821,"--Well, certainly yes."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3220.869,3227.525,"Before your time expires, what's your best formulation of the connection that you think is required?"
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3227.525,3235.712,"--Well, I think the lower courts have said two things: One, the purpose again has to be assessment and collection."
2014.13-1032,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.522,3255.359,The likely effect culminating in collection just seems to me that it benefits collection in some way.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3255.359,3280.743,"--Well, so there is a -- a case cited, Bell South, that -- that addresses this and says if the law is something that doesn't interfere between the relationship between the taxing authority and the taxed individual or entity, that then the link may have been broken."
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3294.651,3296.519,"No, it doesn't prohibit you from doing that at all."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3296.519,3299.971,It prohibits us from using the tool provided under State law.
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.971,3304.192,"Well, yes, it prohibits you from doing what you want to do but the whole question is whether you can do it."
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3321.987,3327.472,"Well, it does -- I would dispute that it -- that it doesn't interfere with the relationship."
2014.13-1032,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3346.702,3351.187,But that -- the question -- this is just a forum question; right?
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3351.187,3351.589,--That's right.
2014.13-1032,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3351.589,3352.973,You can sue in Federal court.
2014.13-1032,1,20762,daniel_d_domenico,,3359.027,3372.503,"Well, that question, under the AIA or under the TIA, has to be in State court where it is right now being litigated by the same parties, the same claims."
2014.13-1032,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.805,3378.121,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1032,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3380.357,3384.661,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-1032,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3558.222,3560.257,How successful are any of those methods?
2014.13-1032,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3573.417,3578.969,"--In regard to what the State of Colorado does with its own taxpayers, its own residents, it's free to do so."
2014.13-1032,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3635.056,3642.561,Could I just ask you to clarify your position on the State's alleged consent to this suit?
2014.13-1032,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3661.106,3661.956,I believe we have.
