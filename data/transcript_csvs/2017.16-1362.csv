2017.16-1362,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.6,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1362, Encino Motorcars versus Navarro. Mr. Clement."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.6,45.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Service advisors are salespeople primarily engaged in servicing automobiles. Service advisors are plainly salespeople, and what they sell and what they are primarily engaged in is the servicing of automobiles. Thus, Respondents and the nation's 100,000 service advisors come within the literal disjunctive text of the FLSA exemption for any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements. That is --"
2017.16-1362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,45.04,61.08,"Is -- is there any other category that -- the statute lists three categories: Salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics. And you say the service advisor is -- should fit under salesmen."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,69.56,78.76,"There -- there is, Justice Ginsburg, if what you mean is sort of an occupation that was well understood at the time that Congress passed this exemption in 1966."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,113.28,114.64,Mr. Clement --
2017.16-1362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,114.64,115.24,How about --
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,115.24,116.76,-- you said the literal meaning.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,165.76,186.04,"Well, Your Honor, I mean, I'd love to talk to you about some of the other arguments you seem to like better, but let me try to push back a little bit on this one, which is I'm the -- be the first to admit that servicing in some statutes can have a relatively narrow compass and includes only, you know, essentially turning the wrenches yourself. But in other contexts, it can have a broader meaning, supplying the service, providing the service."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,210.68,243.12,"So I -- that is one of the better arguments, I think, is what -- what ""partsman"" is doing in this, but I think I'm still suggesting, before we get on to that, that if you took partsman out of this statute, I don't really think that you'd have a leg to stand on here, that we would just naturally mean, well, servicing automobiles is like fixing them. And what -- and the service providers, they have something to do with servicing, to be sure, but they're not doing the servicing. What they're doing is selling service products."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,243.12,247.84,"Well, Your Honor, I think if ""partsman"" were not in the statute, I would have a weaker argument."
2017.16-1362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.32,283.32,"But if we look -- if we look, Mr. Clement, at how partsmen got in there, I mean, there is the legislative history that Senator Bayh said the partsmen are woken up at 4 in the morning because some piece of farm equipment needs to be repaired."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,311.24,313.84,"Well, it does more than use the general title, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,377.16,397.64,"One of the amicus briefs talks about what partsmen did historically and makes the case that what partsmen did when this statute was passed is a little bit different from what -- or a lot different from what a partsman does now, in the sense that when this statute was passed, there were not readily available, ready-made, off-the-shelf parts."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,415.36,418.32,"Justice Kagan, I know there's an amicus brief that says that."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,489.8,500.52,So can I try a hypothetical on you? And the hypothetical statute is designed to match this one in structure and -- and -- and to present the same question.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,537.12,545.96,"I'm not sure I would, Your Honor, but I think there are reasons for that, which is I think making dresses is a narrower term, frankly, than servicing."
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.6,559.68,That is exactly why I've -- I was interested.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,635.56,637.2,"Well, Justice Breyer, there's a couple of things."
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.2,642.44,Yeah.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,642.44,644.24,-- not a three-to-two correspondence.
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.52,655.84,Yeah.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,655.84,662.2,"Now, I think often that's because the matching really excludes the other cases or produces a null set."
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.56,679.76,"No, no."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,680.2,680.84,"But, Mr. Clement --"
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.84,688.48,"But then you go to her second point, which the second point was: What about the purposes as Congress reveals them?"
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,688.48,688.76,Could we --
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.76,690.52,You can see in -- in the -- sorry?
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,690.52,691.8,Could I ask your indulgence --
2017.16-1362,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.8,692.0,Yeah.
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.0,703.8,"-- and just before you talk to -- about purposes? Just, you know, my -- what my hypothetical was designed to do, and I came up with a bunch of them and I'll spare you -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,703.8,705.12,Thank you.
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,705.12,707.44,-- is to have a three-to-two correspondence.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,750.92,768.4,"But, Justice Kagan, and I -- I want to try to get back to the purpose of questions, but I do think that the degree of stretching you have to do to get partsmen in is not a significant difference between how much stretching you have to do to get the service advisors in. And I think that's really the key."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,774.6,776.08,Now you're daring me. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,776.08,784.6,"Well, no, no, but -- but -- but I take it that because you really thought there was a big gap between the designers and the salespeople in terms of the stretching."
2017.16-1362,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,801.76,802.12,"Mr. Clement, one --"
2017.16-1362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.12,841.4,"Well, why can't you say that this -- the partsmen, they're exempt because Congress put them there specifically and you don't have to match them with anything. Congress may have been overbroad because they started with the farm equipment people. So, if we just look at the two others, why should we stretch service advisor to come within the mechanic who's actually servicing when we know that the service advisor doesn't even possess the skills to be engaged in servicing?"
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,841.4,860.96,"So, Justice Ginsburg, I don't -- I don't think the service advisor is differently situated from the partsman in terms of having the skills to go under the hood and turn the wrenches himself or herself. I think, as to the answer to your question about why don't we just say, hey, the partsmen are in because the partsmen are in, because the structure of the statute doesn't let you say just the partsmen are in."
2017.16-1362,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,898.8,911.24,"Do you have an example of a partsman that is not engaged in servicing automobiles, say a partsman in another office and he -- downtown from the dealership, and he just picks up the phone and orders parts or something?"
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,911.24,911.48,Sure.
2017.16-1362,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,945.48,965.44,"Well, I -- I wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your argument that there's been decades of reliance. If we want to adopt that argument and say, well, there's been reliance here, it's a close question, we're not sure, it's ambiguous, what case do I cite to show that reliance bears on the interpretation of the statute?"
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,965.44,1000.84,"I think you'd cite -- among other things, you could cite the Christopher case, the Christopher against SmithKline case, which is another FLSA case. And this Court averted to the reliance interest both in deciding not to apply our deference but also in interpreting the statute. And I think the principle isn't, you know, well, if for four decades people have got it wrong, we'll get it wrong. I -- I think the principle is, you know, as -- as the -- as the Seventh Circuit said in the Yi case, which Christopher cited, I mean, it's -- it's no mean feat to conclude that an agency has been in open, notorious violation of the FLSA for four decades. And I think the behavior of the industry is some evidence of what those terms meant."
2017.16-1362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.84,1008.28,"The agency, as I understand it, the agency gave up after two circuits rejected its position."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1031.84,1045.84,"Well, it's -- I think that the issue, I'm happy to discuss that, that's the Portal-to-Portal Act affirmative defense, I think our reliance on that is even more complicated now because it doesn't just allow for no damages when you've relied on the agency in the abstract."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1119.16,1135.0,"When I think of these three categories of workers, so service providers, partsmen, mechanics, to coin a couple of silly kind of words, a service advisor is customer-facing."
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1173.36,1184.48,"Well, Your Honor, a couple of things. First of all, you probably anticipate that I'm going to take you back to the partsmen again because I do think describing the partsmen as just vehicle-facing really misdescribes what they do."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1256.12,1267.64,"Is -- is everybody who's in a service department -- does everybody count as primarily engaged in servicing automobiles who's in a service department, the receptionist, the filers?"
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1267.64,1270.72,The answer is I'm not sure.
2017.16-1362,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1294.68,1296.44,What about an automobile upholsterer?
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1296.44,1307.0,"Again, I would say that that's somebody who might be primarily engaged in servicing, but they wouldn't be covered because they're not a mechanic, they're not a partsman, and they're not a salesperson."
2017.16-1362,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1307.0,1308.2,How about if the service advisor --
2017.16-1362,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1308.2,1314.84,What -- what role do -- what role do the -- the three objects at the end of the sentence play in your interpretation? We haven't discussed those yet.
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1314.84,1324.56,"Well, I -- I hope they play this role, Your Honor, which is I think it's common ground among -- between the parties that those are distributed to each other noun/gerund combination."
2017.16-1362,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1390.8,1392.48,What about our narrow construction canon?
2017.16-1362,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1392.48,1394.96,"Well, that's an interesting question, Your Honor."
2017.16-1362,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1518.16,1525.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1525.32,1553.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The exemption in this case is for any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles. The most obvious reason why or the clearest reason why service advisors don't come within that exemption is they don't service automobiles. In our brief, we cite five -- I think the five most authoritative dictionaries of the English language, and they define ""service"" -- ""to service"" as to maintain or repair."
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.84,1587.64,"Well, I guess sometimes, though, I mean, they do look under the hood sometimes, right? You bring the car up, you know, it's making this noise, they go out and at least listen to the noise, and sometimes they can say right away: Oh, that's probably this."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1609.28,1616.68,"I -- I don't think so. I mean, actually, I think what the advisor does is make a guess, but really -- of what might be wrong based on what the customer says."
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.8,1626.04,Suppose --
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.04,1627.08,That's a different -- that's a different example.
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1627.08,1628.36,-- finds something.
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1629.72,1638.2,"Sometimes -- I -- I guess what I'm saying, sometimes the primary decision in servicing the car is going to be made by the service advisor, at least the initial thing."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1648.96,1657.4,"Yeah, I -- I think actually the service advisor's job -- they may make a guess as to what's wrong and give the customer -- say, well, it might be the distributor cap."
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.2,1666.44,Suppose the service advisor meets the customer in the morning and he said: I'm a service advisor.
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1673.68,1675.8,"I -- well, actually, I don't think so."
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.28,1683.8,"Well, how about to arrange for?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1683.8,1686.96,"Yes, I think it is correct to say they arrange for it."
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1689.48,1693.28,"But if -- if that's true, it seems to me he's engaged in servicing the automobile."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1693.28,1700.96,"No, I don't think so because I -- I think there's a huge difference, as a matter of -- he's definitely not servicing the automobile just because he's arranging for it."
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.12,1747.0,"But if they -- but if they picked out the color and -- and -- and advised all about the quality of the paint, paint to use, and different costs, and scheduled the timing and so forth, I think they could be -- they could be supervising the painting of the house."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1747.0,1752.52,"Well, I mean, actually supervising service -- supervising a repair also isn't the same thing as repairing."
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.76,1795.28,"Well, but, I mean, just in -- and maybe this isn't the best guide to the interpretation, but it's sort of common understanding if you, over several years, dropped your car off whenever you're supposed to or whenever it's broken and -- and you talk to Fred about getting it fixed, and -- and somebody comes to you later and says something -- I've got a problem with my car, you would say my service guy is Fred, go see him. It's just sort of your general reaction is that is part of the service -- not only that, it's the part, the only part that you have experience with."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1798.12,1799.12,I -- I --
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.12,1799.64,-- no?
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1799.64,1800.92,I -- I would just respectfully disagree.
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.56,1803.64,"It's different, go to different shops, I guess?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1803.64,1806.76,I -- I think you would -- I think you would think of Fred as the person you give the car to.
2017.16-1362,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.92,1814.64,You can read it that way.
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1823.44,1825.44,"""Involved in"" would bring it much closer and actually --"
2017.16-1362,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.44,1826.08,"Yeah, it would."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1872.8,1872.84,No.
2017.16-1362,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.84,1878.16,"Now, suppose I -- suppose -- suppose I -- I think, gee, I don't know the answer to this question."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1909.32,1910.96,"Yeah, I do. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1910.96,1924.68,"In the first place, if you look at the -- if you look at the car dealership, it's not the case that there are three main people in the car dealership: The salesmen, the partsmen, and the mechanics. There's salesmen who sell financing, insurance, and warranties."
2017.16-1362,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.04,1968.84,"Well, if the mechanics are in there because they did call farmers at 2 in the morning, did the service advisor call the farmer too?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1968.84,1971.72,There's -- as far as I know in the history of the auto industry --
2017.16-1362,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1971.72,1972.2,No?
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1972.2,1979.56,"-- there's never been an example of a service advisor who worked off site and probably very rarely, if ever, irregular hours."
2017.16-1362,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.76,2017.64,"How about that Congress got it wrong in what they perceived the partsman job was? They were right about the partsmen who work on farm equipment, but they were wrong about the partsman who works on automobiles, who works regular hours."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2017.64,2018.48,I don't think they were wrong.
2017.16-1362,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2036.76,2052.28,"But your definition of servicing, which I think is a very natural one, I mean, and not just, you know, natural, it's the dictionary definition of servicing, but it has to cope with this partsmen word. How does -- how do partsmen fit within your definition of servicing?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2052.28,2052.36,Okay.
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.96,2107.2,"Well, but diagnosis is part of the servicing as well, and the service advisors at least do that."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2138.08,2144.2,"I -- I think actually the -- the relevant question is, is he or she providing the treatment? And I would say no. They're giving an initial guess."
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.2,2146.76,"No, no, the statute talks about being engaged in."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2151.0,2152.68,I don't think he's engaged in treating.
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2154.84,2155.8,I guess maybe it's the --
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.8,2161.28,But the dictionary definition of engaged says to do or take part in something.
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2161.28,2162.36,Right.
2017.16-1362,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2286.84,2315.48,"Mr. Feldman, when -- when you talked about the purposes, you focused on the fact that service advisors work on-site and don't work irregular hours. I believe that Mr. Clement's argument, and he'll correct me if I'm wrong, focuses on the fact of commissions, that these people, like other kinds of salesmen and like mechanics, are often compensated through commission schemes. What about that?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2315.48,2320.04,I -- I think that commissions are actually completely irrelevant to this provision.
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.6,2451.64,"Well, could you add to that, or correct me if I'm wrong, that in the two circuit cases that ruled against the FLSA, the government had taken the opposite position?"
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2451.64,2452.6,That's right.
2017.16-1362,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.08,2551.28,"Mr. -- Mr. Feldman, I -- I don't understand from what you said whether you are disagreeing with me that there would be no retroactive liability because employers relied in good faith on what had been the agency's position."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2551.28,2562.68,"The -- I -- I agree with you that would -- there could be good-faith reliance that -- in this case, I think there would be good-faith reliance up until 2011. Then the complaint here was filed in 2012."
2017.16-1362,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2607.4,2615.4,"Mr. Feldman, the Solicitor General is not here in a case in which one would expect the government to be here."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2622.16,2624.84,I don't know.
2017.16-1362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2719.68,2732.84,"Well, but if -- if you have a service advisor in the morning and then a different one in the afternoon, that's a completely different -- changed dynamic from the same person saying we found a little problem and we went ahead and did X, Y, or whatever."
2017.16-1362,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2732.84,2736.88,"Well, I mean, I -- I just would say: one is, that does happen sometimes."
2017.16-1362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3112.52,3117.08,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Clement."
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3117.08,3121.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just a few points in rebuttal."
2017.16-1362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3172.56,3214.76,"Mr. Clement, how -- Mr. Clement, your new definition, your more expansive definition, tell me how many more people that are involved in the service department will be covered. Will it include the dispatchers who tell people -- who don't do anything but assign the work, or the lubesmen, the upholsterers, the -- all those other people who right now for 40 years, or more or less, have been paid a salary, are they now going to be subject to automobile dealerships saying: Given this new definition, we can forego paying them minimum wages?"
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3214.76,3218.2,"No, Justice Sotomayor. We're here -- we're on the status quo team."
2017.16-1362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3219.64,3221.44,"Well, that's very nice, but tell me -- but your definition --"
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3221.44,3221.92,"Sure, sure."
2017.16-1362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3221.92,3225.56,-- your definition might very well include them --
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3225.56,3226.04,It might --
2017.16-1362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3226.04,3229.88,-- because you're basically saying anybody involved in servicing is covered.
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3229.88,3232.48,"No, that's where -- that's where, with all due respect, you're wrong."
2017.16-1362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3342.84,3355.4,Were the two circuits that ruled in favor of the employees -- was -- was that within the 40-year period? Didn't the agency take the position in -- in those two cases that --
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3355.4,3356.36,"That, Justice Kennedy --"
2017.16-1362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3356.36,3356.88,-- they were not covered?
2017.16-1362,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3356.88,3358.88,-- is really what starts the 40 years of reliance.
2017.16-1362,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3415.36,3416.08,"Thank you, counsel."
