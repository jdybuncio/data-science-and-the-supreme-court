1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.317,1998.133,"There was an allegation, however, in his pleading that --"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1998.133,2007.995,"There is an allegation in the pleading, but the nature of the transaction is such that it is not susceptible to monetary evaluation."
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2020.884,2027.544,Two years of military pay as contrasted with two years income as a physician (Voice Overlap)?
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2027.544,2044.356,Two years of military pay as a physician is considerably higher than two years of military pay as a first class private and this man would have gone in the service as a Commissioned Officer with pay and allowances and besides I am not sure that is the proper measure â€“-
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.356,2044.98,"Well, I am not either."
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2045.794,2047.98,in a case such as this.
1971.70-58,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.297,2068.514,"Mr. Solicitor, how about Hague against the CIO?"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2068.514,2069.159,How about --
1971.70-58,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2069.159,2071.737,Hague against CIO?
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2071.737,2087.965,"In that case, the majority of the Court claimed, (Voice Overlap) they made it clear that it was not proceeding under this Section because it felt that the jurisdictional amount could not be there and it found a way to proceed under another Section which is not available here."
1971.70-58,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2465.924,2475.859,"In the 1971 Amendment, was any effort made to change the rule in that case?"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2475.859,2505.504,"No Mr. Justice, the only substantive amendment in the Draft Act that was made or at least the only one that is anywhere near that, near this case is the addition of Section 22 at end which contains these provisions which Mr. Standard referred to and to which I plan to make a reference a little later in my argument."
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.504,2508.009,But 10 (b) (3) was the statutory enactment --
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2508.009,2510.14,10 (b) (3) is an unchanged.
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2758.252,2760.298,But the Court of Appeals had held so?
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2760.298,2777.033,"And the Court of Appeals not in the Breen case, yes, Mr. Justice in the course of the Breen case, the Court of Appeals had made that --"
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.033,2777.599,Had finally --
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2777.599,2779.111,-- had made that distinction.
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.844,2914.873,"Can you tell us again briefly Mr. Solicitor General what was the underlying legal issue in that case, I have the (Voice Overlap)?"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2914.873,2916.186,In Boyd against Clark?
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2916.186,2917.503,"Yes, in Boyd against Clark?"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2917.503,2944.846,It was the question with respect to discrimination against non-student with economic undertones involved in it which is a question of due process and equal protection which is not unrelated to the procedural due process which is referred to as hearing.
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.846,2962.208,"Now do I understand that as of today, if the State Director took an appeal as happened this case that there would be notice and an opportunity where personal appearance before the State Appeal Board under the new statute?"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2962.208,2963.949,Under the new statute there would.
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2968.006,2983.452,"Alright, but let us assume that he would have a right to a personal appearance before the State Appeal Board and then let us assume that today a case come up like this one where he was denied a personal appearance."
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3013.945,3023.071,"Well Mr. Justice, I have not had any chance to think about this in advance, but I think I would."
1971.70-58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.956,3054.896,But if it weren't barred by 10 (b) (3) then it probably would not be barred in this case either if there was unconstitutional requirement?
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3054.896,3073.016,"I agree Mr. Justice and let me reiterate that we are not suggesting that Mr. Fein cannot present his issues before a proper court at a proper time, in a completely impartial court at a proper time."
1971.70-58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3085.001,3092.187,"You mean a proper court at a proper time, I gather (Inaudible) the suggestion can either be 8 (b) (4) (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-58,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3092.187,3107.202,"Or in defense of a criminal prosecution and I agree that's a difficult place, but it is a full day in Court before an impartial judicial tribunal."
