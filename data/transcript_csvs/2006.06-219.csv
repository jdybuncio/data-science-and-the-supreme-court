2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.686,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,7.858,14.089,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,21.226,23.163,"Mr. Garre, could you crank up the thing?"
2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,26.677,28.786,I think it needs a little upcranking.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,29.145,30.238,--Hopefully that's better.
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.037,102.163,"General Garre, there's a record here that the district court said there was substantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on this man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray, videotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the grazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the Bureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,111.768,119.312,"Justice Ginsburg, there are a number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent this alleged conduct and that he did invoke."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.981,133.243,"Well, what is, what is there that will really be effective, because if you tell me challenging each citation for violating the grazing permit--"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,133.243,139.522,He can challenge the citations for challenging the... canceling the grazing permits--
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.522,144.037,--And then the behavior will continue and he'll get one more and one more and one more.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,144.037,147.814,"--Well, I don't think that that's a reasonable inference, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.375,157.358,May I ask a quick question.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,186.471,195.374,"Well, our position is that he hasn't established a constitutional tort or an actionable claim under RICO."
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.374,195.717,I know that.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,195.717,199.388,"To answer your question, the Government takes these types of allegations seriously."
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.213,223.301,"Because if this, if this continues, your argument... and I understand your argument that there's no essential free-standing cause of action for damages... basically means he has a right to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each individual incursion, each individual wrong."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.216,245.245,"Well that's exactly what he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a five-year period."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,245.245,251.554,But we know from the decisions of the IBLA that he did challenge that they rejected the grounds that he--
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.554,252.804,"They may be wrong, too."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,278.013,284.416,"--Well, Justice Scalia, to bring an APA action to Federal court challenging the final decisions of the IBLA."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.416,285.65,That's one by one.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,307.625,316.122,"Again, I think you have to assume that his claims would not succeed either at the administrative level or at the APA level, and if he got--"
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.122,316.716,I don't assume that at all.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,330.008,334.959,"--Well, if there's a trespass he can go, he can obtain an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.722,350.139,What... the photographing of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and they pay him for that.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,357.902,361.182,"Well, he claimed that they were trespassing on his lands."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.182,362.792,Let's assume they wasn't trespassing.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,362.792,382.862,"Well, he'd raised that objection before the IBLA and the IBLA concluded, and we think reasonably, that, given the history of the disputes with this individual, given his litigious nature, that it was reasonable for the BLM officials who were out there to be documenting his trespasses on public lands, and that's an important dimension of this case."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.862,393.184,"I thought there was one aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the Government was doing it on its own land, on public land."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,401.244,413.613,"To document, to document his trespasses on other lands, and that's... the citation to the IBLA decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief and it discusses that allegation in depth."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.504,438.698,"I would really like to have your answer to my opening question, and I said: If your only answer is each time something, he is charged by the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,450.147,455.411,"--He does not have a remedy under the Just Compensation Clause or Bivens, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.411,457.035,"What does, what does he have?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,457.035,463.297,"He can challenge, he can challenge these actions under the administrative process available to him under the--"
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.297,464.282,--Piecemeal.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,464.282,464.657,--APA--
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,464.657,465.328,Piecemeal.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,465.328,467.421,--like any number of other contexts.
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.421,470.467,Does he have any action that is other than piecemeal?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,470.467,474.262,He has to challenge each administrative action--
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.262,475.699,I take it the answer is no.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,475.699,476.356,--that he claims is unlawful.
2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,476.356,478.901,Were any of these administrative actions found to be unfounded?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,482.447,483.195,He did not.
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.923,503.47,I'm surprised you say piecemeal.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,510.044,510.419,And they do.
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,510.419,521.306,"You can write them a letter and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I want you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to do something about it."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,527.818,528.99,"It has, Justice Breyer."
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.568,530.849,And what's been the result of that?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,530.849,542.624,"The result of that is it was determined that these actions by these line officers of the Bureau of Land Management were perfectly appropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has systematically violated the permits and conditions that are found--"
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.624,547.811,"Who made that, who made that determination, including the selective citations?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,547.811,553.948,"--I believe there was an inspector general investigation, investigation within the Department of Interior that--"
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.948,561.883,I thought the Department of Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they told the line people at BLM to stop.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,561.883,567.068,"--There was a settlement agreement, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.722,578.705,"Nonetheless, they did enter a settlement which included that this behavior was going to stop."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,578.705,581.22,"--Well, I'm not sure that that's a fair characterization."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.089,611.895,"Would you agree at least to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the district court said on summary judgment, there was sufficient evidence to go to a trial."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,625.091,628.605,"--This Court has to accept those factual allegations, to--"
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.605,628.824,Okay.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,629.277,629.902,--to be sure.
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,631.229,632.151,--So that's the case we have.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,639.164,651.628,"--That's a fulsome remedy, Justice Ginsburg, when you think of the claims that could be brought administratively under the Administrative Procedures Act, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, to receive damages, to receive injunctions--"
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.628,659.0,"What damages would you get for the trespass of a... one, one BLM agent on your land?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,671.402,681.287,"--If the allegation is that these trespasses have in effect deprived me of my property which is my business, then conceivably he could make a request for a large amount of damages."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.287,685.958,He doesn't say it deprived him of his property which is his business.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,685.958,687.004,"No, I think--"
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.004,688.754,He is saying it's a trespass; get off my land.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,688.754,691.596,"--He, he has made both claims, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.475,718.991,Can he get injunctive relief?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,737.124,738.764,--Certainly he could under the APA.
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.261,754.694,"--He can bring, he can bring this, he could bring this not one action at a time, but he could complain all at once about everything?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,754.694,761.989,"Well, the other thing to keep in mind is that many of these discrete administrative actions... for example, take the cancellation of the permits."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,786.385,790.821,He could... he could not go into a Federal court with a Federal question?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,796.568,803.41,"--He would have to exhaust his administrative remedies, just like any number of other people who believe that they have been wronged by the Federal Government."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.41,806.768,Part of his claim is... is selective enforcement.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,842.785,846.206,"Well, the I... let me answer that in two ways."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.045,858.06,Was that because the Government was entitled to the reciprocal easement?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,859.481,860.044,Well--
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.044,863.152,It wasn't extortion because he should have given the easement.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,863.152,863.652,--No.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.612,893.873,"Not after, not after they have already given away... I mean, yes; they could come to him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us this easement we'll give you yet another one."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,893.873,894.529,That's true.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.529,905.931,"But he had one in, from the past, which... which his predecessor had given a reciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,905.931,906.868,That's true.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.21,916.88,And they're mad at him for not giving back that easement which they failed to record.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,916.88,924.486,The BLM doesn't have to stop enforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses to enter into reciprocal arrangements.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.859,928.172,It wouldn't be reciprocal.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,937.62,944.088,"A valuable right-of-way, Justice Scalia, that... that was for 30 years, that covered 14 miles of public road--"
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.088,945.197,--But that's what his predecessor had.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.197,946.056,He had that already.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,946.056,949.54,"--Well, but that did not convey with the property."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.645,957.488,I did not... I did not understand that.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,957.488,958.223,Absolutely.
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.435,974.044,"As originally negotiated, with I think Nelson."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,978.215,985.43,The right-of-way was for 30 years which was long than the 20-year easement that the Government got in exchange.
2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,993.161,1000.267,"Counsel, I... I think part of what's happening here is there is difference between the regulation on the books and how they are enforced."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1025.977,1030.801,"Well, first I don't think it gives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just Compensation Clause."
2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.723,1035.33,So that he can't... but you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1043.219,1049.778,"--Then I, then I don't think he is a very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he is entitled to violate BLM rules or regulations."
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.832,1073.44,"Well, why is it a State law matter?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1091.246,1092.668,--I think he was on notice.
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.726,1105.834,That's a given in the record.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1112.002,1122.249,"--But in any event, the point is that the BLM recognized that it had to negotiate a new reciprocal arrangement with Respondent and it sought to do so."
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.249,1127.934,--And it's trying to cover for its own sloppiness or carelessness in not recording--
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1127.934,1134.416,"Well, it, it's trying to seek, establish a new reciprocal arrangement."
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.694,1145.397,Can I ask you about the Bivens theory here before your time runs out?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1150.144,1153.204,"I, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.308,1179.757,Well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1198.218,1198.749,Well... two points.
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.551,1230.721,Suppose we think... suppose we disagree with you on the latter point.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1238.624,1239.123,I--
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.123,1241.248,To expand... it would be an expansion of Bivens.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1241.248,1249.823,--It would be closer to it but the Court would still have to confront the question of whether it would be appropriate to infer a constitutional tort under the Just Compensation Clause.
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.105,1291.494,"If a... including, you know, busting into his lodge and disrupting the furniture and all of that, they thought that that was probably--"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1291.494,1292.025,"--Well, if that's true--"
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.025,1292.68,--probably allowed?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1292.68,1298.552,"--If that's... they would be on notice, that that conduct if true could subject them to a tort action under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2006.06-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.701,1318.248,Is that a test for... for... for qualified immunity?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1321.153,1321.715,You have to have--

2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1329.728,1330.93,--Yes.
2006.06-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1342.613,1348.142,So you're suggesting they would not be immune from a State law trespass action?
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1348.142,1348.72,--No.
2006.06-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.234,1356.809,The people who had done this--
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.809,1359.059,--But the Federal Tort Claims Act is against the United States.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1360.027,1363.822,It's against the United States if they are acting within the scope of their conduct.
2006.06-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.587,1371.633,--But then it wouldn't be a Federal Tort Claims Act.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1371.633,1375.803,"--Well, then it would be additional suits in State court."
2006.06-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1382.847,1393.686,"But respect to the RICO claim, assuming the RICO claim is upheld, what do you say to your brother's argument that there is no history of qualified immunity for RICO claims?"
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1404.885,1406.01,"--Two things, Justice Souter."
2006.06-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.729,1450.71,"Well that may be a very... it seems to me that those may be good arguments, or at least relevant arguments against the applicability of RICO in the first place."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1459.019,1459.488,I don't--
2006.06-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1459.488,1462.159,"--to, to apply it to a RICO defendant."

2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1503.455,1513.154,"--Well, no, because we don't think that there's a violation of the Just Compensation Clause when someone doesn't take property, when someone doesn't act through allegedly--"
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.154,1515.09,That's a different... that's a different reason.

2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.15,1520.369,--Yeah.
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1522.414,1524.227,"Well, we think that qualified immunity now--"
2006.06-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1524.227,1525.085,"No, I'm not even thinking of it."
2006.06-219,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1532.849,1539.236,"--No, because there has been no violation of the substantive Fifth Amendment right and there has been no violation of Bivens."

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1586.655,1620.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is a dramatic contrast between the instantaneous judgments a school principal might have to make in the face of complicated decisions like Tinker, and a deliberate decision over a course of almost a dozen years made by officials of the Bureau of Land Management that the greater retaliate against someone for refusing to relinquish his property to the government without any compensation."
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.606,1633.027,"Mr. Tribe, can I get something straight?"

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1664.608,1665.639,--The government is wrong.
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.028,1667.903,That's how I understood it.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1667.903,1669.839,"It ran with the land, it was part of what he brought."
2006.06-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.417,1673.213,This is the easement over the roadway.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1673.213,1675.899,--The right-of-way over the government's roads.
2006.06-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1675.899,1676.868,As opposed to the grazing easement.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1676.868,1677.931,As... that's right.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.895,1695.407,"If they finally canceled it, how did it... I mean, if it runs with the land, they don't have the authority to cancel."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1695.407,1699.311,They didn't have the authority to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land.

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1740.25,1740.982,Right.
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.982,1743.076,--And the system of lands out there can't work without it.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1743.076,1743.622,Uh-huh.

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1757.367,1757.789,--I wouldn't either.

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1775.781,1776.311,That's right.
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.311,1777.718,--for him to cough up--
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1777.718,1779.138,To cough up that easement.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.494,1833.336,Who would have thought... wait.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1839.49,1840.006,--Sure.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.006,1843.63,"Well, if they are plainly illegal, then there are remedies in the courts."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1843.63,1846.081,There are remedies one by one for each of these acts.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.081,1846.3,All right.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1857.733,1859.075,"Well, the remedies were acquittal."
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1860.309,1861.184,"Well, maybe he didn't do it."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1861.184,1864.292,He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.292,1866.667,"And so it may be, they thought he did do it and--"
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1866.667,1867.12,"No, no."
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.042,1868.917,--All right.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1868.917,1869.135,He alleged--
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.135,1871.009,Did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1871.009,1875.46,--That's part of... this is a suite like Hartman v. Moore.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.953,1891.421,All right.

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1906.197,1906.728,--He tried to do that.
2006.06-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1906.728,1907.556,And he lost.

2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.18,1911.539,--Maybe he should have won.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1914.367,1915.069,--I sure do.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.069,1915.569,--All right.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1988.242,2013.341,"Justice Breyer, that... that floodgates concern was addressed by this Court not long enough in Hartman v. Moore when the remedy in that case for a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against someone for the exercise of her First Amendment right was a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who made this all up."
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.47,2059.291,"You see, part of what's worrying me is that once you get into the Fifth Amendment, which is... prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2086.077,2099.104,"I see, but it was present in Davis, Davis v. Passman, to which Justice Kennedy referred, already recognized a Bivens action for violating something even more capacious, due process, equal protection."

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2135.043,2135.59,--That's correct.
2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2135.59,2145.227,"And in the brief you say that the government says that this is limited First Amendment, and then you say,"

2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.552,2170.763,"Then in page 22 and 23, you go ahead and you talk about Wisconsin versus Yoder, Lefkowitz versus Turley, Bordenkircher, which I think was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2182.773,2184.866,"But many of them are not, Justice Kennedy."

2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.331,2194.816,"Well, no."

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2220.226,2229.176,"Well, Justice Kennedy, that was a response to their claim, that only with respect to the Fifth Amendment is there a right."

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2242.36,2243.0,We can look at it.
2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.0,2243.516,That's right.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2250.199,2256.759,"In the sense that there has never been a case just like it under Hope v. Pelzer, there doesn't have to have been one like it."

2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.402,2681.321,"Well, the two cases you cite, the first one is the person who was charged with extortion is a judge--"
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2681.321,2681.914,That's right.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.914,2687.585,"--And he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, so the money wasn't given to the government."

2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.037,2695.628,"--it may have been, but you say ""See Also"", which is a sign to me there's something wrong with that case."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2697.284,2702.813,"--I don't, I don't think there is, Justice Breyer, and it's very short."
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.813,2705.765,I'm surprised that you didn't put it first if there wasn't.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2709.951,2715.526,"Well, Willett versus Devoy, it involved a clerk demanding more money than the law allowed, and the court said:"
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.394,2736.503,"Why did you say ""See Also""?"
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2736.503,2737.347,I don't remember.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2737.347,2741.625,You say this clearly establishes.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2745.514,2746.374,No.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.374,2750.857,--as clearly establishing their liability for what you call extortion?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2758.119,2764.756,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement it does trouble me."
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.487,2777.626,You agree if the case were otherwise... and I gather we have a factual dispute on that... that it would have been all right?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2786.107,2787.716,It makes all the difference in the world.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.402,2795.29,"Well, that's what I'm trying to get, to see if you agree with that."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2803.287,2808.754,"--Well, most of what they did would not have been an okay method of getting a reciprocal easement, anyway."
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.099,2847.237,"Mr. Tribe, I'll tell what you troubles me about this case."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2893.876,2902.592,Nor would Nollan have come out the same way if they weren't trying to get an easement in return for something which wasn't... which you called extortion.
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.592,2902.873,"No, no."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2909.417,2921.114,I guess the straightforward answer that I would give to your question I think is that the Constitution does guarantee that the Government cannot take your property for public use without just compensation.
2006.06-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.114,2947.059,"--The whole spectrum of possible Government misbehavior, selective enforcement, the whole spectrum, the only, the only times we're going to allow a cause of action under Bivens or under, under not 1983... yes... the only times we're going to do that is when there is a demand for property?"
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2947.059,2950.213,You've certainly done it with respect to the Eighth Amendment.
2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2953.15,2965.377,"But Professor Tribe, all these cases are cases in which there is... Nollan, you have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this is just a, this is just a constitutional defense."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3016.764,3022.573,"--Justice Kennedy, if it's an extension, it's I think implicit in Bivens' logic."
2006.06-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.104,3028.274,"Fair enough, but it's an extension of Bivens."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3028.274,3034.522,"--The Fifth Amendment is different from the First, but is it different in a relevant way?"
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3055.795,3058.934,But are they disabled from negotiating?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3078.707,3080.441,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.501,3086.5,So how many trespass--
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3086.5,3087.11,They said: We don't negotiate.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3087.11,3090.436,--citations for his cattle does it take before it's all of a sudden extortion?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3090.436,3099.808,The record in the case shows that on those very instances where he was cited with trespass others who were doing the identical thing were not.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.886,3103.605,And he challenged the citations and they were rejected.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3103.605,3107.852,--The IBLA rejected them because it said it has no jurisdiction.
2006.06-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3148.634,3159.614,So are you saying that there was therefore no way short of Bivens even to challenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective prosecution.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3159.614,3164.844,He could have taken that one item and under a decision like Hartman vindicated it.
2006.06-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.323,3194.49,"I appreciate that, but I thought you made the further claim... maybe I misunderstood it... that if he had gone from the administrative tribunal, or attempted to, to get into the district court, he could not have gotten into district court under the act."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3194.49,3197.521,"Well, he wouldn't have had... because he would have had no record."
2006.06-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3215.544,3221.37,"Could he have gone into the district court and said, I tried to make a record but they wouldn't let me; let me make a record now?"
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3222.448,3231.163,I believe the district court's jurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is limited to the agency record.
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3231.163,3231.429,"No, no."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3239.847,3245.251,So a challenge to the IBLA's assertion--
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.251,3245.594,I don't know.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3252.123,3254.122,"--Well, he did write to the Secretary of the Interior."
2006.06-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3254.122,3254.951,And what happened?
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3254.951,3257.449,He was not given an answer.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.001,3363.36,No.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3370.794,3376.198,The Westfall Act makes an exception when you are making a constitutional claim.

2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3393.894,3396.3,Mr. Chief Justice--
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.3,3396.659,You can answer.
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3398.267,3402.406,--It seems to me that state tort law does not get at the harm that he has suffered.
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3419.664,3419.961,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-219,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3419.961,3421.491,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3421.491,3423.132,"Mr. Garre, you have--"
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3425.475,3426.178,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-219,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3445.748,3446.42,They might have been lying--
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3446.67,3447.17,--Well--
2006.06-219,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.17,3448.324,--just as they lied about--
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3449.777,3462.835,"--Pointing to JA 100 which is the right-of-way, which says that in accordance with Federal regulations, and I point the Court to 43 CFR 2803, which discusses assignments and makes clear that assignments have to be approved."
2006.06-219,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3462.835,3470.863,"I thought there was something about Nelson having assigned his, the right-of-way that he had to the Government."

2006.06-219,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3474.799,3475.049,Yes.
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3484.124,3486.311,--It was never approved.
2006.06-219,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.948,3495.977,"--Well, then why did you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?"
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3495.977,3500.336,--It... it was revoked as part of the decision not to assign it.
2006.06-219,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3508.895,3509.645,--Why wouldn't there be an assignment?
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3513.035,3517.157,"In order for the right-of-way, because these are rights-of-way to public lands."
2006.06-219,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3523.937,3525.124,The prior owner did assign it.
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3527.357,3538.445,"--But, but again it's clear... and it was not approved, and one of the reasons it wasn't approved was because rents weren't paid and he wasn't agreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations which are part of the right-of-way."
2006.06-219,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3557.47,3560.764,Davis versus Passman is a different context.
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3566.559,3567.34,"No, it's not."
2006.06-219,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3584.943,3586.786,But their argument is broader.
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3606.793,3609.573,They don't have a Bivens remedy and they don't have a RICO remedy.
2006.06-219,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3625.458,3641.95,"But what do you... what do you say to the argument that... that you simply cannot follow that logic ultimately, because when you get to the point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a thousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you can stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a thousand, you're dead."
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3648.933,3656.648,I think the law and this Court reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies available to them through challenging individual--
2006.06-219,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3656.648,3659.429,Why is that a reasonable assumption in response to their argument?
2006.06-219,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3659.429,3670.626,"--It's reasonable to assume that if there are actions against United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or actions finding Government conduct unauthorized under the APA, that the Government will take action to prevent that."
2006.06-219,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3677.28,3678.39,"Thank you, Counsel."
