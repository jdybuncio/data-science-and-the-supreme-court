1989.89-189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-189, Samuel A. Lewis v. Jimmy Wayne Jeffers."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,55.218,71.144,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.791,131.366,I suppose it would be reviewable under the Jackson against Virginia standard at... at any rate if it were argued that there were no... no juror could possibly or no court could possibly find him beyond a reasonable doubt.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,131.366,135.436,That's an additional standard that the dissent in the Ninth Circuit recognized.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.27,294.674,What do you think its holding was in the Ninth Circuit?
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,294.674,300.228,"--My interpretation of the Ninth Circuit's holding was they first looked at Arizona's definition of cruel, heinous or depraved."
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.78,305.396,Uh-huh.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,305.396,309.084,They then looked at the facts and they accepted the facts... the historical facts--
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.084,309.184,Yes.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,309.184,310.767,--concerning what Mr. Jeffers had done.
1989.89-189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.247,341.721,"Well, didn't the Ninth Circuit in reaching that conclusion take into consideration other Arizona cases in which the death penalty had not been imposed?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,341.721,345.757,They looked at... they looked at six cases.
1989.89-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.882,392.488,"Now, what do you say the standard for review is for this so-called as applied challenge?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,392.488,401.76,My position is that... is that once the determination has been made that the circumstance has been narrowly defined.
1989.89-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.519,417.353,In... in what case?
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,417.353,423.673,"Barclay, Barclay versus Florida."
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.296,559.029,"May I just interrupt a second, Mr. Grant?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,577.959,591.6,"Well, I think the difference is, simply by looking at the record this Court could determine, number one, that the jury who sentenced Godfrey were not instructed on the meaning, the narrowing construction--"
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.6,591.967,Right.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,591.967,593.969,--of the meaning of the aggravating circumstance.
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.084,620.369,But as to the second point... is what I'm most interest in.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,620.369,637.331,"As to the second point, you can look at the Arizona State Supreme Court's opinion and you can see... it's in the Joint Appendix at, I believe, page 69 and following... that they refer to the narrow definition and they then proceed to apply it to Mr. Jeffers' case."
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.017,670.469,"Well, I thought the... I thought... I'm... I... it's kind of a confusing opinion."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,683.127,684.062,I think that's what they said.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.732,694.95,Under the narrow definition?
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,694.95,696.202,Correct.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.712,809.642,"Well, tell me... tell me again why... why a... why you think that the Jackson-type review to a... where... where it's been found either in the trial court or the... by the appellate court that an aggravating circumstance exists."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,818.981,822.45,I don't have a major problem with the Jackson standard.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.639,830.506,"Well, that's true."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,830.506,832.158,--in a Jackson-type standard--
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.158,836.36,"Well, what's... what's the difference between the Jackson-type standard and what you're promoting?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,836.36,839.062,--To a certain extent we're... we're discussing semantics.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.816,855.356,"Because a lot of people... a lot of people, including some maybe around here, thought there was going to be a terrific terrible result from Jackson."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,860.325,860.892,--I don't think so.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.758,905.539,"I thought the court went on to say that because the... because on these facts the circumstance doesn't exist... I thought they concluded that the circumstance therefore, as defined, wasn't... wasn't sufficiently... well, it wasn't... as applied in the courts, it was sort of a crazy quit."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,911.61,914.745,--I disagree with what the Ninth Circuit did in that respect.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.251,924.835,It said no.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,924.835,926.287,--resolved it against--
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.287,926.82,Yeah.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,926.82,927.52,--Petitioner.
1989.89-189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.742,953.937,"And I thought it... I meant to say that if the Arizona court thought that on these facts that circumstance existed, the whole system... or, that whole aggravating circumstance wasn't adequate to avoid an arbitrary system."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,953.937,955.27,I don't... I don't think they went that far.
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.899,973.6,"May I ask you another question, Mr. Grant?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,983.323,984.023,Yes.
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.023,992.312,"Now, if... I'm not saying we should... but if we should agree with... have that same view, what do we do with this case?"
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,998.383,1006.072,"Well, my first answer would be that question is not before the Court in this case, although Respondent disagrees with me."
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.072,1016.594,"But it's... it would be sort of... if this is the sole aggravating circumstance and if we're convinced, based on the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in the other case that it's an invalid circumstance, I find it rather difficult to say we should execute this man."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1016.594,1018.546,"Well, my second response--"
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.546,1018.962,You see?
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1018.962,1022.331,"--then would be, first of all, that issue is before this Court in Walton, which--"
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.331,1022.831,Right.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1028.867,1033.722,--Assuming... assuming the Court ruled against the state's position in Walton--
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.722,1034.138,Yeah.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1034.138,1042.162,"--the question would then become under Teague and Penry whether or not that rule, whatever rule it is that the Court adopts,--"
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.162,1048.732,"Well, assume they not only ruled against you but they thought it was covered by Godfrey or something like that so it wasn't a new rule."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1048.732,1054.052,"--If it is not a new rule under the Penry and Teague analysis, it could be applied to this case."
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.921,1056.187,I see.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1056.187,1059.389,--it's not dictated by Maynard and it's not dictated by Godfrey.
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.325,1063.675,"And, of course, you say it's wrong too."
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1066.293,1066.643,Correct.
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.643,1066.977,Yeah.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1066.977,1069.229,"But assuming, as your hypothetical was--"
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.229,1069.629,Yeah.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1069.629,1073.883,"--that... that this Court were to rule against us on that point, that would be my response."
1989.89-189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.418,1078.818,Yeah.
1989.89-189,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1078.818,1088.024,--of the circumstance.
1989.89-189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.867,1255.351,"Very well, Mr. Grant."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1269.71,1274.364,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1342.258,1347.226,This... this is the point on which the Ninth Circuit ruled against your client?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1347.226,1347.693,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.999,1360.47,"Well, it did... it did make one favorable ruling to the state."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1361.803,1371.009,"That ruling was that the statute... and it says statute repeatedly... the statute on its face was not unconstitutional, and it cites Gregg."
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.028,1464.37,"If... if the Supreme Court of Arizona had in effect said exactly what the Ninth Circuit said, I take it we'd have jurisdiction on direct review to reverse them under your theory?"
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1464.37,1465.987,--If the Supreme Court of Arizona said--
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1465.987,1479.297,"Let's say... let's say the Ninth Circuit opinion was really written by the Supreme Court of Arizona in this case, I take it under your theory we'd have jurisdiction on direct review if... assuming we granted cert.... to reverse them."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1479.297,1481.082,"--Absolutely, because it would have been decided on the--"
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.082,1485.117,"You have to say to say that for your theory of the case, I take it."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1485.117,1494.14,"--Yes, but I think that there's no question but that what the Ninth Circuit intended to do here was to extract a standard."
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1525.661,1526.478,"Well, I'll look at the case again."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1541.638,1548.291,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's not a fair reading of the decision of the Ninth Circuit and I would like to take the Court through that--"
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.291,1548.607,Fine.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1548.607,1551.576,--because it seems to be an important point.
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1603.611,1604.678,Where are you reading?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1604.678,1605.146,I'm sorry.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.848,1610.884,A-24.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1610.884,1614.502,A-24.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.791,1635.749,"Well, yes, but on A-25 it says that... it says that in Chaney the court held that..."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1642.653,1646.973,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, you changed a word there, and I think it's an important word."
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.675,1651.209,We stated in Chaney that--
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1651.209,1652.377,--That it appears.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.377,1652.844,--Uh-huh.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1652.844,1665.518,"Then it goes on to give in the next sentence... I think it's important, Your Honor, because in the next sentence they do say the holding of Chaney... the holding of Chaney is that the application in that case was constitutional."
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.39,1684.765,"Well, I want you to get there, but jut before you do... in other words, you're going to interpret that as saying we imposed a sentence on Chaney under a statute that was not constitutional?"
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1684.765,1685.348,No.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.319,1722.771,"You're... you're attributing an extraordinarily Jesuitical approach to Judge Canby, I think."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1722.771,1726.675,"--Well, no, Your Honor, and there's a very good reason why I don't think I am doing that."
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.125,1781.577,Was that the same panel?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1781.577,1783.512,--It was an en banc court.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.249,1789.782,Right.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1789.782,1796.669,"--the Adamson decision also signed the Ninth Circuit decision in this case, in the panel case, Judge Pregerson."
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.881,1820.185,"Well, that may be a later interpretation of what they thought they said in Chaney, but we're... we're reviewing this case."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1820.185,1821.221,"--But, Your Honor, we're reviewing--"
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.221,1822.237,We're reviewing this case.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1822.237,1822.587,--Excuse me.
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.124,1833.878,"Well, I still don't see how you're helped because I think you're going to go to A... the first paragraph on A-26."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1833.878,1834.861,--Uh-huh.
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.861,1837.663,Isn't that where you were going to take us on this same point?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1837.663,1838.515,"Yes, it was."
1989.89-189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1856.227,1857.61,Applied to Jeffers in this case.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1857.61,1858.56,--To Jeffers in this case.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.066,1867.233,But that... that isn't the language.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1871.486,1872.236,"--Well, let me--"
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.236,1879.842,Is capable of... it does not answer the question whether the Arizona statute was constitutionally applied to Jeffers in this case.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1879.842,1880.225,--Right.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.652,1954.473,"I'm not sure we're not spending a disproportionate amount of time, considering each side has half an hour, on an interpretation of what the lower court meant."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,1958.109,1959.294,"You may be right, Your Honor."
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.333,2029.272,If you... are you talking about a case-by-case analysis of each case to see whether the aggravating circumstance was... quote... constitutional or not?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2029.272,2029.689,No.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.824,2422.978,So that's basically the way the Supreme Court of Arizona has defined for state law purposes that term in its capital statute?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2422.978,2423.861,Right.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.218,2576.144,"Well, what if... what if the... the... what if the court says here is a series of things that will show that something is depraved... that the killing was depraved."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2599.093,2599.809,"--Well, you're suggesting--"
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.809,2612.401,"And in application here is... so, shouldn't the question be whether the factors that they used in concluding that this was a depraved murder are valid?"
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2612.401,2613.686,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.805,2619.421,"Well, I asked you the question--"
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2619.421,2620.007,--Okay.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.218,2637.751,--Yes?
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2637.751,2639.051,The answer is yes.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.122,2657.882,"Well, you might... you might say that if you look at all of the cases that this definition they're applying is just sort of... all it amounts to is saying especially depraved."
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2657.882,2658.465,That's right.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.465,2660.082,That's what kind of an argument you make.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2669.69,2672.49,"Well, Your Honor, I... if I take your hypothetical--"
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.49,2672.991,Yeah.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2673.491,2678.409,--I'm saying that you... you could save... you could save it in... in that way in an individual case.
1989.89-189,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.845,2679.261,Yes.
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2679.711,2690.353,--that's the process that Oklahoma is now going through in looking at case after case in the wake of Maynard and saving some cases and not savings others because it's finding that there were factors in those cases.
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.909,2811.113,"Well, then you find another adjective than heinous to modify by that adverb or--"
1989.89-189,1,31626,james_s_liebman,,2811.113,2830.927,"--If you had another phrase... instead of heinous if you had some core definition that has, as Justice White I think put it in Jurek, that has a common sense core of meaning... for example, torture, or, for example, an intent to inflict great harm."
1989.89-189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.86,3035.043,"--Thank you, Mr. Liebman."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3037.728,3043.465,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-189,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3272.53,3274.649,"Yes, but he... he won below."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3274.649,3275.966,He won below on the second issue.
1989.89-189,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3275.966,3280.97,And why can't he... why can't he defend the judgment on the other ground?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3280.97,3282.103,I would have two responses to that.
1989.89-189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.524,3313.274,"Well, I know."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3317.559,3331.835,"My second response would be... and the name of the case doesn't jump to my mind at the moment, but it's cited in the answering brief... essentially Respondent's position is that he can defend the judgment below on any grounds available to him."
1989.89-189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.345,3353.248,"Yeah, but at least he can defend it on a... on a ground that was raised below and it was decided against him."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3353.248,3364.306,"Well, my second response then would be he can... and, according to that case which he cited in his brief, he can decide it... he can defend it on that ground so long as it does not expand the relief."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.184,3389.005,But that wouldn't expand the relief for this particular individual.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3389.005,3389.821,Correct.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.821,3391.671,"I mean, he's either got... may I ask, your--"
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3391.671,3395.491,It would expand it for other cases because the Ninth Circuit would apply it there.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.491,3395.874,--Yes.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3406.716,3409.049,Well--
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.049,3410.584,Is there any one fact that must--
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3410.584,3412.284,"--First, as to why I didn't state the standard."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3417.838,3419.274,"--Well, I'm not... I'm not criticizing you for it."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3421.559,3422.676,"--Well, I think the standard is--"
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.676,3424.326,Can you tell us one... one requirement that must be met?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3424.326,3428.396,"--I think the standard is stated in the Gretzler case, which I referred to in my reply brief."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3428.396,3429.645,I don't have the Gretzler case in front of me.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3429.645,3430.162,The first two--
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.162,3430.931,Can you state the standard?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3430.931,3441.187,"--The first two examples, as Mr. Liebman stated, the Supreme Court of Arizona essentially first looked to the dictionary definitions of the terms."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.434,3462.051,"Now, is either one of those... is either one of those sufficient?"
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3462.051,3462.969,--I think yes.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3463.336,3479.512,"Does that mean... we had a case that I was thinking about during the argument in which the murderer was upset about what the victim had done to his sister and he participated in a brutal killing and there was... when the killing took place, he in effect said, you got what you deserved."
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3486.182,3491.669,"--I don't think it is always, but I think what you have here went beyond a simple statement of you got what you deserved."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.669,3497.14,What... what revenge killings would and what would not comply with the relish factor?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3497.14,3517.887,"I would think a situation where the defendant after injecting his victim with heroin, an overdose of heroin, and finding that that wasn't sufficient to kill her, after he makes statements to another person in the room that he's given her enough heroin to kill a horse and that the bitch won't die, where he then climbs on top of the victim, who is unconscious lying on a bed--"
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3517.887,3522.272,And is that climbing on top to finish the job off... is that the gratuitous violence where he--
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3522.272,3522.755,--That's getting to it.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3522.755,3523.239,--thought it was--
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3523.239,3523.572,That's getting to it.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.572,3523.941,--What?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3523.941,3525.074,We're not there yet.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3525.074,3526.157,What is the gratuitous violence?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3526.157,3530.611,"The gratuitous violence... he then, after climbing on top of her, choked her with a belt."
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.13,3536.182,When does it become gratuitous is what I'm trying to figure.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3536.182,3536.782,--At that stage.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.782,3537.932,Is it when it's no longer necessary to kill?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3537.932,3545.287,At that stage he eventually he... I believe at that point the evidence shows that Ms. Chaney was dead.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3559.297,3561.064,When she did that was the victim already dead?
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3561.064,3561.78,--Yes.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3569.986,3573.205,I thought the lower court said that what happened after she died didn't count.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3573.205,3581.127,The lower court only stated that with respect to Ms. Jeffers' conduct in disposing of the body three days later.
1989.89-189,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.137,3595.503,Yeah.
1989.89-189,2,25384,gerald_r_grant,,3595.503,3598.755,--of people who he felt that Ms. Chaney had informed on.
1989.89-189,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3675.822,3676.488,"Thank you, Mr. Grant."
