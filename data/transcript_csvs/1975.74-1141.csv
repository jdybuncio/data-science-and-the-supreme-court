1975.74-1141,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.496,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Gaddis and Birt.
1975.74-1141,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,12.723,16.277,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1706.034,1708.109,"I will address myself to that question, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.109,1711.153,Do it in your own time.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1711.153,1714.606,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.189,1751.924,A case?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1751.924,1753.652,"A case, Sir."
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.787,1798.824,Why did you not object to the failure to give the instruction that you now say should have been given?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1798.824,1802.286,The two-two responses to that question.
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.47,1843.921,"Isn’t that the whole point of objections in the Trial Court is so that the District Judge who maybe on the point of erring can have his attention called, and if you fail to object, you are presumably barred from raising that point?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1843.921,1846.437,"Your Honor, unless it is plain error."
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.522,1849.592,Why was this plain error?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1849.592,1864.936,"The reason this was plain error is it, for one thing whether or not an objection is made as plain error or not more times, and that goes to the facts in the case, so the courts that have considered have said that anyway, whether that evidence is overwhelming or not."
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.284,1883.227,Well why did they decide it was plain error?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1883.227,1905.041,"The case of United States v. Roach and O’Neal v. United States, and those cases went off on the fact that, and also that, and Baker versus United States."
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.488,1919.819,Well that is true of almost any Jury exceptions.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,1943.415,1945.943,"Certainly, we bear some of the responsibility."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2001.558,2012.683,"In evaluating of plain error claim, is it of some consequence that the error wasn’t so plain that the counsel in the case didn’t see it?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2012.683,2013.688,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.001,2046.102,"Then do you think in those circumstances the prosecutor should be required to elect before the case is tried which count, he is going to stand on?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2046.102,2050.253,"Either before the case is tried or before the case is submitted to the Jury, yes Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.253,2056.004,Did you move for dismissal of all of the charges at the close of the evidence?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2056.004,2064.723,"Yes we did, we have made the motion for judgment of acquittal -- conclusion of the prosecution’s case and also at the conclusion of the case as a whole."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.014,2093.944,Where was the money found?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2093.944,2101.71,"Interestingly enough the money was found in the possession of the wife of Mr. Davis, the co-defendant."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.989,2289.984,Did the driver of this car take a shot at the policeman?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2289.984,2301.053,"The evidence adduced at the trial, given Davis’ testimony, was as I recall the driver of the getaway car did fire at the policeman when he arrived at the scene."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2301.053,2305.228,Do you think that makes any difference as to whether he was participant in the robbery?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2305.228,2306.142,"I do not, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2311.271,2317.223,The man who guides the robbers inside the bank is not a party to the robbery?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2317.223,2325.41,"Under an aiding and abetting charge where there had certainly a Jury could return that type of verdict, I have no quarrel with that."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.507,2335.592,"That was the defense verdict, isn't it?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2335.592,2336.721,"Not really, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.718,2348.762,I am talking about the driver of the car.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2348.762,2349.76,That is correct.
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.76,2353.486,You mean the only people guilty in the robbery are those inside the bank?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2353.486,2354.462,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.462,2355.403,Well what do you say?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2355.403,2357.191,I am not taking that position.
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.399,2372.915,But she didn’t shoot anybody?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2372.915,2374.849,"She did not shoot anybody, that is true."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.291,2381.425,But were the men in this case charged with assault?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2381.425,2383.414,They were.
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.414,2385.021,"Well he was guilty of that then, wasn’t he?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2385.021,2387.575,"That is correct, given the facts."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.575,2389.075,Well I have lost your point.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2389.075,2396.659,"Well the point is simply this, that in our position whether or not it is a single transaction or two transactions is of no import."
1975.74-1141,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2447.57,2457.802,"Under the statue, it simply is not possible to break this into separate offenses of this kind, it is one offense."
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2464.076,2465.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.809,2496.442,No matter what maybe the length and time between the date of the robbery and the incident which led to the possession charged?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2496.442,2497.666,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2497.666,2500.234,It is about the same person?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2500.234,2500.769,In this particular—
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2500.769,2504.107,"The robber cannot be can't be convicted of possession, somebody else could be convicted of possession."
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2504.107,2505.537,That is correct.
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2509.736,2516.21,But this is a situation where Gaddis was convicted of robbery?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2516.21,2516.951,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.951,2522.674,"That being so, no matter what the interval may have been which led to the possession count."
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2522.674,2524.273,"He cannot be convicted, that is correct."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.273,2525.115,As a matter of law?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2525.115,2525.559,As a matter of law.
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.559,2527.202,Under this statute?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2527.202,2528.371,Under this statute.
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.371,2529.747,That is what Heflin said.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2540.692,2541.556,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2613.175,2617.276,"Well there is no question what the Jury decided as respect to the individual counts, isn’t it?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2617.276,2618.031,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2619.458,2622.97,"They made separate, in turn separate verdicts on the different counts, each count?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2622.97,2623.824,They did.
1975.74-1141,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.815,2640.084,"Well you point is in any event, the Jury under this statute could have convicted on these facts, of robbery or nothing?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2640.084,2642.549,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2692.313,2697.787,"Why do you think, or do you think that is not the proper solution?"
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2697.787,2715.349,"It is not, Your Honor, because I have the feel that what has been done there is that an appellate court then has looked at the facts there really, I am almost arguing for fairness on behalf of the government, and that the appellate court has decided that this man was guilty of possession but was not guilty of robbery."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2750.885,2756.237,Why do you say concurrent sentence doctrine was not --
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2756.237,2758.182,For number of reasons.
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.352,2780.86,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2780.86,2781.974,"Yes it is, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.086,2791.142,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2791.142,2793.977,"Not to bring it under concurrent sentence doctrine, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.649,2848.623,(Inaudible) with the instructions that the court acquit on the possession charged.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2848.623,2862.721,"The objection would be, Mr. Justice, that the same fear that this court had in Milanovich would be of course evidence and that is that an appellate court had decided which offense these particular men were guilty of."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2868.243,2873.093,What more do you want in there?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2873.093,2876.141,We want a new trial in this particular case.
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.141,2877.083,Yes.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2877.083,2878.484,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.484,2879.422,You want a new trial.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2886.559,2891.857,"Well certainly, we made a motion for judgment of acquittal after the evidence was adduced to trial and then again—"
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2891.857,2895.516,Did you cite the failure to give the either-or instruction in there?
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2895.516,2897.274,"No, we did not, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.274,2900.384,"So, so far that was concerned you were satisfied."
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2900.384,2905.92,That is correct at that time.
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2956.995,2964.427,Well one can reject that is take it without necessarily feeling that the thing ought to be sent back for a new trial at all.
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,2980.405,2981.352,"Yes I do, Your Honor."
1975.74-1141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.439,3009.288,"Well but all that Jury did was found facts, that seems to me that Heflin and Milanovich do not say anything more that, and as a matter of law, not as a matter of fact."
1975.74-1141,1,43430,tommy_day_wilcox,,3020.952,3023.314,"Certainly, that is a hard proposition to argue with."
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3339.779,3342.214,Just one or two points.
1975.74-1141,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3354.738,3358.367,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3358.367,3359.669,"Right, well Heflin—"
1975.74-1141,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3359.669,3364.792,That Heflin (Inaudible)
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3364.792,3367.007,"Yes, it certainly was a statutory construction."
1975.74-1141,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3374.947,3380.362,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3380.362,3384.384,He made both points that it was a separate class of offenders.
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3408.148,3419.916,"If the government’s interest be adequately protective, if the Jury was instructed to return a verdict on only one of these counts?"
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3433.303,3437.875,Well that would certainly be better than returning an acquittal on the possession count.
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.994,3465.024,"Well then, but, and then -- if you had both counts in the indictment you would just tell the Jury that you do not that, if you find, unless you find the person guilty of robbery you may convict him for possession if the evidence warrants it?"
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3465.024,3471.167,"But, but the robbery conviction maybe ultimately overturned for reasons that would not infect a possession conviction."
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3482.751,3491.525,"It seems to me then you are, you are disagreeing with the construction of the statute that the court has adopted in."
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3497.362,3505.719,"No, all that I am saying is that-that one, that at law there is no crime of possession for one who robs—"
1975.74-1141,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.719,3507.158,"Well, that is what I am talking about the law."
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3510.119,3519.29,"No, I do not think that is correct in this case because whether or not somebody is one who robs has only determined at the conclusion of the litigation."
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.605,3525.514,"Well, you tell me Mr. Frey, who should be held guilty?"
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3532.384,3532.566,Yes.
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3532.566,3539.973,"And you instructed the Jury that if you find the person guilty of robbery, do not find him guilty of possession?"
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3556.235,3557.784,I am not sure that I understand that—
1975.74-1141,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3557.784,3561.389,Well you are saying that there are three crimes involved now in this statute.
1975.74-1141,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3573.354,3583.174,"No, we do not challenge the ultimate conclusion that ultimately one who is convicted of robbery ought not to have a conviction on his record for possession."
1975.74-1141,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.656,3641.262,Thank you gentleman.
