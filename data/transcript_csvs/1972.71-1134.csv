1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.019,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-1134, Roaden against Kentucky."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,53.745,57.782,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,195.686,217.941,"Now if on Monday night the sheriff went with the local magistrate, a person authorized to issue warrants and the magistrate observed the film and then on Tuesday morning issued a warrant, would that satisfy your claims?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,217.941,219.647,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.647,229.513,You would want a -- you would want an adversary proceeding in which you could appear to try to persuade the magistrate that there was probable cause to believe?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,229.513,232.462,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,233.361,240.52,You are going to tie out the issue of obscenity in the warrant issuing proceeding?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,240.52,253.559,"We, we would ask a meaningful opportunity on the part of the petitioner to be heard to counter the judgment of the local law enforcement officer, that the film was obscene."
1972.71-1134,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,253.559,260.289,"But would the issue then not be probable cause, but obscenity down on of the film?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,260.289,268.43,I think the issue would be probable obscenity of the film.
1972.71-1134,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,268.43,270.483,Probable cause.
1972.71-1134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.483,284.641,"I don't see, to follow up the question of Chief Justice, I don't see why in your case, may be you are concerned about in hearing the success of the next case, but taking your case alone, I don't see why you need to contend that the constitution requires an adversary hearing."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,305.18,323.521,"Your Honor, we believe the issue of obscenity is so sensitive and this Court had said that it's separated by only a down and uncertain line and that separation calls for the use of sensitive tools."
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,326.442,330.901,You think it's more sensitive than searching a private home?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,330.901,331.648,Yes.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.648,338.037,Under Kentucky Law do you have an adversary proceeding to get a search warrant to search a private home?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,338.037,340.215,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1134,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.215,368.542,"Well Mr. Wicker, I thought, perhaps alone, in Marcus and Quantity of Books both of which involved magazines as I remember, I thought we held the proceedings, you know, it's a warrant proceeding, had to be one in which there was the determination not a probable cause, but of the obscenity vel non of material before they could be seized, am I wrong about that?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,368.542,383.38,"Mr. Chief -- Mr. Justice Brennan, my reading of the Marcus and Books case convinces me that adversary hearing pertains to probable obscenity."
1972.71-1134,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,385.651,390.387,That doesn't prove too much?[Laughter]
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,390.387,399.521,"Well then what is there to try, what would be there to try if the determination was a determination vel non of the obscenity."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,408.013,416.867,There would be no need for any further proceeding if it were determined that there was not probable cause to believe the film to be obscene.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,416.867,436.947,"I am taking the other time, if the magistrate issues the warrant on a showing which must reach the level of determination of obscenity rather than probable cause or probable obscenity."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,436.947,442.023,"There would be no need for further trial in that case, Your Honor."
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.023,453.27,"Then you might be in the trial right the next morning after showing of the film, would you not,would be res judicata of the issue?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,453.27,467.088,"No, Your Honor at the time."
1972.71-1134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.682,577.408,"Mr. Wicker as I read the opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the commissioner who wrote the opinion said that, during the trial of the action, you conceded the obscenity of the film, is that a correct statement?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,577.408,617.254,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we maintain that, that it is not a correct statement of the closing argument and we think that a fair reading of the closing argument will disclose to this Court that was trial strategy and even, even if the Court concluded that there was a concession made in the closing argument, we nevertheless maintain that all material regardless of its eventual characterization as obscene or non-obscene is clothed with the same procedural safeguards until there has been an adversary hearing."
1972.71-1134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.254,632.638,"But wouldn't an adversary hearing had been pretty much of a charade in this case, if when you first got your chance to have an adversary hearing and the trial you conceded the obscenity of the film?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,632.638,653.222,"We did not concede the obscenity and -- but for the protection of material that is not obscene whether this material will turn out to be obscene or not or whether it was conceded that any time during the trial, we don't think it is important."
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.126,867.773,"Well if a policeman on the beach witnesses conduct which he regards as obscene and offends particular ordinances or statutes, doesn't he have to make a judgment then and there whether there is probable cause to make an arrest and take the person in the custody?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,867.773,873.422,That's true in most cases Mr. Chief justice but not in the area of First Amendment rights.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,873.422,897.239,"Well suppose -- suppose the man says that he is picketing for something or other but he is engaging in a lurid and obscene exhibition in that process carrying a picket sign at the same time, doesn't the policeman have to make judgments constantly?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,897.239,907.144,I don't believe that a police officer in the field is capable of applying Roth test with respect to obscenity.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.144,915.8,"Well he doesn't -- a policeman in these circumstances isn't making any final determination, is he?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,915.8,925.837,But once he makes his determination and seizes the film then there is the danger that non-obscene material has been restrained.
1972.71-1134,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,925.837,935.075,"Mr. Wicker, would it make any difference in your position if your client had had a duplicate film and could have continued to show it to the public?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,935.075,949.215,"Mr. Justice Powell, I believe that any requirement that a theater owner – he – two films on him is too burdensome and are made --"
1972.71-1134,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,949.215,950.575,That wasn't my question.
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,960.745,976.991,"I still feel that the petitioner's Fourth Amendment rights were involved and that even the seizure of one film imposes a restraint, whether it's one film or dozen films."
1972.71-1134,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,980.836,991.46,"If your client operated a bookstore with 100 books and only one was seized for the purpose of evidence at a trial, I take it your answer would be the same?"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,991.46,1007.117,"My answer would be the same Mr. Justice Powell because we believe the First Amendment makes no reference to quantity that it affords one book, one film, the same protection."
1972.71-1134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.117,1020.861,"Mr. Wicker, returning for a moment to the question I asked you earlier, I call your attention to page 37 of the appendix and what was apparently your argument at the jury, at the bottom of the page 37."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,1043.704,1044.577,"Yes sir, it was."
1972.71-1134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.577,1051.735,-- I would certainly be inclined to think that supported his suggestion that you had conceded it?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,1051.735,1059.812,We maintain Mr. Justice Rehnquist that we did not concede the obscenity of the film that this was trial strategy.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1080.187,1104.648,"Well how is your situation different in this case with that argument than if you had been trying a man, defending a man on a first degree murder charge and you argued to the jury that yes undoubtedly he did kill the victim, but it was an accident and therefore it should be a manslaughter verdict and not a first degree murder verdict."
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,1108.679,1114.116,"Your Honor, I don't believe there is much difference in that the Jury had to make two findings."
1972.71-1134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.826,1136.235,Doesn't it make any difference whether it is obscene or not?
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,1136.235,1139.089,"No it doesn't, Mr. Justice Marshall because --"
1972.71-1134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1139.089,1143.771,"Just for my information, was it obscene or not?[Laughter]"
1972.71-1134,0,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,1143.771,1157.807,Mr. Justice Marshall I did not believe that that film was obscene when compared with other films which have been held not be obscene.
1972.71-1134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.016,1167.12,Very well Mr. Wicker.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1178.591,1183.115,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.9,1326.456,"While you are talking about film, when is this film returned to him or still you have them?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1326.456,1327.869,When is it or has it been?
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.869,1328.475,"Huh, huh."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1328.475,1330.473,"It is in the custody of the Court of Appeals, sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1330.473,1331.987,Until this day.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1331.987,1336.194,"Until this day, yes sir of Kentucky."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.194,1339.287,"They do not have an any person (Inaudible) property with that, do you?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1339.287,1359.677,"No sir, because even to this day and this was my next point, petitioner has not moved for the return of the film, his moved for the film which was admittedly obscene to be suppressed in evidence but he has not moved for a return of this film so he might later show it."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.394,1363.971,You could do.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1365.224,1367.382,"Sir, that is correct, for use it is evidence."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.382,1370.699,Have you offered it back -- to give it back to him?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1370.699,1375.207,I would say that the burden would be upon petitioner to move for its return.
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.207,1378.124,"Now you answer my question, have you offered to give it back?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1378.124,1381.002,No sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1510.914,1511.677,Well now Mr. Bullock?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1511.677,1512.509,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1512.509,1526.428,"In the Marcus case, the police officer there involved went to the various newsstands and picked up a copy of each of the magazines about it."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1526.428,1527.446,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1527.446,1545.33,"And then he went before a magistrate on sworn complaints in which he stated that each of those places, each of the news dealers, and I am quoting, kept for the purpose of sale of obscene publications.”"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1551.683,1552.532,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1552.532,1560.509,"And we held with that procedure did not comport with constitutional due process and liability limit implications involved, did we not?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1560.509,1561.048,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1561.048,1567.522,Well how does that procedure differ and how is the procedure here differ any from that was done there.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1569.818,1570.421,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.421,1581.316,"Well, this was a seizure and similarly nobody was arrested at that time because that was a, as you have pointed out is (Inaudible)"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1581.316,1581.681,Right.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.681,1585.459,Well other than that how is only difference between two procedures?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1594.062,1596.958,"Well, I think there might be two answers to that sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1621.114,1643.638,"Well our point is not whether statement have a procedure to seize a film and prevent its being altered. Our question is, isn't it, whether or not the statement have a procedure before seizure of the film itself, without first determining its obscenity as the question."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1643.638,1644.861,Yes.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1647.539,1653.085,"Well, what we concerned with here is whether you can issue a warrant as was done in this case, wasn't it, on probable cause."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1653.085,1653.934,"There was no warrant, no sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1653.934,1655.144,"Now what, just an arrest?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1655.144,1659.818,There was an arrest in the officer's presence.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1659.818,1661.863,And the question is whether you can do that.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1661.863,1662.186,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.186,1666.63,Without having a determination of the obscenity vel non of a motion picture?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1666.63,1674.007,And we maintained that you do not have to have the prior adversary hearing or determination vel non ahead of time.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1680.104,1684.407,And this is on the grounds of difference between films and magazine?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1684.407,1687.453,"That is a part of, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1687.453,1691.135,I gather that there are good many cases that have held the other way?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1691.135,1691.9,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.9,1692.999,Most of them I gather?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1692.999,1711.286,"Well, it is -- there has been a number of cases in the lower court, specially the District Courts that have held, you could have seizure and then they been sometimes overturned, a number of state courts the same way, they have been overturned but there is still some cases left."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.286,1720.559,"Is Marcus and A Quantity of Books didn't hold it that you could not seize one copy for the use as evidence, did they?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1720.559,1722.02,"Not to my recollection, no sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.02,1730.048,This held but you couldn't take a circulation that entire series of publication?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1730.048,1731.158,"That's correct, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.158,1744.676,"And of course, taking one copy of circulation of a movie might take the entire thing or the entire showing out of circulation?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1744.676,1757.038,"Well as we maintain Mr. Justice White in our brief, we feel that it's not unreasonable to require under certain circumstances a second copy to be kept."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.23,1776.119,"If you are going to have a hearing about obscenity, you could have give them subpoena to bring it to that particular hearing and otherwise leave it in circulation."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1788.712,1791.946,"I believe there is substance in the alteration theory, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.297,1817.825,"You, you wouldn't -- if there were two films, if the operator had two films, you wouldn't argue that the state can seize both copies in the case of Marcus and Quantity, would you?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1817.825,1820.493,"No, sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.717,1823.567,That's the question.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1823.567,1824.311,That's the question.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1824.311,1826.698,And if that's the only print --
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1826.698,1827.11,Sir?
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1827.11,1832.387,If that is the only print that's supplied to the exhibitor.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1832.387,1848.6,"If that were the only print, then in that case I would suggest a motion whereby maybe some security could be given that the film would be returned in its original shape for use in the trial, could be -- some limitations could be put on it."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.6,1852.512,"Do we know here whether there are more than one print, I guess, Mr. Justice Powell asked you that."
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1852.512,1858.254,"I can state that outside the record to my knowledge, if it please the Court, it's showing here in town."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1858.254,1858.964,In Washington?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1858.964,1862.207,"In Washington, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1862.207,1866.225,Name the theater.[Laughter]
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1866.225,1868.467,"It's my understanding that's showing, let me put it that way."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.467,1870.819,"Well, is that (Inaudible) or anything?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1870.819,1877.56,"I haven't seen it sir in Washington, I couldn't tell you."
1972.71-1134,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.118,1909.75,"But would it be wrong with having the magistrate and the sheriff and the prosecutor go and see the movie on Monday, issue the warrant on Tuesday and go out and seize it then, if a non-adversary proceeding would satisfy Kentucky law and the constitution, a number of ifs in there?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1909.75,1932.933,"Yes, the Kentucky law though says that it is proper to seize the evidence, incidental to a lawful arrest and there was a proper arrest and it's my understanding the question before the Court is whether there is a need for a prior adversary hearing and it's of course, our contention that it is not necessary."
1972.71-1134,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1932.933,1948.656,"Even if there isn't a need for a prior adversary hearing, you would lose if the constitution requires a determination by a neutral and detached magistrate, would you not, if there is just simply a requirement of a warrant?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1948.656,1953.213,Accept that in this case there was not just a sheriff.
1972.71-1134,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.39,1961.947,"Yes, but he is not a neutral and detached magistrate, is he?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1961.947,1976.862,"He is going to be the one that charged with bringing the prosecution obviously since the monkey would be his back so to speak, he would have reason to make certain that there is probable cause before making --"
1972.71-1134,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.862,1977.834,"Well, he is a prosecutor?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1977.834,1979.34,"Yes, he is prosecutor."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.34,1984.39,Why not use (Inaudible) search warrant while you're at it?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1984.39,1986.099,"Couldn't possibly do that, Your Honor?"
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.099,1988.645,Are you kidding?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,1988.645,1994.235,"No, I thought you asked for a search warrant is concerned, I misunderstood you?"
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.235,2004.997,"Well, what -- is there anything in the record that show any expertise on the part of either these two men in the field of what is and what is not obscenity?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2004.997,2012.139,The record Mr. Justice Marshall shows that the sheriff was -- had been a sheriff for some ten years.
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.023,2051.274,It is the final determination as to whether or not the film is going to be seized without a search warrant?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2051.274,2052.935,That's correct.
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2052.935,2054.451,So that's final.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2054.451,2054.929,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2056.627,2066.721,He has absolutely no expertise over and above any other citizen in this County in the field of obscenity?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2066.721,2070.532,"Yes of course, if it is not obscene, it would be returned."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.532,2082.043,"My question is, does he has any expertise in the field of obscenity over and beyond every other citizen in the county?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2082.043,2085.592,There is no showing in the record that he has any expertise other than being --
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.592,2089.781,But then how did he know that a crime was being committed?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2089.781,2097.38,Because he could observe that the situation that is occurring and come to the conclusion that it did appeal to prurient interest.
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2097.38,2102.872,"Then under the law of Kentucky, I imagine anybody in the field, that could could make a citizen's arrest?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2102.872,2104.12,"Not for misdemeanor, no sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.12,2104.974,You don't think so?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2104.974,2105.948,No sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.948,2111.804,(Inaudible) always had any particular expertise when they returned a verdict of guilty?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2111.804,2113.359,"I was going to mention that, sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.647,2139.273,"This wouldn't -- would it not follow is a matter of course that if lay jurors can do it, a peace officer can do it on the lesser standard of probable cause whereas the lay juror has got to find it beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2139.273,2141.214,"Yes sir, that would be my point."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2141.214,2142.667,Was this a drive-in?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2142.667,2155.979,"Yes sir, it was a drive-in which without getting to the rape or robbery case, at least the deputy sheriff was to the side of the movie theater and was observing that from a post outside of the --"
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2155.979,2157.487,Meaning a bridge or something?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2157.487,2162.45,"No, it was a little street, a road to the side of the drive-in theater."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.45,2163.792,And he could see it from the street.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2163.792,2174.826,"He could see the nude scenes that were going on from that area, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2254.055,2254.848,May I ask you a question?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2254.848,2254.9,Yes sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2254.9,2257.939,Is the officer on that side of street just by happenstance or he goes there for purpose?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2257.939,2259.815,"No, sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.05,2265.826,On this very place?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2265.826,2266.542,"On this place, yes sir."
1972.71-1134,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.127,2570.392,Is there any evidence in this record as to what it cost to rent this film and how long it would have taken him to get a substitute film?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2570.392,2573.104,"No, sir, there is no showing in the record."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2609.159,2610.302,Who issues warrant?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2610.302,2610.784,Sir.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2610.784,2611.727,Who issues warrant?
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2611.727,2613.271,"Magistrates, I believe can issue."
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2613.271,2614.969,And you have.
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2614.969,2616.148,We have County Judge too.
1972.71-1134,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2616.148,2624.12,"Yes, but I mean you have available magistrates, so if warrant had been required here I gather that had been an available magistrate (Inaudible)"
1972.71-1134,1,38743,robert_v_bullock,,2624.12,2627.881,"In a warrant situation, I would suppose that is true."
1972.71-1134,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2702.205,2705.79,"Thank you Mr. Bullock, Mr. Wicker, do you have anything further?"
1972.71-1134,2,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,2705.79,2712.131,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1134,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2811.984,2821.216,"That's the state's position here that one exhibition reaches many, many people, are you supporting the state's position on that score?"
1972.71-1134,2,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,2821.216,2836.354,"The restrained imposed upon us exhibition deprives many people of an opportunity to see the film, to receive the expression and the ideas contained therein."
1972.71-1134,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.354,2850.363,"But if it's obscenity do you concede that it -- they are not entitled to exhibit it and people are not entitled to receive it, if it is obscenity?"
1972.71-1134,2,38458,phillip_k_wicker,,2850.363,2863.739,"Again, Your Honor, the determination is so sensitive under the Roth test that there is no other way, to determine obscenity."
1972.71-1134,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.104,3180.73,Thank you gentlemen.
