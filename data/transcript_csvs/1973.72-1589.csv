1973.72-1589,0,21041,duncan_m_james,,58.966,62.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1589,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,84.647,87.461,"Now, let's turn that page again, would you?"
1973.72-1589,0,21041,duncan_m_james,,87.461,88.762,The page 4.
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,974.146,977.923,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1589,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.145,1192.291,Isn’t that the confusion that the State of California can resolve for itself?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1192.291,1194.061,That is exactly our position Your Honor.
1973.72-1589,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.986,1202.377,Without the Supreme Court?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1202.377,1212.038,"Well, the State Supreme Court has said that the words infamous crime and high crime are practically undefinable for all purposes as I see it in Otsuka."
1973.72-1589,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1220.548,1229.869,"Well, under your State Constitution if the legislature were to define infamous crime, would that create a problem for your California courts?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1231.939,1232.82,It might Your Honor.
1973.72-1589,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.004,1274.525,Was there any doubt about the power and the authority of the Supreme Court of California to define in its own way what infamous crime means?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1274.525,1277.941,"No, but they haven’t done it Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1277.941,1280.099,"But there’s any doubt about their power, that is all?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1280.099,1282.428,"Oh no, I believe they have the power to do it Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.93,1284.913,Mr. Roth?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1284.913,1285.313,Yes sir.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.313,1313.536,"Mr. Roth, I’m looking at exhibit 1 of the -- where is it -- in the -- to the petition for writ of mandate which appears on page 28 of the appendix which is a report of the Secretary of State of California regarding the right to vote of ex-felons in California dated May 30, 1972, which indicates as you know been denied that there was been extraordinarily uneven application?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1313.536,1313.934,No question.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.934,1326.711,"In fact in the various county of a state, for example, the crime of murder disqualifies a person from voting in at least four counties but does not disqualified in at least six counties."
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1334.707,1335.28,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.28,1337.373,That is part of the record in this case.
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1362.609,1362.94,No.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.136,1372.342,"In California in fact it does not that it allows -- this petitioner was or rather this respondent was convicted of what, burglary, was it?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1372.342,1373.212,"Well, there’s three."
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1377.474,1387.14,"Right, and all three of those respondents would have been allowed to vote in some of the counties in California?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1387.14,1387.406,Correct.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.406,1389.472,And they have not been allowed to vote in your county.
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1406.643,1424.443,"Well, I believe Your Honor that we spoke on to that in the final part of our amicus brief and that is the idea that although the application itself as it exists at the present time maybe wrong or was wrong until --"
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1424.443,1425.559,To be unconstitutional?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1425.559,1427.102,Maybe unconstitutional.
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.922,1437.43,They haven’t done it so far?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1437.43,1438.26,"No, they have not."
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.26,1442.141,And you don’t follow the facts that it would be accuracy of the Secretary of the State's report?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1442.141,1444.525,"No, absolutely not."
1973.72-1589,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1463.165,1464.65,But they had their opportunity here?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1464.65,1467.069,"They did, but they didn’t take it."
1973.72-1589,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.069,1475.784,"And it is true is it not that these respondents, all of them would have been allowed to vote in some counties in California?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1475.784,1478.0,I agree heartedly Your Honor.
1973.72-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.0,1485.388,"Although if we were to affirm it here on that narrow ground, would that preclude your legislature then?"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1488.397,1492.018,"Not if the ground was that there was no definition, no Your honor."
1973.72-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.018,1499.311,"But that would still leave unresolved the basic problem, unless that it was just assumed that you had out, unless we said you had --"
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1499.311,1501.5,"Well, that is right if you say we have it."
1973.72-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.644,1506.3,We said nothing you’d still be bound by the Supreme Court of California decision?
1973.72-1589,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1506.3,1506.898,That’s right.
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,1596.215,1597.198,Thank you.
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.452,1640.998,"And when you say if California is completely fenced them out, do you mean these particularly three people?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,1640.998,1652.195,"And the persons they represent, Your Honor, of course, who would not been permitted to vote on the basis of their their prior conviction in spite of their having served their term, and have been released on parole."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1655.1,1660.039,(Inaudible) concern of the persons such as you have just described.
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,1665.028,1665.899,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.852,1811.81,Could that be because of this provision being on the book?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,1811.81,1824.148,"That’s why we were quite careful, Your Honor, to point out not only that there haven’t been any, although we would suggest there would be some first offender surely, but that given the way the system operates, it’s virtually impossible that there would be any."
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2070.888,2076.984,"But as I hear you, you arguing the wisdom of the policy now, aren’t you?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2076.984,2078.031,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2185.968,2189.775,It is limited to the participation in the war between the states?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2189.775,2190.466,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2190.466,2191.329,And that’s all?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2191.329,2191.901,And that’s all.
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2191.901,2194.493,And only crime is related to participation --
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2194.493,2195.358,Exactly.
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2274.621,2283.458,Does the history show that that initial felony -- participation (Inaudible) common or other crime common?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2283.458,2299.075,"No Your Honor, I think that the first draft -- there were no were no reference to other crime at all and that was added later and there are some dispute about when common exactly was added but I do not -- as I read that the history is simply does not aid us very much in terms of discuss."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2299.075,2307.984,"This section have a legislative process, was there a statute which read this way?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2307.984,2310.782,"There was no statute that I’m aware Your Honor, that read precisely in this fashion."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2312.755,2314.406,Why not a federal statute?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2314.406,2314.819,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2409.079,2409.798,Mr. Glick.
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2409.798,2411.124,"Yes, Your Honor, yes Mr. Justice Powell."
1973.72-1589,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2411.124,2421.138,Does your reading of history indicate while at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adapted some or most of the states had laws on this subject?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2421.138,2421.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2478.33,2497.804,Do I sense that you to say -- suggest earlier Mr. Glick that the language of Section 3 shall have engaged in insurrection or prejudice against the same of giving aid or comfort to the enemies thereof cast a gloss on Section 2?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2497.804,2497.974,"Yes, I think it does Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.803,2509.699,You mean they were not concerned about the limitation or other crimes?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2509.699,2516.137,"Well, Your Honor, of course it is a manner of interpretation and there is no clear answer and I wouldn’t suggest that there is."
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.239,2525.551,Don't you think the phrase or other crime is quite clear?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2525.551,2527.084,I do not think so Your Honor because I think --
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2527.084,2530.723,What do you think it means or where does the confusion lie?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2530.723,2531.107,I am sorry.
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2542.529,2554.764,If you don’t think it was recognition that 3/4 of the states are already barred voting for persons convicted of their crimes than rebellion?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2554.764,2556.937,"No, I want to be quite fair."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2598.205,2606.318,"In other words, that is an argument that whatever might be its breadth, it relates only to the diminution of representation?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2606.318,2607.796,"We believe so Your Honor, yes."
1973.72-1589,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2607.796,2612.334,And that leading -- standing independently Section 1 on the equal protection clause?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2612.334,2613.576,Correct.
1973.72-1589,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.576,2632.357,I suppose your argument (Inaudible) by the fact that though the expression chosen is participation in crime rather than conviction of crime which and I take it the disqualifying statutes in the states then is now spoke terms of conviction rather than just participation?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2632.357,2635.457,"That is correct Your Honor, yes."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2635.457,2646.944,"Rather it is a -- but it might be a critical case next term if you should prevail here, what about the convicted felon who is still in your state penitentiary?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2650.258,2662.187,"Your Honor, we think there are significant differences in the person who is in prison and I think it would depend on how those -- and the facts in that case and in that particular state were set out, but let me point out that some of those differences."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2715.533,2728.613,"Apparently the state in this very case asked your Supreme Court to reaffirm I gather long standing case, holding that you could disenfranchise incarcerated felons?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2728.613,2731.535,"That’s correct Your Honor, and there was no dispute about that below --"
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2731.535,2739.062,"Footnote 18, leave that open or simply declined the invitation of the State desire?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2739.062,2749.738,"I think in fairness Your Honor, it was pointed out over and over again at the beginning and the state came forward to emphasis the fact that this case simply doesn’t involve the issue."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2754.544,2758.393,"Well, I gather that's the ground on which the Supreme Court decline to --"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2758.393,2763.982,"That is right, and petitioner Ramirez successfully completed his parole 20 years ago."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2787.561,2789.043,Is that really so?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2825.01,2826.735,"Perhaps, I should have been more clear Your Honor."
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2844.011,2846.158,Even if we facially in other words?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2846.158,2846.731,Precisely.
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2846.731,2850.484,The California Constitution of Prisons do not violate equal protection?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2850.484,2850.668,Precisely.
1973.72-1589,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2850.668,2853.157,"Even if we agree with that, we then we have to go on and reach --"
1973.72-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.157,2869.272,"We wouldn't because the California Court didn’t deal with that question and normally, we -- don’t we give -- normally, we let the state Court pass on the constitutional issue in the first instance, we would remand, leaving that open I suppose?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2869.272,2875.5,"Your Honor, I would suggest that since the question is a Federal question since it was fully argued before the court below, it is the question that rises solely --"
1973.72-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.5,2877.223,"But ain't that arises, right?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2877.223,2878.334,It arises solely.
1973.72-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.403,2880.539,Court right.
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2880.539,2883.997,"They did decide Your Honor respectfully under the Fourteenth Amendment, there were violations."
1973.72-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.997,2885.467,(Inaudible) decide this question?
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2885.467,2888.238,They certainly did not base their decision on the discussion of that.
1973.72-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.238,2896.053,"But under the statute, we normally only review questions -- constitutional questions that had been decided by the State Court?"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2896.053,2899.806,I recognize Your Honor that this Court clearly has wide latitude to deal with the problem.
1973.72-1589,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2915.664,2934.487,"I just -- perhaps we should carry this on private, but we [Laughter] we view judgments here and not opinions and the judgment of the California Supreme Court was that the statute is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause."
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2957.208,2957.635,There's a --
1973.72-1589,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2957.635,2963.589,"I’m sure you’re going to say yes of course, we could do that because we could do whatever five votes [Laughter]"
1973.72-1589,2,35908,martin_r_glick,,2963.589,2969.708,"Your Honor, I would only point out that the three petitions -- three named petitioners in this case are now registered."
1973.72-1589,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.443,3003.975,Thank you gentlemen.
1973.72-1589,3,21041,duncan_m_james,,3011.013,3019.532,"One of the questions that was asked a few minutes ago was whether or not there was statute, a federal statute that went along with the Fourteenth Amendment."
1973.72-1589,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3235.9,3237.398,Is that free?
1973.72-1589,3,21041,duncan_m_james,,3237.398,3238.05,Excuse me?
