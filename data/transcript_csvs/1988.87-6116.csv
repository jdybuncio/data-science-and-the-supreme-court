1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-6116, Steven Penson v. Ohio."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,10.622,18.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.426,159.55,"Of course, the mere fact that the Court found an error that counsel did not find doesn't show that he was effectively deprived of the assistance of counsel."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,162.669,163.386,Well--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.386,172.125,"--That raised nine issues all of which the Court rejected but found, the Court might have found on its own a tenth issue, and you wouldn't--"
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,172.125,172.692,--Well--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.692,174.56,--You wouldn't be able to argue in that case that he was denied effective assistance.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,174.56,176.36,"--Well, I agree with you, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.592,208.465,"What useful relief can we give Mr. Penson in this case, assuming that everything you say is, have said so far is correct?"
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,217.737,220.923,"Well, that is precisely the relief that we are asking."
1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.56,260.666,"Do you make any argument here as to the fact that this error was not harmless, or do you say no harmless error standard can be applied?"
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,260.666,265.986,"We submit that where counsel was denied, this Court has never applied a harmless error standard."
1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.986,268.669,Well... Mr. Penson had counsel.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,270.688,273.99,"Well, counsel was effectively absent, your Honor."
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.734,293.553,You don't know that.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,293.553,294.503,This is a... this is now--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.503,296.421,"He certainly purported to do something, Counsel, didn't he?"
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,296.838,297.421,--The only--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.421,306.444,"--He represented to the Ohio Supreme Court that he had studied the case, and in his judgment, there were no issues that would justify reversal."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,315.733,316.033,--Well--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.033,323.573,"All you know is that counsel, having worked on it, decided, incorrectly, that there was nothing in the case worth arguing."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,324.239,331.428,"--Counsel did state that he carefully reviewed the record, and that he found no reversible errors in the case."
1988.87-6116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.082,339.432,Wasn't the same type of letter in the Anders case?
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,339.432,341.967,--It was exactly... it was exactly a no merit letter.
1988.87-6116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,344.336,346.604,Like the Anders letter case?
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,346.604,347.054,Exactly.
1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.713,414.165,"Well, counsel was appointed here."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,414.165,416.148,Counsel was appointed.
1988.87-6116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.148,420.902,But he... he didn't serve the way he ought to have under the Anders rule.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,424.438,435.162,"Well, of course in the McCoy case, the Court said that count... once the Court determines that there are arguable issues, counsel must be appointed and must be required to file an Anders brief."
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.896,464.615,Anders doesn't assure that the arguable issues will be presented to the Court either.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,481.808,484.077,--That's... it's... that's possible.
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.077,484.46,That's possible.
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,484.46,486.778,That's possible.
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.752,583.358,"We wouldn't say that Anders was not satisfied if this same attorney... let's assume this same attorney, instead of filing a letter with the Court saying"
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,606.307,616.429,"I think not, your Honor, because once the Court gets his brief, then the Court is further required to review the record and make sure that his conclusion is correct."
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.131,620.815,"Oh, I see."
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,635.225,636.743,If the Court disagrees--
1988.87-6116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.743,637.543,I didn't realize--
1988.87-6116,0,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,637.543,638.027,--with counsel--
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1356.858,1363.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-6116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.525,1484.808,"Well, does he have the right--"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1499.184,1504.855,"Well, I would point out that there's been a lot of criticism of the Anders briefing requirement--"
1988.87-6116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1504.855,1507.723,"Well, then we should overrule Anders."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1512.961,1522.0,"--I don't think it exactly overrules Anders, because I think a key feature of the Anders decision is the independent review requirement."
1988.87-6116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1530.388,1546.532,"Well, but we're talking about the duties of counsel, and Anders does have the administrative convenience of requiring attorneys, at least in the first instance, to identify the arguably salient issues in the case."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1556.173,1561.025,"I think counsel is still required to be appointed, and he's still required to review the record."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.994,1592.329,"Well, you sure, if you've got those options."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1602.185,1607.839,"I don't believe so in this case, because the arguable issues had already been raised and decided."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.874,1614.493,But they'd been decided in a manner that did not let this litigant have a lawyer argue his view of those issues.
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1614.493,1621.098,"--Well, he did not have a lawyer argue those issues in the Court of Appeals, I would agree with that."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.181,1624.383,The question is whether he was entitled to have that done for him.
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1624.383,1627.668,"--I don't believe so, under the circumstances of this case."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.668,1630.12,And what is the circumstance that justifies that result?
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1632.77,1648.166,"I believe if the Court finds arguable issues in the record, and those issues have not been raised and have not been litigated, then I think the Court has the option... perhaps the duty... to appoint counsel under Anders."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.649,1650.868,"Well, if you say ""duty"", then why didn't it... then it violated that duty."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1650.868,1654.92,"--I don't believe so in this case, because those issues had already been decided."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.753,1662.675,"But they had been decided in a case to which this litigant was not a party, in which he didn't have a lawyer arguing his view of those issues."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1662.675,1664.108,"--But it is the same record, though."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.447,1676.899,"Well, could you then say that in a joint trial like this, you don't need to appoint lawyers for all three of them, because they're basically the same?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1678.518,1679.668,"Well, I disagree with that."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.237,1681.02,"Well, what's wrong with it?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1681.02,1681.47,--I think--
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.47,1682.82,Why wouldn't that rule apply to that situation?
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1682.82,1688.224,--I think because... you might have some equal protection problems if you did not appoint counsel in the first instance.
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.224,1691.093,"Well, then why don't you have an equal protection problem here?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1691.093,1693.195,"Because I don't believe, according to--"
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.195,1696.329,"Two of them got lawyers, and one did not, and they're similarly situated."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1696.329,1705.252,"--Well, as the Court said, as the Chief Justice said in Ross v. Moffitt, the Fourteenth Amendment does not require absolute equality nor precisely equal advantages."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.252,1713.358,"You can argue here but if you have absolute inequality, of three people, exactly the same position, you give a lawyer to two and not to the third, and there's no inequality there?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1713.358,1718.143,I think there may be an inequality of representation rendered.
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.705,1741.441,"Do you think at the time the Court ruled on the motion to withdraw, it had considered the briefs filed by... on behalf of the other two defendants?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1741.441,1742.127,"Yes, it had."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.079,1745.429,All right.
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1748.547,1751.983,I don't think that's the preferred practice.
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.766,1753.566,"Well, preferred?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1757.053,1758.837,"--Okay, I'll admit that was error."
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1758.837,1759.287,All right.
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1759.287,1760.005,But certainly if that's error--
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.005,1767.676,"And so now, then they find out later on that there are arguable issues in a case in which the person has never... the defendant has never had an argument made for him."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1770.111,1775.765,--Not if they're not issues yet to be raised that have not already been decided.
1988.87-6116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.765,1777.966,Because they've been raised by somebody else representing other clients?
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1777.966,1779.883,"In the same case, based on the same record."
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.883,1784.87,"Well, on that basis, you would never... there would be no obligation to appoint a lawyer in the first place."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1784.87,1786.636,"No, I think that--"
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.636,1791.521,"Suppose there's a request to appoint a counsel, and the Court says,"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1812.768,1816.989,"--I think you would have a problem with Douglas in that situation, your Honor, because counsel--"
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.989,1818.372,"Well, what's the difference between that one and this one?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1818.372,1824.059,--I think the right to counsel guarantees the opportunity to have the assistance of counsel.
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.629,1833.015,"Well, this appellant didn't have the opportunity to have counsel."
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1835.55,1842.454,--Then I think that puts it precisely in the frame of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.108,1855.031,"Well, I know, but he had no... after that he had no representation in the appellate Court on deciding the issues, did he?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1855.031,1855.781,That's true.
1988.87-6116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.781,1870.39,"And you're... what the argument really boils down to is that, is that... well, you can't really tell whether a lawyer done him any good, because you never can tell whether a lawyer would do anything... any good... in which event, why ever appoint a lawyer?"
1988.87-6116,1,36550,mark_b_robinette,,1870.39,1878.662,I think that you can certainly tell better in the framework of the appellate process.
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,2955.669,2975.547,I'm shocked that counsel for the State of Ohio describes this Court's decision in Douglas v. California as a windfall.
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.193,3009.22,"So do you think the... do you think that our decisions, the Court's decisions have now clearly come out to require counsel on appeal, not as a matter of equal protection, but as a matter of some other provision in the Constitution?"
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3009.22,3018.243,"I think as a matter of due process, equal protection, of course guarantee the right to counsel, but the right to effective assistance is required with the Evitts decisions."
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.278,3023.98,This is not a matter of due process?
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3023.98,3028.532,"Well, the Court did rely upon the due process clause in the Evitts decision."
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.384,3031.384,Not the equal protection clause?
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3031.384,3031.601,--No.
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.262,3091.338,"Mr. Ayers, can I ask you a question about your opponent's suggestion that one possible disposition of this case would be to remand it to the Ohio Court of Appeals to decide whether there would be error, assuming it was error... was harmless or not?"
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3098.826,3101.694,"Well, of course."
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.354,3121.024,"But their disposition would give him a lawyer, as I see it now."
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3132.147,3135.784,"Well, I think that points up the whole problem with this process, your Honor."
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.136,3168.672,"Well, you certainly wouldn't be here if you would have won, would you, counsel?"
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3168.672,3170.172,"Well, of course."
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.172,3173.29,And how do you know you wouldn't be here if... if--
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3173.29,3176.009,"Well, not on this issue--"
1988.87-6116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.009,3178.544,--If counsel has been appointed and you are?
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3178.544,3179.896,"--Not on this issue, your Honor."
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.147,3209.832,May I ask another--
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3209.832,3212.784,I think that's the problem with applying a prejudice test in this situation.
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.784,3216.153,--May I ask another question about the practice in Ohio in appointed cases?
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3221.973,3229.811,"There are maximums established by the County, and the lawyer gets paid so much an hour."
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.811,3230.479,So much an hour.
1988.87-6116,2,24888,gregory_l_ayers,,3230.479,3231.546,But... yes.
1988.87-6116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.546,3236.917,"So that he wouldn't get the same amount for filing this, this Anders letter as he would if he'd filed a brief?"
