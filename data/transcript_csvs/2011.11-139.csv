2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-139, United States v. Home Concrete & Supply."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,8.704,11.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.635,59.039,"Well, but only if your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,65.025,79.083,"If the Court in Colony had interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous or if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that would be correct."
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.32,99.264,"Yes, but once -- once we resolve an ambiguity in the statute, that's the law and the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes the law just because going in the language was ambiguous."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,99.264,104.4,I think -- I don't think that the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive definition of the phrase
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.193,158.968,"Well, if they use the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed -- it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere -- I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came in with the baggage it carried from the Colony case; right?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,158.968,166.308,"I think it's important to remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the Colony decision came in 1958."
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.673,198.695,"Yes, but our -- our job is not to plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in mind."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,214.722,229.381,"Well, let me -- let me point to the statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a little bit more fully why we think that the context in which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears bears on the proper interpretation of the disputed phrase."
2011.11-139,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,269.291,274.862,But that -- but that argument hasn't changed between the predecessor statute and this statute.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,288.337,294.674,"--Well, if you look at subparagraph (i), Roman (i) -- or Roman (i) after the general rule, it says:"
2011.11-139,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,311.916,320.439,"My problem with your argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,346.956,360.349,"--As I say, I would agree that if Congress had passed this statute after the Court's decision in Colony, that this would have been a fairly oblique way to reflect an intent to change what the Court had done."
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.539,385.148,"So this language would have one meaning if the very same language were adopted after our decision in -- in Colony, and a different meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our decision in Colony?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,385.148,385.631,--Well--
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.631,390.202,"That's a very strange approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems to me."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,390.202,399.058,"--It -- it may be strange, but I think in a sense it's the Respondents who are striving for strangeness, in the following way--"
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.058,405.812,But -- but you're -- you're saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement Justice Scalia's question so you can continue to answer it.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,425.825,427.475,"--No, I guess there are two things I'm saying."
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.174,488.03,I still don't understand why the world was different after Colony addressed the split than before Colony addressed the split.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,489.466,507.343,"--I guess the way I would respond to your question, Justice Kennedy, is to say if you look at the statute in its current form, both the text of the main rule and the adjacent provisions that contextually bear on its meaning, than I think ours is by far the better interpretation."
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.26,509.793,"Well, by far?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,516.199,516.699,--And what--
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.699,519.985,"Indeed, I think Colony may well have been wrong, but there it is."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,534.745,551.17,"--I guess my main point is, we think our reading of the text is better, and what Respondents have going for them is the argument that, whether or not this is the way you would otherwise construe the statute, once Colony has said what the statute meant, the Court is bound by it."
2011.11-139,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,556.324,557.776,"Mr. Stewart, don't you have two arguments?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,574.803,580.123,"--We do have the power under Brand X, but we -- we don't think that the Court needs to reach that question."
2011.11-139,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,581.975,594.549,"But if the Court thinks it has to reach that question because it agrees more with Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute stays the same, then you have independent Brand X arguments, don't you?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,594.549,595.099,"--Yes, we do."
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,595.099,601.722,"Well, about that argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that Justice Harlan used the term ""ambiguous"", right?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,601.722,602.272,Yes.
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,602.272,606.191,But he was writing very much in a pre-Chevron world.
2011.11-139,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.908,640.097,But he did say that something was unambiguous and that was the little (i) that was added.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,647.418,648.051,That's correct.
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,658.058,672.985,"Is there -- is there a case where we applied Chevron deference to a pre-Chevron opinion, in other words saying, well, the Court looked at that but the Court said it was ambiguous and so we apply Chevron."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,672.985,674.685,I'm not aware of any case.
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.893,703.502,"Even without Chevron -- I mean, even apply it; I would have thought the point of Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and you look at what Congress intended, and where they intended the agency to have power to interpret, you follow the agency."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,734.04,737.826,"Let me give two -- let me give two responses to that, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.804,759.839,"No, well, I didn't think that was the basis."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,853.201,860.871,"--Well, at the time that the 2009 regulation was promulgated first in temporary form, we had lost cases in two courts of appeals."
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.246,876.031,"And what was -- what was the date of that, of Bakersfield?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,876.031,880.768,"That was in, I believe, either -- I believe 2008 was the Ninth Circuit decision in Bakersfield."
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.768,881.184,"Oh, okay."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,881.184,884.803,"It was -- at any rate, it was before the -- the issuance of the regulation in temporary form."
2011.11-139,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,896.361,909.871,"But, Mr. Stewart, prior to this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not controlling any -- any -- any longer?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,909.871,924.297,"Yes, I think probably the best indication of our -- the position in the intervening years, and we agree that there is a surprising dearth of law -- was the Fifth Circuit litigation in Phinney, P-H-I-N-N-E-Y, which was decided in 1968."
2011.11-139,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,961.304,971.528,"And as a result of this case, the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an outdated decision?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,980.484,992.442,"--Well, I -- I think one reason you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code had been enacted in the meantime and the Court went out of its way to say:"
2011.11-139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.063,1025.613,If--
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1025.613,1033.519,--as a taxpayer you would at least be on notice that there was uncertainty as to the proper meaning of the -- the code.
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.333,1083.951,You say in your brief on page 4:
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1101.079,1102.763,I don't know whether--
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.763,1112.535,"And they say that -- and I -- in July 2000, 3 months after they were filed, the Commissioner reiterated his view:"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1123.243,1124.227,"--Well, the--"
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.227,1125.694,Are you talking about the same thing?
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1125.694,1126.078,--No.
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.08,1128.463,Okay.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1139.788,1140.788,"--Well, first of all--"
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.788,1142.323,I'd be rather curious if you could sort that out.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1142.323,1154.131,"--Well, the 2000 notice that the Respondents have cited, I think the -- the most important point to make about it is that it was the view of a single -- of the district counsel for a single district within the IRS."
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.131,1155.731,I -- I know there are many ways of downplaying that.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1160.118,1175.294,"I don't know the exact date in 2000, but it -- it has long been established that transactions lacking economic substance and transactions motivated purely for tax avoidance purposes may be disregarded from -- by the IRS."
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1194.673,1196.291,"Well, yes, that's the general principle."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1209.115,1209.765,--That's--
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.765,1210.567,You can't go back to them.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1210.567,1216.371,"--That's correct, and that's the proposition that the Respondents are citing the different 2000 document for."
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.654,1246.14,At what -- at what level of the IRS bureaucracy can you feel comfortable that the advice you are getting is correct?
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1246.14,1247.074,"--Well, this--"
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.074,1250.675,"A single district counsel, you go to there and say, what do you think?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1254.996,1257.365,--This is not advice to the taxpayer.
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1286.783,1293.538,So -- so what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the same conclusion as the district counsel of the IRS?
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1293.538,1303.394,"--That's correct, but not -- didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in litigating the case in Phinney, didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in--"
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.394,1305.179,What about the -- that's the July.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1333.293,1334.695,--First I would say--
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.695,1336.145,Is that the impression you had?
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1336.145,1341.016,--That notice would not say -- tell you anything relevant to the computation of the assessment period.
2011.11-139,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.016,1341.433,"Okay, all right."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1373.904,1378.224,"Again, I'm not quite sure what you mean by saying, would seem to say that you could do this."
2011.11-139,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.045,1388.997,"Can you clarify, Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up."
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1437.347,1437.763,No.
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.323,1595.429,"Just on that point -- and we will find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to say, well, it's always implicit that you have a basis; everybody knows you have a basis?"
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1595.429,1597.362,I don't think that--
2011.11-139,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.362,1602.1,So that's -- so that's necessarily what you are telling the government.
2011.11-139,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1602.1,1615.843,"--I don't think he will say -- I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say, but I think his position is an overstatement of basis could never trigger the assessment period because the item of gross receipts would have been adequately disclosed."
2011.11-139,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.843,1617.71,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1625.115,1634.887,"Your Honor, our position is the one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross income."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1705.899,1707.933,"Well, why do you think they added that paragraph?"
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1719.541,1722.593,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's probably right."
2011.11-139,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.076,1751.21,Were most of the--
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.21,1753.56,But that's got to -- that's got to refer to (i).
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1789.918,1792.301,"Well, I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1835.697,1839.851,A real estate developer in the business of buying and selling property.
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1848.874,1859.579,"--Your Honor, the sale of real property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always been treated differently than the sale of -- cost of goods or services, which really is a term art."
2011.11-139,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.897,1899.989,"--And I was going to ask in conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the pre-Colony cases that involved splits, did most of those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and services or were they all real estate sales."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1899.989,1902.091,"--Your Honor, the Uptegrove case did, the Third Circuit case."
2011.11-139,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.697,1920.386,"Well, but the Congress drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's question, when it talks just about goods and services."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1920.386,1920.82,It did do that.
2011.11-139,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.545,1936.912,"The other reason, it was goods and services."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1954.993,1971.253,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's the opposite if I understand your question, which is that taxpayers typically put more information which is going to put the IRS on notice when you are dealing with basis and the sale of property as opposed to the costs of goods and services, which involve many transactions and you are dealing with them in the aggregate."
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.444,2010.494,But why would they be redundant?
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2035.345,2046.051,"--Your Honor, everyone agrees it's not redundant, even the government, because what it does is at a minimum, it has the computational effect of affecting the 25 percent trigger."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2048.236,2052.105,But you agree that that's not why Congress passed that provision?
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2052.105,2054.223,"--Well, it's not clear, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2185.024,2187.343,"Well, Mr. Garre where do you find evidence of that?"
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2216.746,2225.784,"I think what my response would be first as to Phinney, the Fifth Circuit has clarified that the government's construction of Phinney is just wrong."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2230.672,2239.194,"Well, whatever the Fifth Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it seems to me to cut in the government's direction if not to be entirely on all fours."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2248.217,2250.817,If I could make one point on Phinney and then I will address the other cases.
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2310.957,2323.615,"Because what I was thinking, Mr. Garre, and tell me what you think the consequence of this would be, is that if I were a taxpayer and somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I would have said, well, I can't tell you 100 percent."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2343.678,2350.682,"Well, I don't know how you would put a percentage on in affect whether Colony was a step I case or not."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2350.682,2354.986,"Well, in terms of what a taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2354.986,2355.736,I think so.
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2379.468,2396.896,"And it also says before that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the speculative debate between the parties as to whether Congress manifested an intention to clarify or change this 1939 code."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2421.612,2429.784,"--Justice Ginsburg, the government in Colony argued that the 1954 amendments compelled its interpretation which is the one that the Court rejected."
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.281,2466.223,"But as I read it, it doesn't say, as Colony controls, it's saying we are not going to take the position on what the 1954 code does, whether it clarifies or changes."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2466.223,2469.877,"I think that the prefatory language there I think you're right, that's a fair characterization."
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2479.717,2488.656,"But he says ""unambiguous language"", and he can't mean the general rule because he's already said that is ambiguous."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2494.31,2497.262,"I don't think it has to be (i), Your Honor."
2011.11-139,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.89,2519.794,"Before -- if I could just interrupt you, before you do so, to follow up on Justice Kagan's question."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2548.027,2551.996,"--Well, we do disagree with it -- I mean, I certainly accept the Brand X part of that."
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2568.175,2577.131,"Well, they can't -- they can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they are the agency with expertise to define a term within a statute."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2583.701,2593.675,"--Well, they don't have any leeway to overturn this Court's decision if that decision specifically addressed the question."
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.558,2604.531,"Oh, if it is -- according to Brand X, it specifically addressed the question and said that there was no ambiguity."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2617.708,2618.874,--Brand X says that--
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.874,2627.913,"So the only question here is, as the Chief Justice put it, whether, whether indeed Colony meant by ""ambiguous"", ambiguous."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2627.913,2628.929,--I--
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.929,2631.265,"It depends on what the meaning of ""ambiguous"" is, right?"
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2632.467,2634.133,"--I don't think so, for this reason."
2011.11-139,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2646.893,2654.297,"I can hardly think of a statutory interpretation question that we have gotten that doesn't involve some degree of ambiguity, if we're honest about it."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2672.425,2679.864,"Well, I would, I would think that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the first step of Chevron."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2703.064,2709.05,"Well, that was the specific situation, but then the question was how clearly did Congress speak to that specific situation."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2736.785,2739.987,"--Well, I would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2758.198,2760.198,"Well, in the end there has to be a resolution."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2774.791,2779.362,"He was employing the traditional tools of statutory construction, not just legislative history."
2011.11-139,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2786.699,2792.871,"But he did say -- he say he was looking to -- he said the text isn't clear; therefore, I look to the legislative history."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2792.871,2795.337,--And that's the tool of statutory construction.
2011.11-139,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2795.337,2796.823,I agree with you on that.
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2940.647,2944.551,"Well, I think you would first look at the language of the regulation and see whether or not--"
2011.11-139,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2944.551,2945.817,"""Open"", that's the term."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2945.817,2947.419,--by its terms it applies retroactively.
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.297,2987.544,"I never thought that a revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes that were committed before that alteration, is retroactive legislation."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2987.544,2988.163,"Well, I--"
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.163,2998.686,"You know, the crucial date is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend the statute of limitations."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2998.686,3007.207,"--I think it's retroactive in the worst way, for this reason: It at a minimum extinguishes an affirmative defense, the statute of limitations."
2011.11-139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.176,3020.032,"So say it's unfair, but I'm not sure that the rule against, presumption against retroactivity, technically applies."
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3020.032,3039.696,"Well, again, I mean, I think if you look at Landgraf and the cases talking about what is retroactive, this regulation here if it is applied retroactively has the consequence this Court points to as the worst kind of retroactivity, which is extinguishing a valid defense in litigation and imposing new consequences for past actions."
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3045.166,3047.701,Presumptively because you're saying that this is a new interpretation.
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3058.474,3063.894,"And with all due respect, the law in 2003 when the statute of limitations expired was Colony."
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3090.545,3092.83,There's too many presumptions in your answer.
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3095.182,3096.932,"--No, no--"
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3096.932,3101.936,--which to me itself says it's not -- it's not interpreting the new statute--
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3101.936,3103.871,--My point on that--
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3103.871,3104.955,--whatever its footnote meant.
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3104.955,3119.798,"--No, my point on that was not that Colony controlled as a step one matter, it's that even if the government is right that Colony just said this is one permissible reading, it was the law as -- it was the permissible reading and the law until the government changed it."
2011.11-139,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3149.184,3152.519,Do you -- do you understand the preamble as part of the regulation?
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3165.093,3165.911,"--No, no."
2011.11-139,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3284.873,3291.842,"I take your point about the purpose, but you would have to ignore every rule of grammar that there is in order to read it your way, don't -- wouldn't you?"
2011.11-139,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3291.842,3298.698,Not if you read regulations which relate to statutory provisions as -- as one thing.
2011.11-139,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3406.885,3408.603,"Thank you, counsel."

2011.11-139,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3410.871,3412.421,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-139,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3494.673,3498.66,"Mr. Stewart, I know you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you get it out, but you mentioned Brand X."
2011.11-139,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3507.749,3513.07,"No, I mean -- Brand X was the first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the Court has not applied it since."
2011.11-139,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.203,3516.105,That was applying it to a court of appeals decision.
2011.11-139,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3516.105,3517.489,--That was applying it to a court of appeals decision.
2011.11-139,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3517.489,3520.474,We've never said an agency can change what we've said the law means.
2011.11-139,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3520.474,3520.841,No.
2011.11-139,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3581.281,3582.214,"Thank you, counsel."
