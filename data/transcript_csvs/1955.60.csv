1955.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.84,"Mr. Rosenblum, you may proceed."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,11.84,14.405,If the Court please.
1955.60,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,432.478,448.445,Didn't the crime under the first statute failure to pay the payholder while the crime under that 3616 is the failure to deliver or dispose his account?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,448.445,457.818,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the applicable section of this 145 (b) as in any person who willfully attempts in any manner to defeat or evade his income taxes shall be guilty."
1955.60,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,457.818,475.139,"(Voice Overlap) shall be awfully account, isnt he?Am I reading correctly on page 2 of the Government's brief, the statute, payholder, any tax be imposed or truthfully account for a payover of such tax?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,475.139,483.663,And any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by -- imposed by this chapter.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,494.331,527.966,"May I ask you if -- if the requested charge had been given under this indictment, under the fact that -- or in evidence in this case, was there anything in -- could -- could an offense that an offense have been found under 3616 could not have been found under 145?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,527.966,531.659,"Well, the answer to that, Your Honor, is that I believe not."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,531.659,532.532,Not.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,532.532,534.76,I believe not.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,534.76,545.398,"Well, there was nothing to that -- still definitely is in the argument -- state your argument, 3616 and something that was carved out of --"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,545.398,545.627,No.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,545.627,548.536,-- with the matter which is identical with 145 (b).
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,548.536,548.891,The Government --
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,548.891,549.487,Is that right?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,549.487,550.018,Yes.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,610.012,611.437,And what is your proposition?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,611.437,625.827,"Our proposition is, Your Honor, that that doesn't tell us the whole story, that we go further, that there is another aspect of the rule including lesser concluded offenses which on reasoning and authority is simply this."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,661.975,673.873,"But that doesn't answer my question a minute ago.You agreed that here there was not a difference of offenses between 145 (b) and 3616, what I tell you."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,673.873,674.696,Correct.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,674.696,681.608,"Well then, how, if there's identity can be lesser or greater -- in any sense lesser and greater as it means?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,681.608,682.208,"In the sense, Your Honor --"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,682.208,683.544,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,683.544,684.867,"No, all right."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,685.961,689.805,-- how lesser can have any just come into play when you got identity.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,689.805,701.733,"In the sense, Your Honor, that there is a difference between a felony and a misdemeanor in a sense, Your Honor, that there is a great difference between subjected to five years in the penitentiary and a $10,000 fine on the one hand and being subjected to one year --"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,701.733,709.953,I understand that but that has nothing to do with the -- the identity or non-identity of new offenses.
1955.60,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,720.618,732.698,"Your -- your position is that if charge is two offenses and one of them is a felony and the one is a misdeamenor, you must charge that he's entitled to be convicted only of the misdeamenor, is that it?"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,732.698,736.459,"Only, Your Honor, if the proof required is identical."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,747.459,754.012,"Suppose there were nothing, suppose the indictment has no indication under what statute, the thing is broad."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,754.012,755.263,That's correct.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,755.763,772.473,"Then -- then would the judge charge for the jury, you must bring in, since the punishment consist to be equally under 3616 and I lead them to go only a year when under 145 (b), I should give five years, you must tell me what I should give, is that it?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,772.473,773.707,"No, no."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,789.684,797.733,"Well, tell -- tell me what -- what instruction as the filing of fact because jury finds fact."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,802.676,816.122,That if the jury finds that the facts in alleging the indictment that the defendant has filed a false return with the intent to defeat his assessment that the jury shall return a conviction under Section 3616.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,816.122,822.294,It's not the business of a jury to label an offense.That's the business of the Court.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,822.294,826.122,"Well, it is our position here, Your Honor, that the Court had no alternative but to sentence under a --"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,826.122,833.862,"You may well be -- no, you may well be right as to what sentence should be imposed, but I -- I like to specify my question."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,849.27,851.465,There would be no facts that would be different.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,853.833,856.481,Then I have nothing more to say.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,856.481,874.438,"However, I don't think that even accepting that position which we quite willingly accepted in the brief, supports the Government's position that it had a choice, an election to prosecute under 145 and that the -- and that the trial judge had the right to sentence under a felony."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,911.57,913.001,That's nothing to do with the Government.
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,924.386,946.222,"Suppose Congress, instead of doing this, has defined the attempts, said that the judge shall submit to the jury the power to determine whether it's guilty of the felony or the misdeamenor, and the Court shall fix prices accordingly, would that be a valid statute?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,946.222,949.879,"I wouldn't think so, Your Honor, unless you set up some ascertainable standard which is our --"
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,949.879,951.117,Suppose it claimed that.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,964.166,965.938,I wouldn't think so.
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,965.938,968.006,Do you mean Congress doesn't do that?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,969.595,970.523,Not unless there's some --
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,970.523,973.781,"There's just one attempt there, just take one attempt."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,980.283,981.534,For one single offense?
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,981.534,981.812,Yes.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,981.812,983.06,"Yes, I misunderstood your question."
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,983.06,983.411,All right.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,983.411,984.162,That will be perfectly all right.
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,984.162,1004.667,"How would you define the same offense and when it choose to do it in that statute, define the same offense instead of simply using the common method of giving the jury the right to fix the punishment with its ranges said they can fix either one that they do it by finding him guilty of the ones that was the greater or the lesser, could they do that?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1034.52,1039.681,"Well, that is correct."
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1051.382,1057.86,Is the Government taking the position that the prosecuting attorney can choose between the two where the --
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1057.86,1059.781,"Oh, yes, the Government says that --"
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1059.781,1063.209,Just merely by saying we charge him under this one instead of the other one?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1063.209,1084.085,"Yes and the Government tells us in Footnote 9 in its brief, page 13, that while it is traditionally used 3616 (a) and its -- its Footnote 9, page 23, “We have traditionally used these two statutes in order to make a choice.”"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1118.214,1123.586,But the two statutes are not always overlapping.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1140.494,1141.096,There may be --
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1141.096,1144.605,"-- is a more restricted statute than 145 (b), is that right?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1144.605,1145.253,That is correct.
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1164.358,1166.304,But were the facts are different?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1166.304,1166.606,Your Honor?
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1166.753,1168.645,What do you mean when the facts are different?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1168.645,1169.678,"Well, that is correct."
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1201.55,1206.827,"I presume what you're arguing basically is that, here, the facts would -- identical."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1206.827,1207.669,That's correct.
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1207.669,1212.681,"Insofar as the Act of (Inaudible) concerned, there could be charge on the (Inaudible)"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1212.681,1213.126,And were --
1955.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1213.126,1225.811,"But that you are saying that giving criminal statutes a very strict and narrow construction, the Government shouldn't be given the power to prosecute for a greater offense rather than the small ones."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1225.811,1226.513,That is correct.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1266.986,1272.699,Have you -- have you taken a position anywhere in the course of this litigation?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1284.229,1284.902,Yes.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1285.695,1286.304,What?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1286.304,1287.154,"Yes, we have."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1287.154,1291.657,That it exceeded its power in imposing sentence.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1342.812,1347.473,"I believe that you will find a suggestion to that effect, Your Honor, in the brief."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1364.392,1367.357,But your position that the petitioner be consummated?
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1367.357,1367.984,"No, Your Honor."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1388.666,1392.624,"And he served the, what would be a year sentence?"
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1392.624,1393.958,Only eight months.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1393.958,1408.392,"So that if -- if that crime is taken, then -- then the problem arises and that you thought to get him out on habeas corpus on that theory that the (Inaudible) if we have a difference question, wouldn't we?"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1408.392,1414.65,"It might be, yes, but of course, keep in mind that he was convicted here on three counts and the trial should --"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1414.65,1416.401,(Inaudible)
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1416.401,1433.023,"Yes, but if the question is a matter of resentencing, and -- and we can see that under the Government's theory in a position we would agree with, that perhaps the question here is one of resentencing, that he's not entitled to a new trial because there would be nothing that the jury could find different than it's found the first time."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1618.198,1622.978,And it wasn't ruled on this law of transgression from trying to about it.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1643.619,1645.781,"I don't agree with that, and I don't agree with it --"
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1645.781,1649.262,You can't disagree because that's done every day in the U.S. Attorney's office.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1649.262,1649.698,All right.
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1654.202,1658.981,I'm just saying there's a large area of discretion which is inescapable.
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1658.981,1665.94,"But the statute itself tells a district attorney what the difference in proof is, what the standard is and that we don't have here."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1683.927,1696.224,"Your (Inaudible) shows to tell you to state that -- that so far as the jury knows, not one with of a different charge goes to the jury under one statute than the other."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1713.883,1716.502,"Well, I think Your Honor, that stems from a basic disagreement."
1955.60,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1718.552,1738.497,"Well, lesser means less than something different in – as a linear thing, six inches is less than nine inches, or A equals A or X equals X or X equals S, can you demonstrate X equals lesser unless you would give us something then talk by those meanings."
1955.60,0,41985,stanley_m_rosenblum,,1738.497,1741.301,"Well, let's look at a case in which the Government relies."
1955.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1940.799,1944.122,Mr. Elman.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,1944.122,1946.209,May it please the Court.
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.047,1983.933,"But you opened it up, didn't you, in your brief?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,1984.936,1989.546,"I mean, I should be very happy to argue the point, sir, if the Court considers it open."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1989.546,1993.129,"You did opened it up, didn't you, and go farther than that?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,1993.129,2013.315,"We argued, sir that the petitioner's contention as to the lesser included offense instruction, if accepted, would in effect repeal Section 145 (b) as applied to the filing of false and fraudulent returns."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2022.517,2023.682,"Well, I'd like to hear it argued, please."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2023.682,2026.295,"Yes, sir, I'd be very happy."
1955.60,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2031.822,2038.733,No question referred by anyone as to the validity of either one of the statutes.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2038.733,2053.619,"The -- the petitioner's position and ours is that Section 145 and Section 3616 (a), both appearing in the same statute 1939 Code, are both valid."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2062.754,2065.233,"Well, do you agree -- I don't like to bother you with that."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2065.233,2065.743,I'm fine.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2066.23,2073.687,"(Voice Overlap) Do you agree with me on -- on the facts on this case, they could be convicted on that either?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2073.687,2074.149,"Yes, sir."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2083.293,2087.397,(Voice Overlap) require anymore proof of the judgment --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2087.397,2087.514,"No, sir."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2087.514,2090.121,-- to convict of the one than the other.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2090.121,2090.455,"No, sir."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2326.434,2328.348,That means to say it has --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2328.348,2332.306,"It says -- well, it says any return."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2332.516,2334.445,What is the date -- what -- what does he argue?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2335.901,2341.388,"This statute, 3616 (a) goes back to the Revenue Act of 1798 that's been reenacted time and again --"
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2341.388,2344.861,That explains the word -- that explains the word “evaluation.”
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2347.34,2351.294,"Customs, excised taxes, floor stock taxes."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2514.775,2527.745,Are you expecting there Mr. Elman that the Congress intended to give the District Attorney unlimited choice between charging a man with a felony and a misdemeanor for the same conduct?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2527.745,2531.926,"Well, we're not arguing, if I may answer the question this way."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2536.658,2543.622,But you were just talking about what Congress intended to do in income taxes as I understood you.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2543.622,2551.016,"Well, the intention of Congress on this must appear from its provision, from what Congress did."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2689.624,2702.907,Unless the 145 broken down in the statute and don't they -- don't they specify various crimes that -- that are of the nature of 145 (b)?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2702.907,2705.423,"Well, the -- the --"
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2705.423,2706.909,So far as as primary tax is concerned.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2706.909,2711.674,"Yes, sir, 145 (b) covers a failure to pay over any tax."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2711.674,2713.688,Yes.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2713.688,2723.989,"Failure to collect the truth for the account, go and pay over the tax and any person who willfully attempt, in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2734.05,2742.581,But what do you mean exactly rather sections of the Internal Revenue Code that prohibit violations of it --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2742.581,2743.074,"Yes, sir."
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2743.074,2744.681,-- that -- that would be included by his --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2744.681,2745.002,Not only --
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2745.002,2747.069,-- his cover all --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2747.069,2747.466,Not only --
1955.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2747.466,2749.798,-- in Section 145?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2749.798,2752.886,"Not only in the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Chief Justice."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2926.726,2942.905,"Would it -- would it be that fair if the -- if it -- if both statutes applied, if both statutes applied in fact that are identical, why would it be placed as facts to the jury by guilt as concerned?It might be a question of gradation of which it extends punishment?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2942.905,2948.15,"Well, the issue of guilt or innocence was submitted to the jury."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2948.15,2950.71,And they have -- and they submitted as to both as to this one too.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2950.71,2964.234,"But -- but the petitioner did not -- did not ask anything more than that the jury be allowed to bring in a verdict of guilt which would -- which would say, “Guilty under 3616 (a) and not 145(b).”"
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2974.524,2978.921,It's ordinarily true but I assume it could that the -- the law has provided --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2978.921,2979.235,"Well, I --"
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2979.235,2982.155,-- that they had the right to determine under a different challenge.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2982.155,2982.789,"Well, on what basis --"
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2982.789,2987.296,"(Voice Overlap) difference between in this case from this one, I think may be the answer -- and I'd like to get to it as (Voice Overlap)."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,2987.296,2989.271,"Yes, sir."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2989.271,3000.45,"Suppose Congress at 140 -- Section 145 had said that it should be a felony punishable by 10 years in penitentiary, steals $20 from a store."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3019.307,3020.462,"Yes, sir, there would be substantial difference --"
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3020.462,3023.384,In fact with the facts that I'm giving you one on a different kind.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3023.384,3027.795,The question of which law would govern might arise in the -- in a variety of context.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3060.737,3074.684,"(Voice Overlap) the procedure of -- what I want to know is, what would be the effect of two laws like that assuming that they've raised whatever is to be raised in the proper manner?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3088.687,3101.799,"I think, Mr. Justice that if Congress were to enact the law saying that murder shall be a felony or a misdemeanor and the discretion of the Attorney General or the discretion of the jury (Voice Overlap) I think it would be a serious constitutional question."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3101.799,3102.569,Yes.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3102.569,3103.261,I think so.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3103.261,3104.383,"Well, that -- that was --"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3104.383,3114.931,"But I don't think that's this case, because Congress hasn't said -- Congress hasn't said the filing of a false income tax return shall be either a felony or a misdemeanor."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3114.931,3117.159,"But it is here, isn't it?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3119.489,3121.881,Under the -- under the indictment in this case --
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3121.881,3123.009,And the facts.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3123.009,3129.669,"And the facts, a conviction under either statute is valid."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3151.304,3155.087,But has there been any standard given here?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3155.087,3162.362,"There isn't any -- there isn't any standard given here, sir, because there's no -- there's -- there's no choice that was made here by the Attorney General."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3163.89,3164.85,Who made the choice?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3168.325,3168.596,No.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3189.845,3190.367,Even -- even though --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3190.367,3195.152,He doesn't have to have an -- an Attorney General write a citation of the indictment.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3195.152,3223.347,"But what -- when you have, you have in effect -- I'm not talking about actually, you have in effect two statutes, both of which provides punishment, define a particular crime and this instance is precisely the same way, as I understand it, covered precisely the same facts, it makes one a felony and one a misdemeanor."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3229.303,3229.839,"Well, let me --"
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3229.839,3246.331,"What I'm concerned, they've raised the question as to whether, I would suppose, at least, whether it should be held that the Attorney General or the prosecuting officer or the judge or anybody else can just pick one of them out and they were given the (Inaudible)"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3246.331,3250.814,"Mr. Justice, this argument -- this argument is not a new one."
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.523,3362.686,"Well, that –-"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3362.686,3365.038,That's a fortiori from this case.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3365.038,3367.936,But that's -- that I -- but I just want to find that out from you.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3380.519,3381.042,That was conceded in that case.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3381.042,3382.487,(Voice Overlap) –-
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3382.487,3384.378,In the -- that was stated in the Gilliland case.
1955.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3387.207,3401.302,"I'm not -- I'm not talking about ""could have,"" but at the same language or was a different statutes in different language and if -- if not, they were the same."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3405.931,3429.166,"The -- the language of two statutes was not precisely identical but they are closer to one another than the two statutes here because in Gilliland case, you had general false statement statute about making false statements to an -- a representative or agency of the United States, and the Hot Oil Act said, “Making a false statement to the Secretary of the Interior on a -- on the form provided for by his regulations, you see."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3483.76,3489.628,"Mr. Elman, before you sit down, I'd like to, if I might have stated what really is this -- this case is about?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3511.962,3512.071,"Yes, sir."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3512.071,3514.037,That's the issue before the Court of Appeals.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3514.579,3516.098,Certiorari was limited to that issue.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3516.098,3516.452,When we --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3516.452,3516.954,Certiorari was --
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3516.954,3524.719,"(Voice Overlap) namely, refusal to grant a charge which it was error to refuse."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3527.382,3528.642,216.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3528.642,3530.27,216.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3531.6,3533.91,Then it's requested instruction number 12.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3533.91,3535.602,"Number 12, not the end of it."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3539.293,3539.507,Yes.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3539.507,3542.457,That's evidently part of the requested charge that's being denied.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3542.457,3543.194,That's right.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3543.194,3552.29,What I want to know is what is there in that charge that bears on the allegations of the indictment?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3561.115,3562.719,The answer is nothing.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3562.908,3564.278,But ultimately an error in that offenses.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3564.278,3569.28,"On page -- if Your Honor is going to the record, I would suggest too that you look at one --"
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3569.28,3571.585,Sometimes it's not under the record in the case.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3571.585,3573.577,I will not quarrel with you on that.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3604.146,3615.947,"If everything in that gets to elect the question of query is contained in the charge given by the Court, he doesn't have to give the same thing and the same words or different words asked by the defense."
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3615.947,3622.169,"Well, I -- I really believe that if that charge had been given, the jury would have been utterly confused."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3706.137,3706.381,Now let's --
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3706.381,3706.602,Now --
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3706.602,3707.58,-- talk about that.
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3721.073,3721.635,"I believe so, yes."
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3721.635,3732.715,"And it wasn't raised for both -- it couldn't be raised prematurely i.e., it couldn't be raised until the proper sentence, the legal sentence has been served, is that right?"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3732.715,3733.475,I think so.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3735.103,3735.404,Pardon?
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3735.404,3738.092,I speak hesitantly because I haven't researched upon it lately.
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3738.092,3752.203,"(Voice Overlap) out of conviction, but am I right though that assuming that since 2255, that is no longer a choice, that you could go back if that's removed before the sentencing forth or resentencing --"
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3752.203,3752.681,"Well, I believe --"
1955.60,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3752.681,3753.365,(Voice Overlap)
1955.60,1,37869,philip_elman,,3753.747,3758.864,I believe under Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
